<p>FADE IN</p>

<ol>
    <li>EXT.CALIFORNIA BEACH â
        DAY 1<p>Seagulls
        squawk, and the waves pound, but weâre not talking
        about Malibu Colony, here. This is a fairly rundown beach
        area, catering to lower-echelon surfers, vagrants, and
        strung out druggies of all ages, several of whom stand or
        sit on their haunches by a dilapidated old hamburger
        stand. Over the stand is a faded sign: "FAT
        SAMâS HAMBURGERS".</p>
        <p>A simple but haunting
        electronic melody plays in the b.g.</p>
    </li>
    <li>INT. "FAT
        SAMâS" â DAY 2<p>Seated just inside the stand on a
        folding aluminum chair is a chubby man in his late
        thirties. Heâs wearing a stained valor sweat suit
        and a cap. This is Fat Sam. Heâs a dealer. Seated on
        the sand next to him is Fletch, a rangy man, early
        thirties, in jeans and a Magic Johnson T-shirt, nodding
        idly on a battered Casio music machine which he treats
        lovingly. This is the source of the title music.</p>
        <p align="center">FLETCH</p>
        <p align="center">So what do
        you figure?</p>
        <p align="center">FAT SAM</p>
        <p align="center">No idea.</p>
        <p align="center">FLETCH</p>
        <p align="center">No idea at
        all?</p>
        <p align="center">FAT SAM</p>
        <p align="center">Okay. Some
        idea.</p>
        <p align="center">FLETCH</p>
        <p align="center">Like when?</p>
        <p align="center">FAT SAM</p>
        <p align="center">Like
        tonight.</p>
        <p align="center">FLETCH</p>
        <p align="center">For sure?</p>
        <p align="center">FAT SAM</p>
        <p align="center">No, not for
        sure. When it comes, it comes. 
        You gonna want some $hit?</p>
        <p align="center">FLETCH</p>
        <p align="center">I think
        Iâd rather have drugs.</p>
    </li>
    <li>CONTINUED</li>
</ol>

<p align="center">FAT SAM</p>

<p align="center">(shakes head and
smiles)</p>

<p align="center">Fletchâ¦</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH</p>

<p align="center">Sorry. I find a
little humor really brightens</p>

<p align="center">things up around
here, donât you?</p>

<p>A young junkie with a black eye
â Gummy â passes.</p>

<p align="center">GUMMY</p>

<p align="center">Hi Sam. Hi Fletch.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH</p>

<p align="center">Hi Gummy.
Howâs the eye?</p>

<p align="center">GUMMY</p>

<p align="center">Itâs okay. The
cops did it.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH</p>

<p align="center">I know.</p>

<p align="center">GUMMY</p>

<p align="center">They busted me last
week.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH</p>

<p align="center">They bust you every
week.</p>

<p align="center">GUMMY</p>

<p align="center">I know. I got bad
luck or something.</p>

<p>Gummy exits. Fletch and Fat Sam
watch him go.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH</p>

<p align="center">That kid spends any
more time in jail</p>

<p align="center">Heâll have to
start paying rent.</p>

<p align="left">WIDER ANGLE THROUGH BINOCULARS</p>

<p align="left">Fat Sam and Fletch conclude their
conversation. Fletch walks back among the drifters, the nervous,Â expectant junkies. He stops to talk to a young man propped up on his elbows on a towel.Â Â Â  Creasy.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="4">Â  </font><font face="Prestige Elite" size="3">CREASY
He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam.Â Â Â  Never
leaves.
Sits in that chair, he's outta junk.Â Â Â  Then he
suddenly
gets up, he's got junk.Â Â Â  So where does it come
from?
Through the sand?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4">Â  </font><font face="Prestige Elite" size="3">FLETCH

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">---</font>Stanwyk ignores Fletch and starts toward

<p align="center">FLETCH
Then I found out Hopalong Cassidy had
shot himself in the game room. That

<p align="center">STANWYK
Who?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Hopalong Cassidy. Killed himself here.
Bow and arrow. Strange.</p>

I don't feel sick. Not yet. They tell me it'll
start getting bad in about a month. After that...
well, I'd rather not be around for it.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Why don't you try suicide?</p>

<p align="center">STANWYK
My company has taken out a very large insurance
policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would 
nullify my insurance. Murder does not.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
So why pick me?</p>

<p align="center">STANWYK
You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression --
beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. 
I've watched you for a couple weeks.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Maybe I'm just on vacation.</p>

<p align="center">STANWYK
Not with the scum you hang out with. I've watched.
I've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect
escape plan for you.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I have the same problem with my help.</p>

<p align="center">STANWYK
(goes on, unresponsive)
I will be here in the room, waiting for you.
The safe will be open and there will be fifty
thousand dollars in it. You will be wearing
rubber gloves. Do you own rubber gloves?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I rent them. Monthly lease, with an option to buy.</p>

<p align="center">STANWYK
Very good. <u>My</u> .357. Use it and no one can
trace it to you. The room will be in some disarray.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
So it looks like a burglary attempt. You
catch me. I get the gun, and shoot you.</p>

<p align="center">STANWYK
Precisely. Are you a good shot?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
(looking at the huge gun)
What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.</p>

<p align="center">STANWYK
Get me on the first shot, if you can.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I don't think you'll have to worry about that.</p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">---</font>A beat. Stanwyk stares at Fletch.</p>

<p align="center">STANWYK
Do you have a passport?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Sure, all drifters do.</p>

<p align="center">STANWYK
Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar.
The keys will be in the glove compartment.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Take it where?</p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">---</font>Stanwyk starts to write down the

<p align="center">STANWYK

Where am I going?</p>

<p align="center">STANWYK
(hands Fletch the note)
Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
They serve dinner on the flight?</p>

<p align="center">STANWYK
It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll 
enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there
at least a year, Mr. Fletcher.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?</p>

<p align="center">STANWYK
I am not someone who leaves a great deal
to chance, Mr. Fletcher.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
You sure those doors will be open?</p>

<p align="center">STANWYK
Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport,
and the aim. I'll take care of everything else.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying.</p>

<p align="center">STANWYK
That's right.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
You sure got the hard part.</p>

Sure, but the end was so sudden.</p>

<p align="center">DR. DOLEN
He was in intensive care for eight weeks.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Yes, but the <u>very</u> end, when he actually died,
that was extremely sudden.
(quickly)
You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of
dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of 
insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind
of perfect health to get that kind of policy.</p>

Well, I can't find anything wrong with you.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe
I should get a real complete physical. You give
Alan an annual, don't you?</p>

<p align="center">DR. DOLEN
Yeah, we check you into Mt. Hebron for a few days,
run lots of tests, charge a bundle. You can pull

<p align="center">PATHOLOGIST
Come on, come on.</p>

<p align="left">Reluctantly, he goes
to the autopsy table, and the cadaver thereon, which is covered
by a sheet, except for the mid-section.</p>

<p align="center">58 TWO SHOT -
FLETCH AND PATHOLOGIST</p>

<p align="left">(Note: from here on
we never see the body.)</p>

<p align="center">PATHOLOGIST
(poking around)
Have you ever see a spleen this large?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
(trying not to look)
Not recently.</p>

<p align="center">PATHOLOGIST
Grab this, will you?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Uh, I'm not really prepared. My hands aren't sterilized.</p>

<p align="center">PATHOLOGIST
You're not going to make this guy any sicker.</p>

<p align="left">We hear a squishing
noise as he grabs something large and wet and plops it into
Fletch's hand. Fletch stands there holding something icky out of
frame, looking uncomfortably up at the ceiling, the floor,
anywhere but at the cadaver or at the stuff in his hand.
Meanwhile, we hear sounds of further incisions, and the deflating
of an organ.</p>

<p align="center">PATHOLOGIST
You never really get used to the smell, do you?</p>

<p align="left">Fletch's eyes roll
up, and he falls to the floor in a dead faint.</p>

<p align="center">59 INT. RECORDS
ROOM - DAY - MINUTES LATER</p>

<p align="left">Fletch is on a couch,
beginning to regain consciousness. The Records Nurse hovers over
him.</p>

<p align="center">RECORDS NURSE
Are you all right, Doctor?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Where am I?</p>

<p align="center">RECORDS NURSE
You're in the Records Room.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I'm fine.</p>

<p align="center">RECORDS NURSE
Can I get you something?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.</p>

<p align="center">RECORDS NURSE
Doctor Holmes went to get you some smelling salts. 
He was quite surprised that you fainted.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Well, I didn't want to say anything, but I thought
the dead man was my brother.</p>

<p align="center">RECORDS NURSE
Oh my God!</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
It's all right. It wasn't him but
that spleen was a splitting image.</p>

<p align="left">He sits up and sees
that just outside the glass is none other that Dr. Joseph Dolen,
talking with the pathologist.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Oh, God, I think I'm about to hyperventilate.
Have you got a paper bag, or something.</p>

<p align="center">RECORDS NURSE
Yes, right away.</p>

<p align="center">She goes to get the
paper bag, and Fletch turns his back on Dr. Dolen to go through
the file cabinet. By the time the Nurse returns, he's got
Stanwyk's file.</p>

<p align="center">RECORDS NURSE
Here you are, Doctor.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Thank you.</p>

<p align="left">He puts the bag over
his mouth and breathes deeply as he continues the conversation
with her. (From time to time, we see Dr. Dolen in the b.g.
looking over, but does not come into the records room or question
what's happening).</p>

<p align="center">RECORDS NURSE
Is there anything particular you're looking for?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
My associates did a biopsy on this man recently.
(thumbs through file)
He's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma,
some kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record
of it.</p>

<p align="center">RECORDS NURSE
(taking the file)
Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.
(searches)
Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles.
Tissue was benign.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
That's it?</p>

<p align="center">RECORDS NURSE
(shows him the file)
That's it.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
(reading it)
This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.</p>

<p align="center">RECORDS NURSE
I guess not.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
(very puzzled)
He'll be so relieved.</p>


<p align="left">60 EXT. SANTA MONICA
STREET - LATE AFTERNOON</p>

<p align="left">Fletch pulls up in
front of his building, a 1970's cinderblock apartment complex.
Fletch parks his car halfway up the curb, gets out and spots a
Mercedes coupe. He starts running toward the rear of his
building.</p>

<p align="left">61 EXT. REAR OF THE
BUILDING - DAY</p>

<p align="left">Fletch starts
climbing up the fire escape of his building.</p>

<p align="left">62 FIRE ESCAPE - DAY</p>

<p align="left">Fletch reaches the
second floor. He's huffing and puffing.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Christ.</p>

<p align="left">63 REVERSE</p>

<p align="left">Attorney Charles
Gillett is waiting for him on the second floor fire escape.
Gillett smiles.</p>

<p align="center">GILLETT
Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch.</p>

<p align="left">64 MASTER</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
What about breaking and entering?
(points to Gillett's coat)
Are you wearing anything under that?</p>

<p align="center">GILLETT
I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable
location to await my client's delinquent husband.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why don't we step
inside.</p>

<p align="left">Fletch takes out a
credit card and jimmies open the lock on the window.</p>

<p align="left">65 INT. FLETCH'S
APARTMENT - DAY</p>

<p align="left">Fletch climbs in
through the window, followed by Gillett. His small apartment is
just barely furnished. A low basketball hoop is attached to the
wall. Fletch takes a ball, offers it to Gillett.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
One on one?</p>

<p align="left">Gillett shakes his
head. Fletch does a reverse shot and misses, sending a plastic
globe lamb crashing to the floor.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
And the foul.</p>

<p align="left">Fletch takes a
second, successful shot.</p>

<p align="center">GILLETT
You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
(still playing b-ball)
She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. 
She's living with Monty. I know it.</p>

<p align="center">GILLETT
I don't know what you're referring to. 
Wendy maintains her own residence.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.</p>

<p align="center">GILLETT
Until she remarries, Fletch.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.</p>

<p align="center">GILLETT
I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However,
you threw her out.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
She was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV
guy. You can't get lower than that....</p>

<p align="center">GILLETT
You should have proved that in a court of law.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
My lawyer was a bum.</p>

<p align="center">GILLETT
(smiles)
I agree.</p>

<p align="left">Fletch puts down the
basketball, picks up a stack of mail and rifles through it.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I think he was sleeping with Wendy, too.</p>

<p align="center">GILLETT
You may be right.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Are you serious?</p>

<p align="center">GILLETT
(shrugs)
That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred
and eighteen dollars.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Wait a minute! Our problems might be solved.</p>

<p align="left">Fletch holds up an
envelope with Ed McMahon's picture on it.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
(continuing)
I think I just won a million dollars!</p>

<p align="left">He opens it and looks
inside, feigning disappointment.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
(continuing)
Damn...lost again. Sorry.</p>

<p align="center">GILLETT
This is no joke. If some kind of payment isn't made,
we're going to have to contact the paper and garnish your wages.</p>

<p align="left">Fletch sighs, takes
out the envelope given to him by Stanwyk. He hands a thousand
dollars to Gillett.</p>

<p align="center">GILLETT
Cash. I'm impressed.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Found it in a cab. That's a grand.
Apply the difference to next month.</p>

<p align="center">GILLETT
Till then.</p>

<p align="left">Gillett smiles and
exits.</p>

<p align="left">66 KITCHEN - DAY</p>

<p align="left">Fletch opens the
fridge. Inside are tow six-packs of Coors, a jar of Miracle Whip,
a half a cucumber, and a brown head of lettuce. Fletch takes a
beer and slams the door shut with such force that we hear
breakage inside.</p>

<p align="left">67 MASTER - APARTMENT
- DAY</p>

<p align="left">In a foul mood,
Fletch leaves the kitchen, and wanders into the living room. It
has the personality of an Abbey Rents.</p>

<p align="left">He picks up the TV
remote control. The television clicks on. Chick Hearn is with
Jabbar, during a Laker pregame warmup.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Thank God.</p>

<p align="left">Fletch settles back.</p>

<p align="left">68 TELEVISION</p>

<p align="left">Hearn is gushing over
Jabbar.</p>

<p align="left">69 FLETCH</p>

<p align="left">He watches
contemplatively. He is bone tired.</p>

<p align="left">70 TELIVISION</p>

<p align="center">HEARN
How about Fletch?</p>

<p align="center">JABBAR
Well, Fletch has been great. He's super-strong,
really clogs the middle for us, boxes out, 
gets the bounds....</p>

<p align="left">71 FLETCH</p>

<p align="left">He smiles and nods,
deep in fantasy.</p>

<p align="left">72 TELEVISION</p>

<p align="center">HEARN
Now here's a key play in Tuesday night's game....</p>

<p align="left">Hearn and Jabbar look
down at a television monitor.</p>

<p align="left">73 FLETCH</p>

<p align="left">He's half asleep.</p>

<p align="center">JABBAR (V.O.)
Here I am dishing off to Fletch....</p>

<p align="left">Fletch raises an
eyebrow.</p>

<p align="left">74 TELEVISION</p>

<p align="left">There's Fletch, his
hair in an Afro, dressed in Laker gold. He's on the receiving end
of a Jabbar pass, making an easy layup.</p>

<p align="center">HEARN (V.O.)
Gosh, he makes it look so easy!</p>

<p align="left">75 FLETCH</p>

<p align="left">asleep, smiling.</p>

<p align="left">77 PRICATICE COURT -
DAY</p>

<p align="left">Gail Stanwyk is on
the other side of the net, loading tennis balls into the
automatic serve machine. She is in her late twenties and quite
attractive., but in a much more natural way than other women we
see here. She is good natured and effervescent. Fletch steps up
to the entrance of the court.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Gail Stanwyk!</p>

<p align="left">She looks up. He
enters the court with great delight.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
(continuing)
I haven't seen you since the wedding,
Jeez, you look great.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
(genuinely pleased)
I do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess
something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding.
I really don't have the faintest idea who you are.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Huh? No, not my wedding. Yours.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
Oh, mine! Thank God.
(furrows her brow)
Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it?
Are you a friend of Alan's?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
We used to fly together. I'm...John.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
(snaps her fingers in happy recognition)
John! You used to fly together!</p>

<p align="left">Her smile segues
right into an "I'm sorry, bit I give up" expression.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
John who?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
John Ultrarelamensky.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
(bursts out in laughter)
Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
It's Scotch-Rumanian.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
(still loading tennis balls)
That's a strange combination.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
So were my parents.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
Mind if I keep practicing? I need to work
on my ground stroke a little.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Please.</p>

<p align="left">As Mrs. Stanwyk
crosses to the other side of the net, a waiter approaches Fletch.</p>

<p align="center">WAITER
Excuse me sir. Are you a guest of the club?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Yes, I'm with the Underhills.</p>

<p align="center">WAITER
They just left, sir.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.</p>

<p align="center">WAITER
Would you care for a drink while you're waiting?
I can put it on the Underhill bill.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.</p>

<p align="center">WAITER
Very good sir.</p>

<p align="left">The Waiter leaves,
and Fletch watches as Mrs. Stanwyk tries to return the serving
machine's serves. She swings so goofily that she can't even get
the racket on the ball. She has clearly never taken a lesson in
her life, and it is doubtful if she will ever make contact with a
tennis ball in this century.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
Damn, I thought I had that one.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
You should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan?</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
What are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him.
And he's been so preoccupied.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Preoccupied with what?</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
Oh, personal stuff. Look! I hit one!</p>

<p align="left">Indeed, she has.
Strait up. She and Fletch crane their necks upward to follow it's
flight.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Good. Lobs are a very important part of the game.</p>

<p align="left">She completely misses
the next one.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Why do you keep doing this?</p>

<p align="center">MRS STANWYK
I love the outfits.</p>

<p align="center">The next one she
hits with the handle.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Try stepping into the ball with your left foot.</p>

<p align="left">He demonstrates a
swing. She puts on a determined face, makes an awkward step and
swings at the next ball, missing it completely, and letting the
racket fly.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
There, much better.</p>

<p align="left">Mrs. Stanwyk laughs
happily and dodges the machine-served balls to walk over to
Fletch. When she's almost up to him, she turns back to the
serving machine and points a finger at it, as if addressing a pet
dog.</p>

<p align="center">MRS STANWYK
Stay!
(to Fletch)
I must be having an off day. I'm really a fabulous player.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I have this effect on lots of women.</p>

<p align="center">MRS STANWYK
I bet you do.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into
him this morning and you know what I can't figure out?</p>

<p align="center">MRS STANWYK
(catching him in his lie)
Alan's in Utah.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
(after a beat)
I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.</p>

<p align="center">MRS STANWYK
Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to,
and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but
I'm also very married so you may as well forget --
You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
(thinks, then nods)
I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?</p>

<p align="center">MRS STANWYK
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies
who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
You are a rich woman.</p>

<p align="center">MRS STANWYK
See what I mean?</p>

<p align="left">She trots back to her
ball machine. Fletch calls after her.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
What's he doing in Utah?</p>

<p align="center">MRS STANWYK
None of your business, now go away.
You're throwing my game off.</p>

<p align="left">Fletch chuckles -- he
likes this woman -- and exits.</p>

OFFICE - DAY</p>

<p align="left">A Secretary is
serving coffee to Fletch (now dressed in a three piece suit) and
John Boyd, Gail Stanwyk's father. At seventy, he is probably
Chairman Emeritus now; no longer running the day-to-day
operations of the company, and thus somewhat grateful from the
company.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
(continuing)
...and said 'Sorry Mr. President, I 
thought it was Saturday.'</p>

<p align="left">Boyd Laughs.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I thought I was going to die.</p>

<p align="center">SECRETARY
Sugar, Mr. Poon?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Thank you.</p>

<p align="left">Fletch notices a
framed wedding photograph on the credenza behind Boyd. It is of
Alan and Gail Stanwyk, Alan beaming a $hit-eating grin and
holding a happy thumbs-up.</p>

<p align="left">Fletch waits as the
Secretary leaves the room, then begins speaking confidentially.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Okay.</p>

<p align="left">He opens his attache
case, allowing Boyd to see an airline ticket, a <u>Washington
Post</u>, and a file stenciled "Confidential/S.E.C. Use
only."</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
First of all, let me just reiterate that this is <u>not</u> a
formal
investigation. I'm not going through formal channels here,
because
if Alan Stanwyk is not involved in any improprieties, then nobody
has to know I was even ---</p>

<p align="center">BOYD
Alan Stanwyk is <u>not</u> involved in improprieties. Where
the hell does the S.E.C. come off ---</p>

<p align="left">Fletch is nodding
sympathetically and holds up a quieting hand. Boyd stops in
mid-tirade, and watches as Fletch reaches into his briefcase and
seemingly turns off a tape recorder.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Look. You know that and I know that, but somebody's bucking 
for a promotion. I think it's that bozo, Hanrahan, I can't be
sure.
Anyway, unless I go back there with something, you and your 
son-in-law are next week's scapegoats.</p>

<p align="center">BOYD
Unbelievable.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?</p>

<p align="center">BOYD
Utah?
(laughs)
Jesus Christ! First of all, Alan Stanwyk does not own one 
share of stock.The three million dollars for the ranch 
in Provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her 
personal holdings, not company holdings. Now if anybody
in DC wants to make something of that, bring 'em on. 
Until then, get the hell out of my face.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
(stands and closes briefcase)
God I admire you.</p>

Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little
more time. I think I'm really on to something here.</p>

<p align="center">WALKER
Your onto something. That's good. What?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I really don't want to spoil your surprise, Frank.
Why don't you read it tomorrow?</p>

<p align="left">Larry, knocks on the

<p align="center">WALKER
What do you want?</p>

<p align="left">Larry points to
Fletch.</p>

<p align="center">WALKER
Speak, don't point!</p>

<p align="center">LARRY
I need Fletch for a second.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
She needs me, Frank.</p>

<p align="left">Fletch turns to
Larry. Push to two shot.</p>

<p align="center">LARRY
Nothing on Gail Stanwyk, nothing on Jim Swarthout.
But I did ---</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
That's okay, Lar. I gotta put this on the back
burner for a while.</p>

<p align="left">Larry starts to exit.</p>

<p align="center">WALKER
Just give me a hint, all right?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
All right. Maybe there are some crooked
cops involved in all this.</p>

<p align="center">LARRY
(stopping in the doorway)
Did you say cops?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Yeah.</p>

<p align="center">LARRY
That's one thing I <u>did</u> find. It's from
Last month, so it was in the unsorted pile.</p>

<p align="left">She hands Fletch a
clipping.</p>

<p align="left">105 INSERT - CLIPPING</p>

<p align="left">It is an article and

<p align="center">FLETCH
Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada.
I'm sure you've seen pictures.</p>

<p align="center">WALKER
What about finding the source?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I have some ideas.</p>

<p align="center">WALKER
Who? Donnie and Marie?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy
you a shirt.</p>

revival show; a call in show -- "Hi, you're on the

penalty. As you know, Jesus was in favor of it --" Fletch
whistles and switches the radio off. He turns the car off the

<p align="center">FLETCH
Hi, Jim Swarthout, please. Oh, hello, my name
is Igor Stravinski and I'm looking for some ranch property.</p>

<p align="left">110 INT. SWARTHOUT

<p align="left">Jim Swarthout is a
rugged-looking man in his forties. He sits in the den/office of
his house talking on the phone, surrounded by pine-paneling,
property tract maps and wall-mounted animal heads.</p>

<p align="center">SWARTHOUT
Good, Mr. Starinski, what'd you have in mind?
(pause)
Uh huh. Oh are you a friend of Alan's?</p>

<p align="left">111 INT. FLETCH'S
MOTEL ROOM</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
No, I just heard some people at the club talking about the
property
you sold him, and the way it was described, three million sounded
like
a pretty good price.
(pause)
What?</p>

<p align="left">Fletch pauses again
to listen, flummoxed over what he has just heard.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Are you sure?
(pause)
Of course. I guess I was misinformed. Listen,
I'd love to come out and see you anyway.
When are you available?</p>

<p align="center">SWARTHOUT

<p align="left">113 INT. FLETCH'S

<p align="center">FLETCH
Tomorrow.</p>

<p align="left">Fletch hangs up, very
interested.</p>

<p align="left">114 OMITTED</p>


<p align="left">115 EXT. SWARTHOUT
REALTY - NIGHT</p>

<p align="left">Fletch stops his car
in front of the ranch-style house. A lighted sign in the yard
indicate that this is indeed Swarthout Realty, but the house is
dark; no one appears to be home. Somewhere in the yard a dog
barks viciously, frantically.</p>

<p align="left">116 DOG</p>

<p align="left">A killer Doberman is
tied up behind a chain link fence. At the sight of the intruding
Fletch, the dog's lip is practically over his nose, his fangs are
poised and gleaming.</p>

<p align="left">117 FLETCH</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
(getting out of his car)
What's your name fella? Fluff? Pom-pom?</p>

<p align="left">118 DOG</p>

<p align="left">completely bananas.</p>

<p align="left">119 FLETCH</p>

<p align="left">Fletch reaches the
front door and looks around. He rings the bell. The dog yowls
even louder. Fletch waits. And waits. He rings again. Satisfied
that no one is home, he tries the front door. Of course, it is
locked. He takes out a credit card, starts to jimmy the lock, and
actually seems to be making progress when his credit card snaps
in half.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Sh*t.</p>

<p align="left">He pockets the broken
credit card, steps back and looks over the house for another
possible point of entry.</p>

<p align="left">120 FLETCH'S POINT OF
VIEW - AN UPSTAIRS WINDOW</p>

<p align="left">Double-hung. Slightly
warped, so that the upper half does not exactly true with the
lower half.</p>

<p align="left">121 FLETCH</p>

<p align="left">looks around to see
how to climb up to it.</p>

<p align="left">122 MASTER</p>

<p align="left">There's only one way.
Climb up the side of the chain link fence which separates him
from the murderous dog. Fletch approaches it warily. The dog is
practically foaming. Fletch reaches out a hand to get a hold of
the fence, and the dog just about rips the fence apart.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
(in his best Barbara Woodhouse)
Sit-tuh!</p>

<p align="left">This has no effect,
so Fletch backs up a few yards, take a deep breath for courage
and makes a headlong running start for the fence, using his
momentum to get to the top before the dog eats him. He grabs hold
and scrambles wildly for the top. He makes it.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Roll over. Play dead. Good boy.</p>

<p align="left">Fletch now grabs hold
of the eave on the side of the house, and very carefully pulls
himself onto it. It's only about ten feet from there to the
vulnerable window, but the angle of the eave is rather steep, and
the going is treacherous. As he makes his way, he keeps a wary
eye on the dog who keeps leaping up, seemingly getting closer and
closer to taking a giant bite out of Fletch's backside.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
You any relation to Doctor Dolan?</p>

<p align="center">Now he's at the
window. He tries to open it, but despite it's warped appearance
from the ground, it is locked. Fletch looks at the lock and can't
believe it. He sighs. He shakes his head. He smashes the window
with his elbow.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I hate this.</p>

<p align="left">He climbs into the
darkened house, leaving the enraged dog to run furiously around
the fenced in yard that surrounds the house.</p>

<p align="left">123 INT SWARTHOUT'S
HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - NIGHT</p>

<p align="left">Fletch tiptoes though
the upstairs bedroom and down the stairs. From outside, he can
still hear the dog snarling and barking.</p>

<p align="left">124 INT. SWARTHOUT'S
HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS - NIGHT</p>

<p align="left">As Fletch passes
through the living room he sees the dog snarling at him through
the living room window.</p>

<p align="left">125 INT. SWARTHOUT'S
DEN - NIGHT</p>

<p align="left">Fletch enters and
looks around.</p>

<p align="left">The dog is now
outside the den window.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Make sure nobody comes in, okay?</p>

<p align="left">He goes to the file
cabinet and opens it.</p>

<p align="left">He flips through the
"S" section. "Stanwyk". He pulls it. He
thumbs through various documents until he finds what he's looking
for. A copy of a deed. He pulls it out.</p>

<p align="left">125-A INSERT - DEED -
CLOSE ON THE PURCHASE PRICE</p>

<p align="left">Three <u>Thousand</u>
Dollars.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH (O.S.)
So much for your three million dollar ranch.</p>

<p align="left">126 FLETCH</p>

<p align="left">takes out a tiny
document camera -- the kind spies use in the movies -- and loads
it fumblingly. Then he props the deed up on top of the file
cabinet, and moves a lamp into position to light it. Just as he
snaps his first shot, we hear a terrible crashing sound.</p>

<p align="left">127 WINDOW</p>

<p align="left">The murderous
Doberman has made a crashing leap right through the den window,
sending glass flying everywhere, and he streaks across the room
to rip Fletch into bite-sized shreds.</p>

<p align="left">128 MASTER</p>

<p align="left">Fletch bolts and the
dog flies into the file cabinet, knocking it over, scattering all
the files over the floor. Fletch dashes for the nearest door, and
runs through it just as the dog slams into it.</p>

<p align="left">129 INT. KITCHEN</p>

<p align="left">Fletch is now holed
up in the kitchen, panting to catch his breath, feeling the full
course of adrenaline pumping through his terrified veins. He sees
that he can get to his car by climbing through the window. But in
order to get to the window he has to let go of the door, and that
would allow the dog to get in.</p>

<p align="left">Looking around
frantically, holding the door shut against the furious slamming
of the dog, he reaches for and finally grabs a mop which he props
under the door knob, thus keeping the door shut. Letting go of
the door gingerly, he satisfies himself that the dog cannot get
in, and he makes his break for the window.</p>

<p align="left">He vaults up onto the
counter top and is just about to break the window when he sees
that the dog's continued efforts are about to result in opening
the door.</p>

<p align="left">Fletch knows he has
only seconds. Standing on top of the counter, he opens the door
of the restaurant-sized refrigerator next to him, and just as the
snarling dog bursts into the room Fletch starts hurling food at
it. A pot roast, sliced turkey with stuffing, a couple of filet
mignons. The dog is momentarily distracted. Fletch pours a large
bucket of cranberry sauce on the dog.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Suck on this Cujo!</p>

<p align="left">Then he dumps an
equally large bucket of mashed potatoes. With the dog temporarily
vision-impaired, Fletch bolts.</p>

<p align="left">130 EXT. SWARTHOUT
HOUSE - NIGHT</p>

<p align="left">Fletch runs as fast
as humanly possible towards his car, fishing for his keys as he
goes. The dog -- having shaken off the people-food from his
hateful face -- is seconds behind and closing.</p>

<p align="left">Fletch makes it to
his car, hops inside, and slams the door just as the dog leaps
furiously at the windshield.</p>

<p align="left">131 INT. FLETCH'S CAR</p>

<p align="left">Fletch makes it to
his car, huffing and puffing. The dog jumps across the closed
window, snarling and bug-eyed with hatred.</p>

<p align="left">Fletch smiles, waves
at the dog, and starts taking its picture with his little camera.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Gimme a smile! There you go...oh, that's a nice one...
(starting the car)
Everything's fine, now...go take a little nap....</p>

<p align="left">Fletch is ready to
pull out, but the dog is still leaping madly at the window.
Fletch points back to the house.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Look! Defenseless babies!</p>

<p align="left">The dog turns to look
and Fletch guns it.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
That dog is such an A**hole.</p>

<p align="left">132 EXT. FLETCH'S

halfway up on the curb, steps out carrying a small overnight bag.
He is unshaven and looks beat.</p>

<p align="left">Fletch comes down the
hall signing "Billie Jean" is an excruciating falsetto.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH

<p align="left">He opens the door to
his apartment and is immediately thrown to the ground.</p>

<p align="left">134 INT. APARTMENT</p>

<p align="left">Fletch is
spread-eagled on the floor. Two huge Cops are over him, one
holding a gun to his head, the other going through his clothes.</p>

<p align="center">COP #1

Oh, what's this?</p>

Oh Yeah?

You'll like the Chief. Nice man.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I hear he's mellowed a lot since he came out of the closet.</p>

<p align="center">SERGEANT
I find he gets real mellow after he hits somebody a lot.</p>

<p align="left">137 DOOR TO CHIEF'S
OFFICE - CHIEF'S OFFICE</p>

<p align="left">The cops open the
door, pull Fletch inside. Chief Cummings, looking like a modern
executive, looks up from his paperwork.</p>

<p align="center">COP #1
Here he is Chief.</p>

<p align="left">They roughly throw
Fletch into a chair. The Chief -- seemingly oblivious to this
brutality -- smiles sincerely.</p>

<p align="center">CUMMINGS
Easy fellas.
(To Fletch friendly)
Be with you in just a second.</p>

<p align="left">The two Cops leave.
As Chief Cummings continues with his paperwork Fletch looks
around the office, which is decorated tastefully -- no guns on
the wall, no American flags. On one wall there is a Matisse, and
on another, various photos of the Chief with local celebrities.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of 
Police help you?</p>

<p align="center">CUMMINGS

<p align="left">He suddenly kicks
Fletch's chair out from under him. Fletch falls to the floor.</p>

Your editor called me yesterday to respond to allegations
you're about to print about police involvement in narcotics
dealing.</p>

<p align="left">Fletch starts to get

back down.</p>

<p align="center">CUMMINGS
I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't

the way of my men.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
'Your men' might just be involved in all this.</p>

<p align="center">CUMMINGS
You idiot. Off the record, deep background:
I've got that beach crawling with undercover cops.</p>

<p align="left">Cummings picks Fletch
up, and holds him by the lapels.</p>

<p align="center">CUMMINGS
If you keep nosing around, you make the bad guys just 
a little bit more cautious. That makes my job harder.
And if you print your story this week, you might get 
some of my men killed. I can't let that happen, Mr. Fletch.</p>

<p align="left">He throws Fletch
against the wall of celebrity photos, some of which fall to the
floor.</p>

You go back to that goddamn beach, I swear to God I'll
make you regret it.</p>

Maybe I'm gonna blow your brains out.</p>

I'm no lawyer, but I do believe that's a violation of my rights.</p>

<p align="left">The Chief takes a
knife out of his pocket, holding it with a handkerchief.</p>

<p align="center">CUMMINGS
After I shoot you, I stick the knife in my arm, then
place it in your dead hand. Self-defense. We don't do this
very much anymore...but we have. Got rid of a lot of 
minorities that way.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I hate the beach. Wouldn't go there if you paid me.
Besides, I'm way overdue on my story about off-track
betting in the Himalayas. You don't think it's the mafia,

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
Uh...I'm just out of the shower.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Can I borrow your towel for a minute?</p>

<p align="left">She laughs a nervous
little laugh. There is a bit of sexual tension here.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I
didn't think...What do you want?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I ordered lunch.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
You ordered it here?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
Down boy.</p>

<p align="left">With a nervous glance
in both directions, she lets him in and closes the door behind
them.</p>

<p align="left">157 INT. CABANA</p>

<p align="left">They stand there for
a few seconds looking at each other.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
I really should change.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
No, I think you should stay the same wonderful
person you are today.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
I mean put clothes on.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Here, take mine.</p>

<p align="left">He starts to take off
his shirt. She is amused, and responds playfully, but firmly.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
Stop that!</p>

<p align="left">He does.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Yes.</p>

<p align="left">She stands there,
looking around, trying to act as if her heartbeat weren't
speeding up.</p>

<p align="left">SFX: Knock at door.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Lunch....</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
God....</p>

<p align="left">She goes sprinting
into the bathroom.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Come on in.</p>

<p align="left">The door opens. A
second Waiter, Mexican, solemnly wheels in a cart bearing the
goodies ordered by Fletch. The twin bottle of Dom Perignon juts
from a silver ice bucket.</p>

<p align="center">WAITER
You want I set up?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.</p>

<p align="center">WAITER
<u>Muchas gracias.</u></p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Sierra del fuego.</p>

<p align="left">The waiter bows,
leaves, shuts the door. Mrs. Stanwyk scampers back in, gazes at
the cart as Fletch takes a bottle of Dom Perignon and pops the
cork.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
All this goes on Underhill's bill?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
(offering her a glass)
I saved his life during the war.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
You were in the war?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
No. <u>He</u> was. I got him out.</p>

<p align="left">She laughs and sighs,
knowing she's getting into something she probaly shouldn't.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
I can't believe I'm doing this. Well, lets eat.</p>

<p align="left">She tucks a napkin in
her towel like a bib and sits at the table.</p>

<p align="left">The Underhills have

<p align="center">WAITER
Your guest, sir.</p>

<p align="center">MR. UNDERHILL
We have no guest here today.
(reading the bill)
Two bottles of Dom Perignon, hundred bucks a pop. 
Jesus H. Christ! Where is he?</p>

<p align="center">WAITER
I believe he's with Mrs. Stanwyk.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. UNDERHILL
Gail Stanwyk. Tom, if he's with Gail Stanwyk ---</p>

<p align="center">MR. UNDERHILL
I don't care who he's with! This is criminal.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. UNDERHILL
Tom....</p>

'I've been so many places
in my life and times.
I've sung a lot of songs,

'I've acted out my life on stages,

Your bone structure, shoulders, neck....</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
'But we're alone now, 
and I'm singing this song for you.'</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
Just like Alan. It's freaky.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Can I ask you a question?</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
Depends on the question.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Are you still in love with Alan?</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
No.
(quickly)
I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.'
I mean, ask me something else.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Why'd you let me in?</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it.
I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let
you in because I'm hungry.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, 
why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Good point.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
Oh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look
what I say about it. Anyway, I know there'd be nothing
for me to do. I don't even know anybody there.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
What about his parents?</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
He never sees them and I never met them.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
How come?</p>

<p align="left">SFX: Insistent knock

Yes?</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
(sotto voice)
What is this?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Long story.</p>

<p align="center">MR. UNDERHILL

</b>Apparently, someone of your acquaintance has
charged the most extraordinary lunch to my bill.</p>

John!</p>

the lunch table towards the bathroom.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
You don't know the Underhills?</p>

<p align="center">MR. UNDERHILL

into the bathroom.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Take one end.</p>

<p align="left">Mrs. Stanwyk lifts
one side of the cart. They lift it and put it up into the
bathtub. There's a window in the bathroom. Fletch opens it.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
I think you should call me Gail, now.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Gail. I hope this won't embarrass you in any way. I think
Underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
Why did you do it?</p>

<p align="left">Fletch shrugs,
smiles.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
A four hundred dollar lunch tab!</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Yeah.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
I'll cover it. You have any other surprises?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
(after a beat)
Yeah. My name's not John Ultramalensky and
I wasn't at your wedding.</p>

<p align="left">She stares at him.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
Who.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Irwin Fletcher. I write a newspaper column
under the name Jane Doe.</p>

<p align="left">A long beat.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
So?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
So, your husband hired me to kill him.
That's the truth.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
What are you talking about?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
That's what I want to know.</p>

<p align="left">161 EXT. CABANA</p>

again.</p>

Mrs. Stanwyk!</p>

<p align="left">162 INT. BATHROOM</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
In a minute!</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
He told me he was dying of cancer.
Not True. That ranch you thought you
were paying for in Utah? Not true.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
How do you know about that?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail.
I think he's involved in something
very big and very bad.</p>


<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
What does all this mean?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout?</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in ---</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
But I've seen the deed.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
You saw a forgery.</p>

<p align="left">He takes out his
photographs.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
That's the real deed.</p>

<p align="left">162-A INSERT - PHOTO

<p align="left">It's is so fuzzy,
shaky, and poorly framed that there's no way we can read the

<p align="center">FLETCH
Here's this dog that tried to eat me.
Here's my motel. Here's the car I rented....</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
Stop it.
(angry and concerned)
Are you saying my husband is defrauding me?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I don't know. All I know is that he told me a lot
of things and so far not one of them has been true.</p>

<p align="left">Mrs. Stanwyk stares
at Fletch. She gets a little teary.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I'm really sorry I have to tell you all this.</p>

</b>Mrs. Stanwyk?</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK

Just wait, all right?!?
(to Fletch)
I'm going to call my father. He'll know what ---</p>

<p align="left">Fletch stops her.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
No. You can't. Look, I know you don't know me from
Adam, but you've got to trust me.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but
I'm not a complete Bozo, you know.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Just give me twenty-four hours. Please. Someone
almost killed me today. People are not being nice
lately, and I don't want you getting hurt. I think you're
terrific. Are you a Laker fan?</p>

<p align="left">Gail is now teary,
confused, and scared.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
No...I've got to go to Mr. Underhill....</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I'll take you to a game.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
What are you talking about?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you 
to a Laker game.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
Wait a second. What am I supposed to do 
for twenty-four hours?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
(climbing out window)
Act natural.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
I was afraid you'd say that.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
If you need me, call the paper. Hand
me that extra bottle okay?</p>

<p align="left">163 EXT. CABANA</p>

<p align="left">Gail opens the door
where Mr. Underhill has been waiting.</p>

the parking lot of a drug store/dry cleaning complex. The cop

done it long ago?</p>

<p align="left">one cop raises his
gun towards Fletch, but the crowd is too close, too busy. Fletch
shakes his hand and slugs him so hard on the back that he falls
over into the crowd.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH

'For he's a jolly good fellow....'</p>

<p align="left">The crowd sings along
the rest of the verse. Fletch looks back to the kitchen entrance
at the police who are swallowed in a sea of congratulations and
singing. Fletch takes his time strolling out of the kitchen.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Hmm. It's just that there are some other people
from my office going on this trip and...is there
anyone in the seat next to me?</p>

<p align="left">The clerk checks the
computer.</p>

<p align="center">CLERK
Yes, there is. Cavanaugh.</p>

<p align="left">Fletch shakes his
head. He's never heard of him.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Never heard of him. Thanks anyway.</p>

<p align="center">CLERK
You mean her.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
What?</p>

<p align="center">CLERK
Sally Ann Cavanaugh. Oh wait, she couldn't work
in your office, she's not from around here.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Oh, thanks.</p>

<p align="left">Fletch walks off and
we follow him.</p>

<p align="center">CLERK
She's from Utah.</p>

<p align="left">A lower-middle-class
area, one that seems to be sliding fast -- the plans are
scraggly, the houses need paint.</p>

<p align="left">Fletch's rental pulls
up over the curb onto the sidewalk. Fletch gets out, checks a
piece of paper, and goes up the steps to a dark-shingled
two-story house.</p>

<p align="left">209 TOP OF STEPS</p>

<p align="left">Fletch looks at the
name over the doorbell.</p>

<p align="left">210 CARD</p>

<p align="left">written in smeared

<p align="left">211 FLETCH</p>

<p align="left">rings the doorbell.
It sounds like a fire alarm in the quiet. Nobody answers. Fletch
tries the door. It opens. Fletch hums the old "Dragnet"
theme.</p>

<p align="left">212 INT. HOUSE</p>

<p align="left">still humming the

<p align="left">The shelves are bare.
Furniture is in place.</p>

<p align="left">214 MASTER</p>

<p align="left">Fletch enters the
kitchen, and opens the refrigerator. Inside is a can of coffee,
and some vegetables. Fletch leaves the kitchen and heads for the
bedroom. We follow him as he enters the bedroom.</p>

<p align="left">215 INT. BEDROOM</p>

<p align="left">Fletch opens the
closet. It's bare. He pulls open the drawers. Nothing. Fletch
gets down and looks under the bed.</p>

<p align="center">VOICE
Who the hell are you?</p>

<p align="left">In his surprise,
Fletch bangs his head as he starts up.</p>

<p align="left">216 REVERSE</p>

<p align="left">At the door stands a
gruff-looking Man in a red and black hunter's jacket, overalls,
and a hat with earflaps. He holds a rifle.</p>

<p align="center">MAN
Get up.</p>

<p align="left">217 MASTER</p>

<p align="left">Fletch gets up.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
The door was unlocked.</p>

<p align="center">MAN
Lock's busted.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
No wonder.</p>

<p align="center">MAN
I work for the landlord. He told
me to watch out for the place.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I commend him on his choice.</p>

<p align="center">MAN
What?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I commend him on his choice</p>

<p align="left">The Man stares at
him, holding the gun. He's not the brightest guy in the world,
and Fletch has already caught on to that.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh.</p>

<p align="center">MAN
Who are you?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Don Corleone. I'm a cousin of Mrs. Cavanaugh's.</p>

<p align="left">The Man just stares
at Fletch. Fletch starts to move ever so slightly, testing his
freedom of movement.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Where is she?</p>

<p align="center">MAN
Moved out.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
She moved out?</p>

<p align="left">The Man nods and
cocks the weapon. Fletch stops his tentative movements and just
looks around the room</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything.</p>

<p align="center">MAN
She moved out.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
So you're saying she moved out.</p>

<p align="center">MAN
This morning.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
This morning? Christ. We had so much to talk about.
Moe Green is out of the Tropicana, and my sons, Michael
and Fredo, are taking over.</p>

<p align="left">The Man continues to
gaze unblinkingly at Fletch, holding the rifle.</p>

<p align="center">MAN
What did you want under the bed?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Mattress police. There are no tags on the mattress.
I'm going to have to take you downtown. Please give
me your weapon.</p>

<p align="center">MAN
I'm calling the cops. This is for the cops.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I'm her cousin.</p>

<p align="center">MAN
Tell the cops.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Go ahead. Call them. Better tie
your shoelaces first.</p>

<p align="left">The man looks down at
his shoelaces. Fletch kicks the gun out of his hand and runs
through the house.</p>

the house and jumps into his car.</p>

<p align="left">219 INT. CAR</p>

rear window is suddenly blown away.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I'm getting real tired of all this hostility.</p>

out of the car and addresses the couple sitting on the porch of

They oughta recall these things. 
One bump,the whole window goes.</p>

<p align="left">221 PORCH</p>

<p align="left">Sitting on the porch
is a couple in their late sixties, whom we are about to learn are
Alan Stanwyk's parents -- Marvin and Velma.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
(approaching the steps)
Are you Mr. Marvin Stanwyk?</p>

<p align="left">Marvin nods</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I'm Harry S. Truman from Casewell Insurance Underwriters.</p>

<p align="center">MARVIN
(smiles)
Harry S. Truman?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
My parents were great fans of the former President.</p>

<p align="center">MARVIN
Isn't that nice. Good man. Showed the Japs a thing or two.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Sure did. Dropped the big one on them.</p>

<p align="center">MARVIN
Dropped two big ones. Real fighter.
You're in the insurance line, Harry?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Right.</p>

<p align="center">MARVIN
Well, I'm fully covered.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the
sub-insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by
Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son.</p>

<p align="center">MARVIN
Yes. Where you from, Harry?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route.
Can I ask you a few questions?</p>

<p align="center">MARVIN
Come on in.</p>

<p align="left">222 INT. MARVIN AND
VELMA'S LIVING ROOM</p>

<p align="left">Fletch and the
Stanwyks face each other on couches that flank the fireplace.
Fletch has a clipboard on which he will take notes.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
First, a couple of routine things:
are you and you wife currently alive?</p>

<p align="left">Marvin just stares at
him.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Regulations, Mr. Stanwyk. And you and your wife, named....</p>

<p align="center">MARVIN
Velma.</p>

<p align="left">Velma smiles.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Velma. You and Velma are the parents of Alan Stanwyk,
Beverly Hills, California, executive vice president
of Boyd Aviation?</p>

<p align="center">MARVIN
Check.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Okay.
(makes notation)
Now, the last time you saw your son was when?</p>

<p align="center">MARVIN
Oh, about ten days ago.</p>

<p align="left">Fletch is taken
aback.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Ten days ago?</p>

<p align="center">MARVIN
That's right. Alan comes by every three weeks or so.</p>

<p align="left">This is all news to
Fletch, but he covers his surprise.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Isn't that nice. Since when?</p>

<p align="center">MARVIN
Since he moved to L.A.</p>

<p align="left">Fletch is very
interested in all this.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Forgive me now for seeming personal, but we understand
that there is a lady friend he sees here in Provo.</p>

<p align="center">MARVIN
What the hell does this have to do with insurance?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.</p>

<p align="center">MARVIN
Well, you can forget about that lady friend business,
Alan's the most loyal husband a girl could have. He
dotes on that bride of his.</p>

<p align="center">VELMA
Cute young thing, too.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I'm sorry?</p>

<p align="center">VELMA
His bride. Cute as a button.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
You've met her?</p>

<p align="center">MARVIN
Well, of course we have. He brings her with him.</p>

<p align="left">Fletch is getting
very puzzled and very concerned about all this.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Has Alan ever mentioned the name Sally Ann Cavanaugh?</p>

<p align="left">Marvin and Velma
exchange the oddest of glances between them.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Has he?</p>

<p align="center">MARVIN
Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Then he has.</p>

<p align="center">MARVIN
Course he has. That's his wife.</p>

<p align="left">You could knock
Fletch over with a straw. Again, he quickly recovers.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Of course, his <u>wife's</u> name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?</p>

<p align="center">VELMA
Cute thing.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
(starting to sweat a little)
Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?</p>

<p align="center">VELMA
Oh, we've got lots of pictures. Let me show you some.</p>

<p align="left">Velma rummages
through a family album on a side table as Fletch tried to sort
all this out in his mind. She brings a photo over to him. He
looks at it.</p>

<p align="left">223 INSERT - PHOTO</p>

<p align="left">It's a wedding photo
of Alan and a woman we have not seen. She is brunette and quite
unlike Gail. Alan wears a similar sh*t-eating grin, and makes a
similar thumbs-up gesture to the wedding photo with Gail that
Fletch saw in Boyd's office.</p>

<p align="left">224 FLETCH</p>

<p align="left">He sighs.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
And they're still married...Alan and Sally Ann.</p>

<p align="center">MARVIN
Of course they are.</p>

<p align="center">VELMA
She's cute as a button.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
How long have they been married?</p>

<p align="center">MARVIN
Lets see, it was before he moved to L.A...four years April.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Mrs. Stanwyk, may I borrow this picture. I promise 
to send it back to you. It's routine, really. 
The actuarial people need to ---</p>

<p align="center">VELMA
Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the
reception?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
(rising)
No, thank you.</p>

<p align="center">VELMA
How about Marvin's sixty-fifth birthday party?</p>

Yeah...No kidding. The Marriott at LAX.
Sonofabitch...Checked in this morning. Great. 
Thanks a million. And call Gail Stanwyk at

What's wrong with my life?</p>

<p align="left">He starts it right
this time.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Question: Why does a man marry a millionaire's
daughter in Beverly Hills if he is already married
to a girl who lives in a crappy one bedroom apartment
in Utah? Answer: Three million dollars. Big Question:
What's with Stanwyk and Cummings? I don't know. 
Bigger Question: Why does Stanwyk want me to kill him?</p>

<p align="left">He takes a spoonful
of airline food, chewing meditatively.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH

Biggest Question: Why do I eat this sh*t?

Miss, I believe this has already been eaten.</p>

STANWYK'S CABANA - NIGHT</p>

<p align="left">Fletch knocks on the
door, and a tensely white-faced Mrs. Stanwyk quickly lets him in
and shuts the door behind him.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
I want you to know that dramatic phone
calls about secret meetings scare the
sh*t out of me.</p>

<p align="left">He can sense she is
unusually upset.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
What's wrong, Gail?</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
I decided I was going to tell my
husband about you today.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
No.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
But first I called the Hall of Records in Provo.
They checked on the deed. You're telling the truth.
A minute later Alan came in the room and asked me
why I was shaking.</p>

<p align="left">Fletch waits
anxiously to hear if she told Alan about him.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
So I told him...I told him I was
just cold or something.</p>

<p align="left">Fletch sighs with
relief.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
I've never lied to him before.
(chokes back a sob)
It's the first time he's ever lied to
me. He was just as convincing as when
he says 'I love you.'</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I think you better sit down.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
Oh God, I hate things that start like that....</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Gail, please.</p>

<p align="left">She sits in a chair.
he hands her the wedding photo.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I got this from Alan's parents. By
the way, they see him all the time.</p>

<p align="left">First she looks at
Fletch with puzzlement. Then, she looks at the photo and can't
seem to decide what to think of it. But she knows it's bad.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
What is this....</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I checked. There was no divorce.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I'm telling you he's not your husband at all.</p>

<p align="left">She is stunned.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
And they're leaving the country tomorrow night.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK

Bastard.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I don't have all the pieces yet, but
I'm close. I'll know tomorrow.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
I'm calling the police. Right now.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
You cant do that.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
Don't tell me I can't ---</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
They're trying to kill me!</p>

<p align="left">She is taken aback by
that, but there is a determination in her eyes.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
Your twenty-four hours are up, Fletch.</p>

<p align="left">She starts for the
phone, but he stops her.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
You're going to have to trust me, Gail.
You <u>have</u> to. Now listen to me: he's expecting
you to go to your meeting tomorrow night. Do it.
Stay out of the house.</p>

<p align="left">There is a long beat.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
I'm terrified.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Come here.</p>

<p align="left">He puts his arms
around her and holds her tight against him. After a few seconds

Cops are here. I can smell them.
They're after me. Lie down, Gum.</p>

<p align="left">Gummy lies back down.</p>

<p align="center">GUMMY
Why are they after you?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Because I'm a newspaper reporter and I'm nailing

He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he
just received the drugs. You did the selling.</p>

<p align="center">GUMMY
I didn't sell nothing! I didn't sell nothing!
I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam.</p>

For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the

You gonna nail the chief?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or ---</p>

<p align="center">FAT SAM
Oh, I'll help, Fletch. I'm a slave to that
sonofabitch. He busted me, third offense, gave me
a choice: Work for him or do fifteen long. All I get
out of this is free snort.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
You don't have a piece of the action?</p>

Noooo. Free snort. That's it.</p>

This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy.
(hands two sheets of paper to Walker)</p>

<p align="center">WALKER
What....</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Their statements, naming Chief Cummings as the numero
uno drug pusher from here to Oxnard. I want them to have
federal protection under the paper's sponsorship.</p>

<p align="left">Walker just stares at
the sheets.</p>

<p align="center">WALKER
Jesus H. Christ.
(smiles)
Fletch, this is the greatest.</p>

<p align="center">FAT SAM
He's some reporter, this guy.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I'm out, Frank. You lost faith in me.</p>

<p align="center">WALKER
Fletch, I got nervous. Please....</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Forget it.</p>

<p align="left">Fletch takes off his
robe and drops it to the floor. Beneath the robes he's wearing
cutoffs and a Bob McAdoo t-shirt.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I'm going to write the story. Just hold the last
couple of paragraphs till ten o'clock tonight.</p>

<p align="left">Fletch leaves the
office.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
(to Fat Sam and Gummy)
Make yourselves comfortable, guys, but 
don't leave the office.</p>

<p align="left">243 CORRIDOR</p>

<p align="left">Fletch heads for his
office. Walker follows.</p>

<p align="center">WALKER
Fletch!</p>

<p align="left">Fletch doesn't
answer.</p>

<p align="left">244 FLETCH'S OFFICE</p>

<p align="left">Fletch enters the
office and kicks his door closed. Walker opens it.</p>

<p align="center">WALKER
Fletch, you want an apology?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
You were going to can me, right?</p>

<p align="center">WALKER
(fumbles)
Not really.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Not <u>really?</u></p>

<p align="center">WALKER
I was upset.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I'm sick of this place. I'm going to try
out for the Lakers. They need a power forward.</p>

<p align="center">WALKER
Fletch.</p>

<p align="left">Fletch sits down and
turns on his word processor, ignoring Walker.</p>

<p align="left">245 EXT. STANWYK
HOUSE - NIGHT</p>

<p align="left">Fletch parks his Olds
halfway up on the sidewalk, and gets out. He climbs over the
gates of the Stanwyk home, and drops down inside. He lands on the
grass, trots around the shrubbery, heads toward the garage, and
checks his watch.</p>

<p align="left">246 WATCH</p>

<p align="left">It's five minutes
before eight.</p>

<p align="left">247 INT. STANWYK'S
GARAGE</p>

<p align="left">The jaguar is parked
just where it is supposed to be, and the key is in the ignition.
Fletch thinks for a moment and looks around. He sees a pile of
torn rags on the ground. He removes the key from the ignition and
opens the trunk.</p>

<p align="left">248 INT. TRUNK.</p>

<p align="left">Six large gasoline
cans and more rags.</p>

<p align="left">249 FLETCH</p>

<p align="left">Another piece of the
puzzle fits in place.</p>

<p align="left">250 EXT. HOUSE</p>

<p align="left">Fletch reaches the
rear of the house. He peers inside.</p>

<p align="left">251 FLETCH'S POINT OF
VIEW - STANWYK</p>

<p align="left">is in the library,
sitting patiently at his desk.</p>

<p align="left">252 FLETCH</p>

<p align="left">approaches the French
doors and enters.</p>

<p align="left">253
and OMITTED
254</p>

<p align="left">255 INT. LIBRARY</p>

<p align="left">Alan rises from his
desk to greet him. His hair is combed like Fletch's. We can see
that beneath his sports jacket he is wearing a Magic Johnson
t-shirt and jeans.</p>

<p align="center">MR. STANWYK
Good evening.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I like your outfit. You got the fifty
grand and the plane ticket?</p>

<p align="center">MR. STANWYK
Of course.</p>

<p align="left">Stanwyk nods toward a
small briefcase in the corner. Fletch eyes it quickly, and just
as quickly looks back at Stanwyk who just stands there by his
desk.</p>

<p align="center">MR. STANWYK
Why don't you check it out for yourself, Mr. Nugent?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
(smiles)
Because I trust you, Alan. By the way,
the name's Fletcher. I.M. Fletcher. I write
a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.</p>

<p align="center">MR. STANWYK
What?</p>

<p align="left">Fletch holds out an
envelope.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Read this, please.</p>

<p align="center">MR. STANWYK
Wait a second ---</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Cut the crap and read it.</p>

<p align="left">Stanwyk unfolds the
paper.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
(continuing)
Unless my people hear differently, this
letter goes out at midnight.</p>

<p align="left">256 INSERT LETTER</p>

<p align="left">We see that it is
addressed to:</p>

<p align="center">JOHN BOYD
<b>CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD
</b>BOYD AVIATION</p>

<p align="left">257 STANWYK</p>

<p align="center">MR. STANYK
(reading)
'Dear Sir: Alan Stanwyk murdered me
tonight. The charred remains found
by the police in the Jaguar are
mine, not his. Mr. Stanwyk, using
my name and passport, boarded Pan Am
Flight 306 for Rio, where he intends
to establish residence with ---'</p>

<p align="left">He stares at Fletch.</p>

<p align="left">258 FLETCH</p>

<p align="left">He is lifting
Stanwyk's two attachÃ© cases.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Pretty hefty. Keep reading.</p>

<p align="left">259 STANWYK</p>

<p align="center">MR. STANWYK
(reading)
'...with his legal wife, the former
Sally Ann Cavanaugh.'</p>

<p align="left">Stanwyk stops. He's
stunned, and not about to read anymore of this.</p>

<p align="center">GAIL'S VOICE (O.S.)
Keep reading, Alan.</p>

<p align="left">Stanwyk spins to the
doorway.</p>

<p align="left">259-A GAIL STANWYK</p>

<p align="left">standing in the
doorway.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
Don't worry, I can take it.</p>

<p align="left">260 MASTER</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
You shouldn't be here.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
I want to hear this.</p>

<p align="left">Fletch takes the
letter from Alan.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
He doesn't read my stuff well.
(reads)
'Sally Ann and Alan were married four years ago
and never divorced, making Stanwyk a bigamist 
even in Utah. Stanwyk is also traveling with 
three million dollars in cash, the result of
Gail Stanwyk's conversion of Boyd Aviation stock.
Mrs. Stanwyk believed the money was to be used to
purchase property in Utah, but it wasn't; a fact
that can be confirmed by realtor James Swarthout
of Provo.'
(aside)
That was stupid, Alan.</p>

<p align="center">MR. STANWYK
I'd have been long gone.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Ahem.
(continues reading)
'Sally Ann can confirm all this when
the police pick her up at the Airport Marriott.'</p>

<p align="center">Mr. Stanwyk
blanches. Fletch continues.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
'By the way, Alan is a very big drug smuggler,
but you can read all about that in tomorrow's paper.
Sincerely yours, I.M. Fletcher. P.S. Have a nice day.'</p>

<p align="left">Alan mulls over all
this for a few seconds, then smiles wistfully.</p>

<p align="center">MR. STANWYK
Bravo, Mr. Fletcher.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
The thing that really tipped it off for me
was something your wife said to me while we
were in bed together.</p>

<p align="left">Stanwyk shoots a
surprised look at Gail. She returns it with an innocent shrug.</p>

<p align="center">MR. STANWYK
(to Fletch)
And what was that?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
How similar in build you and I are.
then I figured it. You bump me off,
throw me in the car, and burn me up.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
My God, Alan, you really are and a**hole, aren't you?</p>

<p align="left">Now it is Alan's turn
to shrug innocently.</p>

<p align="center">MR. STANWYK
Sorry, darling.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
You sonofabitch.</p>

<p align="center">MR. STANWYK
Yes, I suppose I am. But I'm not a <u>stupid</u> sonofabitch.</p>

<p align="left">Mr. Stanwyk reaches
into his desk and pulls out his gun, and levels it at Fletch.</p>

<p align="center">MR. STANWYK
I was already prepared to commit one murder. 
What makes you think I won't commit two?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Whoops.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
(her bravado deflated)
'Whoops?' What do you mean 'whoops?'
Don't say 'whoops.'</p>

<p align="center">MR. STANWYK
I mean, by the time your story gets published, I'll
be on the beach. I understand extradition from Rio is
very complicated. I'll bet for two murders it's even more so.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
That is a lighter, isn't it?</p>

<p align="left">Just then, the French
doors swing open, and Chief Cummings enters.</p>

<p align="center">CUMMINGS
Greetings, everyone.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
(dryly)
Thank God, the police.</p>


<p align="center">MR. STANWYK
What the hell are you doing here?</p>

<p align="center">CUMMINGS
Put the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them.</p>

<p align="left">Stanwyk lowers the
gun.</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
(to Fletch)
I thought you had this all figured
out. Good going 'Irwin.'</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Don't ever call me 'Irwin,' okay?</p>

<p align="center">MRS. STANWYK
(to Cummings)
I've got it all under control, 
Jerry. You can go now.</p>

<p align="center">CUMMINGS
(laughs)
Under control? You idiot. You
didn't know who he was?</p>

<p align="left">During the following
dialogues, Fletch starts nudging the fireplace's gas lighter jet
key with his foot.</p>

<p align="center">CUMMINGS
Fat Sam left the beach today. So did Gummy.
It began to occur to me that some things are
beginning to happen that maybe I should be aware of.</p>

<p align="center">MR. STANWYK
I said I'll take care of it. Now, a man of your position
shouldn't be a part of what's about to go down. So go
home and I'll call you tomorrow.</p>

<p align="center">CUMMINGS
What, 'long distance?' I couldn't help but hear
you say something about Rio, Alan. You're not 
leaving with the eight hundred thousand dollars
I staked you for the next load, are you?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Whoa. Well, you two obviously have a lot to talk
over, so we'll go catch the last ten minutes of <u>Dynasty.</u></p>

<p align="left">Fletch and Gail
actually start to leave, but Cummings draws his gun and fires
over their heads. They dive for the floor, landing on the side of
the fireplace. Fletch palms a Zippo lighter from his pocket.</p>

<p align="center">MR. STANWYK
Jerry, you're simply going to have to trust me.
I've got a foolproof way to get rid of this guy
and now you're jeopardizing everything.</p>

<p align="center">CUMMINGS
Your 'foolproof' way is going to land my a** on
the front page while you're basking in Rio.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
...with your money.</p>

<p align="left">Cummings turns his
head momentarily to consider what Fletch has said, and Stanwyk
takes advantage of the distraction to go for his gun. But he is
too slow. Cummings shoots once, striking Stanwyk in the chest,
killing him instantly.</p>

<p align="left">Gail screams in
horror. Cummings turns to Fletch.</p>

<p align="center">CUMMINGS
This one's going to be even more fun.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
(striking the Zippo)
Go ahead. Make my evening.</p>

<p align="left">Fletch hurls the
lighter into the fireplace, causing a great whoosh of flames.
Cummings throws his hands up in front of his face and Fletch
leaps at him, wrestling him to the ground. Cummings is the
stronger of the two, and just as he starts to gain dominance over
Fletch, Gail Stanwyk staggers to her feet, picks up her husband's
tennis racket in it's wooden brace, and slams it against
Cummings' head with all her might.</p>

<p align="left">The Chief is knocked
out.</p>

<p align="left">Fletch lies there,
panting, trying to catch his breath. He looks up at Gail, still
holding the racket, and staring at Alan's body. Fletch hustles
her out of the room.</p>

<p align="left">260-A HALLWAY</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I'm calling the police. Then I'm
leaving. You wait here for them.</p>

<p align="center">GAIL
Where are you going?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Away. I think it might take you a while to get 
your life back together. You don't need me around.
(indicates the library)
Don't go back in there.</p>

<p align="left">He starts to leave.
She calls after him.</p>

<p align="center">GAIL
(still holding the racket)
I really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
(smiles)
You sure did.</p>

<p align="left">Fletch exits.</p>

<p align="left">DISSOLVE TO</p>

<p align="left">261 EXT. RIO DE
JANEIRO - DAY</p>

<p align="left">With Sugarloaf
Mountain in the b.g., Fletch lies in a lounge chair, sipping an
exotic drink, watching the cavorting lovelies and playing his
battered Casio. This is obviously at some very expensive beach
club or hotel, as witnessed by the uniformed servant who brings a
telephone.</p>

<p align="center">WAITER
(Brazilian accent)
Your call is come through.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Far out.
(to the phone)
Larry? It's Fletch.
(pause, looks around)
Well, it's not 'Fat Sam's', but...any port in a storm.
(pause)
Oh, tell Frank I need a couple of months.
The fifty grand's lasting longer than I thought.</p>

<p align="left">He pauses again to
listen to Larry, but sees something O.S. that takes over his
attention. he doesn't wait for Larry to finish what she's saying.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
I gotta go, Lar.</p>

<p align="left">He hangs up and
stands. We see that Gail has just walked up to him. The way they
look at each other indicates they have not seen each other for
awhile, and her arrival is a surprise to Fletch.</p>

<p align="center">GAIL
John Ultramalensky, right?</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Right.</p>

<p align="center">GAIL
God, I haven't seen you since the wedding.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Gee, I must have been sh*t-faced at your wedding, I don't ---</p>

<p align="center">GAIL
Not mine, stupid. Yours.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
(big smile)
What are you doing here?</p>

<p align="left">They start walking
down the beach. We stay right with them.</p>

<p align="center">GAIL
I couldn't sit home and play the mournful 
widow anymore, and the police didn't need me,
so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, 
but the announcer talked to fast and I
couldn't understand a lot of what was 
happening, so I figured if I came
down here maybe you could explain the
rules to me, and besides, I missed you.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
No problem.</p>

<p align="left">He puts his arm
around her, as we watch them leave us behind and walk off down
the beach.</p>

<p align="center">FLETCH
Basketball, of course, was invented in France,
and is played with a large ball, two tongue 
depressors and a fish....</p>

<p align="left">Fletch ad-libs just
like Chevy Chase would as they walk further away down the beach
until we....</p>

<p align="left">FADE OUT</p>

<p align="center">THE END</p>
