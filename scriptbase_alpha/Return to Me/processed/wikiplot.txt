Bob and Elizabeth Rueland (David Duchovny and Joely Richardson) both work — Bob as an architect, Elizabeth as a zoologist — at Chicago's Lincoln Park Zoo.
Elizabeth is killed in a car accident, and her heart is transplanted to Grace Briggs (Minnie Driver), who has suffered from heart disease since the age of 14 and is near death.
The surgery is successful and Grace, an artist, is able to live a normal life for the first time.
She plans to make her first airplane trip to Italy to paint, and her friend Megan Dayton (Bonnie Hunt) encourages her to begin dating, although Grace is self-conscious about the long surgery scar on her chest.

A year later, Bob remains depressed but recognizes that he must resume his life, helped in part by an anonymous letter from Grace through the hospital thanking him for his wife's heart.
His friend, Charlie (David Allen Grier), organizes a blind date for him at a restaurant.
Bob finds he is more interested in the waitress — Grace, who is also the granddaughter of the restaurant's owner, Marty O'Reilly (Carroll O'Connor).
Bob and Grace begin to date; although they become close, Grace avoids telling Bob about her medical history.

Just before Grace tells Bob about her transplant, she finds her letter in his house.
Horrified by the discovery, Grace flees and tells Megan, who later explains the situation to her husband in six monosyllables: "Grace has Bob's dead wife's heart!"

When Grace meets Bob again, she tells him the truth.
He is stunned and leaves her.
Grace sadly goes to Europe alone, but Bob realizes that he needs to go after her, and the two reunite in Italy.
