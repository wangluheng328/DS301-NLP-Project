</p><p></p><p id="act">We sense this is someone's P.O.V.  The WHITE slowly disperses as hints
of BLUE SKY peek through.  We are DESCENDING through the CLOUDS as the
evening sunset weaves a blanket of orange and red hues over a LARGE CITY
which slowly comes INTO FOCUS.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Floating HIGH ABOVE the peaks and valleys of CHICAGO'S SKYLINE, as if
being mysteriously moved to a letter on a Ouija Board, WE ARE DRAWN to
an unfinished STEEL-FRAMED SKYSCRAPER.  The hum of the construction work
below fills our ears.  Gradually, WE CLOSE IN on a small yellow dot that
dances on one of the exposed beams... CLOSER STILL... Just as the
detailed creases of a yellow hard hat become evident, it tilts OUT OF
FRAME as the face of the MAN wearing it looks up into the sky.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BOB

</p><p></p><p id="act">This is Bob, BOB RUELAND; late thirties, a confident, handsome man, with

makes his way to the service elevator.

</p><p></p><p id="act">A young woman wearing a lab coat exits a side door of the glass enclosed
structure.  This is DR. KATHERINE RUELAND, early thirties, smart, regal,
perfect-posture-pretty.  Securing the lock on the door behind her, she
stops and looks through the glass at the large GORILLA.  Using sign
language, Katherine encourages the Gorilla to eat the food.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHARLIE
</p><p id="dia">See what this lady does for you, Sidney?

</p><p></p><p id="act">Katherine laughs and presses her hand against the glass. Sydney returns
the gesture, pressing his palm against hers.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHARLIE

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">KATHERINE
</p><p id="dia">I intend to.  Who're you bringing tonight?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHARLIE

</p><p></p><p id="slug">INT. BOB AND KATHERINE'S APARTMENT

</p><p></p><p id="act">An upscale old fashioned brownstone, with large rooms and hardwood
floors.  Scattered antique rugs...classy but comfortable.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Bob enters with their dog, "MEL", a yellow lab, unhooks the dog's leash
and slips out of his wet trench coat.  He's perfectly handsome in his
tuxedo.  Grabbing an old towel from the hat stand, he dries off Mel.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BOB
</p><p id="spkdir">(walking to the kitchen)
</p><p id="dia">I know you're hungry...

</p><p></p><p id="act">Mel follows Bob half way down the hall then turns back and sits at the
front door.  Bob leans back into the hall, watching Mel...

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BOB (cont'd)
</p><p id="dia">She'll be home any minute.

</p><p></p><p id="act">We hear an ELECTRIC CAN OPENER... Mel looks towards the kitchen -- but
he waits for Katherine.  We hear a SET OF KEYS in the door.  Mel's tail
starts a-wagging.  Katherine enters, Mel whimpers with delight.
Katherine immediately bends down to greet him.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">KATHERINE
</p><p id="spkdir">(dog talk)
</p><p id="dia">Hi, my baby, you're such a good boy.
</p><p id="spkdir">(Mel kisses her face)

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">KATHERINE
</p><p id="dia">Hey, honey.  It's pouring out.  You get my dress?

</p><p></p><p id="act">Bob comes down the hall out of the kitchen.  Katherine is taking off her
shoes.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BOB
</p><p id="dia">Yep, and I took Mel out.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">KATHERINE
</p><p id="spkdir">(looks up)
</p><p id="dia">In your Tux?
</p><p id="spkdir">(noticing)
</p><p id="dia">Your pant legs are soaked.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Bob disappears into the bathroom off the hall.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BOB
</p><p id="dia">Yeah.
</p><p id="spkdir">(he leans back with a blow dryer aimed at his ankles)
</p><p id="dia">Tell Mel to eat.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">KATHERINE
</p><p id="spkdir">(dog's right next to her)
</p><p id="dia">Mel honey, eat.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Mel immediately heads for the kitchen.  Katherine walks up to Bob,
watching him blow drying his pant legs.  She grabs his face and kisses
him.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">KATHERINE (cont'd)
</p><p id="dia">You're cute.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BOB
</p><p id="dia">You spend all day with an Ape, what do you expect?

</p><p></p><p id="act">Katherine smacks him on the butt.

</p><p></p><p id="right">CUT TO:
</p><p></p><p id="act">A BLACK SCREEN

</p><p></p><p id="act">We hear the sound of a SLIDE PROJECTOR.  CLICK-CLICK.

</p><p></p><p id="act">UP ON:

</p><p></p><p id="act">A SLIDE of a large GORILLA, eating a dish of pasta with his hands, FILLS
THE SCREEN.

</p><p></p><p id="act">We hear polite laughter, from a large group of people.  KATHERINE'S
VOICE, speaks softly into a microphone...

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">KATHERINE (V.O.)
</p><p id="dia">As you can see in this photo of Sydney, he is sometimes "too much" like
</p><p id="dia">man.

</p><p></p><p id="act">More laughter.  PULL OUT to reveal we are at...

</p><p></p><p id="slug">INT. AMBASSADOR HOTEL - BALLROOM - NIGHT

</p><p></p><p id="act">A black tie affair in full swing.  The annual "ARTS DINNER" (Animal's
Right to Survive) has once again attracted Chicago's "upper crust" and
young hopefuls.

</p><p></p><p id="act">CLICK-CLICK.  Another SLIDE, FILLS THE SCREEN.  This time, it is of
SYDNEY and BOB RUELAND.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">KATHERINE (V.O.)
</p><p id="dia">Over the last ten years, Sydney has become part of the family.  Here,
</p><p id="dia">he's showing his flash cards to my husband.  My husband is the one on

</p><p></p><p id="right">CUT TO:
</p><p></p><p id="act">THE AUDIENCE

</p><p></p><p id="act">BOB smiles at those around him.  One GENTLEMAN teasingly pats him on
the back.  Bob looks up at the stage to his wife, with a playful "thanks
a lot" look.

</p><p></p><p id="act">REVERSE ANGLE

</p><p></p><p id="act">KATHERINE, minus the lab coat, in a lovely black evening dress, smiles
affectionately at Bob.  She CLICKS on the next SLIDE.

</p><p></p><p id="act">On the large screen next to her, we now see a photograph showing the
small area that Sydney is forced to live in.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">KATHERINE
</p><p id="dia">Tonight, I was hoping I'd be able to announce that we've reached our
</p><p id="dia">financial goals for the expansion we so desperately need, but
</p><p id="dia">unfortunately, we were not awarded the grant.

</p><p></p><p id="act">A murmur of disgust and disappointment from the crowd.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">KATHERINE (cont'd)
</p><p id="dia">But with one more year of fund raising, along with the money we've
</p><p id="dia">raised here tonight, Lincoln Park Zoo will soon be able to expand the
</p><p id="dia">Primate House to triple its size.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Applause.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">KATHERINE (cont'd)
</p><p id="dia">And I assure you, my dear friend Sydney and his family are very excited
</p><p id="dia">for construction to begin.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Katherine CLICKS another SLIDE up onto the screen; SYDNEY and a group of
GORILLAS, all wearing hard hats.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Laughter from the crowd mixed with a sympathetic "ahhh".

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">KATHERINE (cont'd)
</p><p id="dia">Thank you all for your tremendous support.  Enjoy the evening.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Katherine receives a generous round of applause as she leaves the stage.
The last slide of Sydney still shines on the swaying screen.

</p><p></p><p id="act">A CONDUCTOR/M.C. steps up to the microphone.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CONDUCTOR
</p><p id="dia">Thank you, Dr. Rueland.  Now ladies and gentlemen, tonight's very

</p><p></p><p id="act">A YOUNG WOMAN lies in bed.  A well cared for plant blooms on the night
stand, behind it, a small easel holds a half finished watercolor.
Posters of famous European cities decorate the walls.  We get the sense
this room has been her home for a month or so.

</p><p></p><p id="act">The patient is GRACE BRIGGS, late twenties.  An attractive, shy and frail
woman.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Grace barely responds as her best friend, MEGAN DAYTON, seated in the

</p><p></p><p id="act">Megan checks a box.  Grace smiles.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Grace stirs a little.  Megan immediately gets up and leans over the bed
to hear anything Grace may say.

We see the great amount of effort it takes for Grace to drink the water.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MEGAN

her coat, closes her eyes, takes a deep breath and drops the letter into
the mailbox.  We see it is addressed to: DONOR LIAISON.
