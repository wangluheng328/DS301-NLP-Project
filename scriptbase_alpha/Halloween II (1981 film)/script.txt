HADDONFIELD,ILLINOIS
OCTOBER 31ST 1978
FADE IN: "Mr. Sandman" plays as the camera pans through trees to the front of the house that Laurie Strode is babysitting at. We cut into the house:
LAURIE
(to the kids:)
I want you to listen to me. I want you to go out the house, and down the street to the McKinsey's house,I want you to knock on their door. I want you to tell them to call the police and send them over here.Alright? Now do as I say. Go!
THE KIDS EXIT. LAURIE leans up against the doorframe. In the background we see the Shape rise.
THE KIDS run out of the house screaming. LOOMIS sees them . INSIDE: The shape comes at LAURIE and tries to strangle her. LOOMIS runs up the stairs and fires six bullets at MICHAEL, MICHAEL falls off the back balcony.
LAURIE
Was that the boogeyman?
LOOMIS
As a matter of fact...it was.
LOOMIS walks to the balcony to see that the shape has risen from his spot. LOOMIS runs outside, and feels the ground and finds blood. A neighbor comes out of his house.
NEIGHBOR
What's going on out here?
LOOMIS
Call the police! Tell the sheriff I shot him!
NEIGHBOR
Who?
LOOMIS
Tell him he's still on the loose!
NEIGHBOR
Is this some kind of joke? I've been trick or treated to death tonight!
LOOMIS
You don't know what death is!
THE CREDITS ROLL
A YARD-MICHAEL's POV, WE SEE trick or treaters going about their rounds, a dog barks...We see LOOMIS and the police car.
LOOMIS
I shot him six times! I shot him in the heart. I shot him six times!
BRACKET
He couldn't have gotten very far come on.
LOOMIS
(getting into the car)
I shot him six times! This guy he's not human!
THE CAR drives off. MICHAEL turns and sees a house with jack-o-lantern in it. An elderly woman is fixing a sandwich in the kitchen.
ELDERLY LADY
Do you want mayonaisse on your sandwhich? How bout mustard?
She walks in to see her husband asleep in his chair.
ELDERLY LADY
Are you asleep again?
MICHAEL walks in the back door and picks up the knife. The news plays on the TV, we see MICHAEL exit the house in the background. ELDERLY LADY goes for the knife and rubs blood on her hand and screams.
MICHAEL walks outside and sees a young girl come out of her house.
YOUNG GIRL
Mrs. Elron? Mr. Elrong? Are you OK? 
SHE walks back inside.
YOUNG GIRL
(on phone)
Someone was screaming next door. Mr. and Mrs. Elron. Yea, she's always screaming at him. Maybe he started beating her.
OTHER GIRL

YOUNG GIRL
They are gone.My father took my Aunt Ruby to Harden County and my mother's decided to go along.

YOUNG GIRL
I can hear the sirens coming. Do they know who it was?

BRACKET and LOOMIS are riding around in the patrol car.
BRACKET

BRACKET shines a big flashlight out the side window.
BRACKET
There's nothing.

BRACKET hangs up the RADIO
BRACKET
(to LOOMIS who is loading a gun)
Will you put that thing away! You couldn't have shot him six times!
LOOMIS
You think I'm lying, Sherif?
BRACKET
I think you missed him. No man could take six shots.
LOOMIS
I'm telling you this isn't a man. Look out slow down.
BRACKET
What?
LOOMIS
Over there. Look, look.
A guy with MICHAEL MYERS mask is walking slowly down the sidewalk.
BRACKET
Is that him?
LOOMIS
I don't know.
LOOMIS gets out of the car and runs to him.
LOOMIS
(to crowd in the way)
Move it! Get back!
LOOMIS cocks his gun as if to shoot the guy. BRACKET wrestles him for it.
BRACKET
Stop, don't shoot! Don't shoot!
THE guy in the mask looks back at them. He is hit by a car and plunges into the side of a truck and is burned in a fire.
BRACKET

NURSE
Laurie, how are you feeling?
LAURIE
Soar. What happened?
NURSE
You cracked a bone. You're lucky it wasn't a break. The doctor felt that he should wait till tomorrow to put the cast on. Get some rest. Come on Jimmy.
JIMMY starts to follow the NURSE out the door but changes his mind and closes the door behind her.
JIMMY
Could I get you something to drink?
LAURIE nods.
JIMMY
Maybe a Coke?
LAURIE
OK.
JIMMY
OK.
GUY comes in.
GUY
Jimmy we gotta go.
JIMMY
OK. (to LAURIE) I'll sneak out later.
NURSE
Visiting hours are over.
NEWS REPORTERS are swamped around The Myers House.
REPORTER
Moments ago police reported that Michael Myers, formerly of Haddonfield, fled the Smith's Grove Sanitarium last night was believed to have burned to death. Meanwhile, three bodies were discovered in the house directly behind me. Identification of the victims is being witheld.
POLICE CAR pulls into the driveway. LOOMIS, BRACKET, and COP come out and look at the body on the stretcher. It's Lynda
BRACKET
I have to go home and tell my wife before anyone else does.
COP
Go on home Lee, I'll take care of everything.
BRACKET
(to LOOMIS)
D--n you! What have you done?
LOOMIS
I haven't done anything.
BRACKET
YOU LET HIM OUT!
LOOMIS
I didn't let him out. I gave orders for him to be restrained.
COP
Now is there anything else we can do for you?
LOOMIS
If that wasn't Michael Myers burning in that car there are going to be a lot of other kids dead tonight.
COP
He's dead. I saw him.
LOOMIS
I want to believe you. But I can't stop him until I'm certain he's dead. 
COP
You talk about him like he's some sort of animal.
LOOMIS
He was my patient for fifteen years. He became an obsession with me until I realized that there wasn't neither consciance nor reason that he was even remotely human. An hour ago I fired six bullets into him and he just walked away. I am talking about the real possibility that he is still out there! Where'd they take the body.
COP
The Courier's office.
LOOMIS
Get Dennis to meet me there in half an hour.
On a nearby street, a man walks carrying a boom box. On the boombox the news plays.
REPORTER (V.O.)
...claims to have shot him six times at close range. Haddonfield police have no explanation to the suspect's disappearance. However, they do say that he will be captured soon.
Two girls walk to a car.
GIRL # 1
I can't believe it. Pin the tail on the dockey and bobbing for apples. Actually bobbing in water no less. I am never going to another halloween party as long as I live. Especially not at Stevie Matthis's house. And of course now I'm going to be late.
GIRL # 2
You gotta drive me home first.
GIRL #1
Oh Dorothy, I don't have time.
DOROTHY
Well you've got to.
GIRL #1
Oh, can't you ask Eddie Lee?
DOROTHY
He's in Russelville.
GIRL #1
Oh, it's five minutes to your house another five minutes back to the hospital. Mrs. Dowels is going to kill me.
DOROTHY
You promised me.
GIRL #1
I know I did.
The girls get into the car and drive off. The man with the boombox walks down the street.
REPORTER (V.O.)
There was one survivor. Seventeen year old Laurie Strode was found directly across the street from where the murders took place. The teenager was taken across town to Haddonfield Memorial Clinic.
The boy walks right in front of MICHAEL MYERS. "Halloween Theme" plays as MICHAEL walks down the street and takes a left down a street where a sign reads: Haddonfield Memorial Hospital.
At the Hospital-The girl's red car pulls into a parking spot. She gets out and walks inside.
We see MICHAEL MYERS in the rearview mirror.
In the Hospital staff lounge, JIMMY, GUY, and GIRL are watching the news. GUY
I sure could go for a pizza right now. Looks like a go--amn homecoming.
In the security room-the guard is too busy reading to notice MICHAEL MYERS walking across the lawn on the TV monitor. GIRL #1 knocks on the door and the GUARD buzzes her in.
GIRL #1
Thanks, Mr. Garris.
In staff lounge.
GIRL

GUY

GIRL

BUDD

GIRL gets up to leave.
GIRL #1 comes in.
BUDD
You're late.
GIRL #1
Yea I know I've got to get on the ward. Hi Jimmy.
JIMMY
Oh hi Cara.
CARA
See ya.
JIMMY walks down the hall, we see a door creak close as he passes it.WE follow someone's POV down stairs, down a hall, and into a room. We see CARA looking through the maternity ward and then going to talk to a nurse. We are looking through MICHAEL's POV.
NURSE
(to CARA)
You were late again tonight.
CARA
Just fifteen minutes.
NURSE
That could be the difference between life and death for one of those kids.
We see MICHAEL in the maternity ward in the background. 
CARA
You're right. I'm sorry.
NURSE
I don't want to hear any excuses. YOu're a good nurse Cara. I'd hate to loose you. But you've got to learn to be on time. Now let's go over this list.
LAURIE's room-JIMMY is talking to her.
JIMMY
They should have handled him more carefully.
LAURIE
Who?
JIMMY
Michael Myers.
LAURIE
Michael Myers?
JIMMY
Yea, he was the one that was after you.
LAURIE
From the Myers house? That little kid that killed his sister?
JIMMY
Yea.
LAURIE
But he's in the hospital somewhere.
JIMMY
He escaped last night.
LAURIE
How do you know?
JIMMY
It's all over the radio. Television too. It's on right now.
LAURIE
Why me? I mean, why me?
NURSE comes in.
NURSE
Times up Jimmy. Let's go.
JIMMY
OK ok.
JIMMY starts to exit.He starts to mouth that he'll be right back.
NURSE
No you won't! Visiting hours are definantly over.
JIMMY exits.
NURSE
Men can't live with them can't live without them. How's that shoulder feel?
LAURIE
Better.
NURSE
Good. We've been trying to get a hold of your parents. Dr. Misaar said that they were at the same party that he was but they're not there now and they're not home. Do you have any idea of where else they might be?
LAURIE
No.
NURSE
Well we'll just keep trying.
NURSE picks up the phone and we see that it's not working.
MICHAEL MYERS walks out of the power room.
NURSE
This is just great.Janet!
JANET
Yes.
NURSE
Go tell Mr. Garetts we're having trouble with the phones. Right now.
JANET
He's at the other end of the hall.
NURSE
Janet.
JANET
Yes Mrs. Alice.
JANET leaves.
LAURIE
What's wrong with the phones?
NURSE
Nothing for you to worry about. Just get some rest right now. I'll let you know as soon as we get a hold of your parents.
NURSE exits and closes the door. LAURIE picks up the phone. She puts it down. She hears a noise from the other side of the room.
Meanwhile, MR. GARETTS and JANET are in the hall.
MR. GARETTS
I'm going to go check the lines. You wait here I'll call you.(hands her radio)
JANET
I gotta get back on the floor!
MR. GARETTS
It'll take me five minutes.
JANET
But I don't even know how to use this thing!
MR. GARETTS exits. He flashes a flashlight on the power lines. He walks over and looks in a trashcan. He sees blood in it, and a cat jumps out at him suddenly knocking him over. He gets up and walks inside the power building. He slides the door open. He goes into another room.
MR. GARETTS
(to radio)
I think someone broke into this storm room.
ON the other side we see JANET holding a RADIO and we hear MR. GARETTS voice which is so muffled you can't understand him.
JANET
Mr. Garret! I can't hear you.
ON THE OTHER SIDE
MR. GARET
Drive down to the sherif's station right away. 
JANET messes with nobs on the radio. 
JANET
Mr. Garet, how do you work this thing?
GARET
Janet! 
We hear something fall in the next room. GARET opens a closet and boxes fall on top of him. He flashes his light around. He sees another closet, and removes the lock from it. He opens it and finds nothing. He closes it on the right side. And when he closees it on the left we see MICHAEL. MICHAEL slams a hammer down on his face.
JANET
Mr. Garet! Mr. Garet I've got to get back on the floor. Hello?
JANET leaves.
THE MORGUE-A sheet is moved off of the burned up trick-or-treaters body. LOOMIS and the COP examine it.
MAN
It's difficult. Even the gums are charred but look here.See here? No fillings. Young. maybe seventeen, eighteen.
LOOMIS
Michael Myers is 21.
MAN
Positive ID means we can't get to his dental records.
LOOMIS
It'll take hours!
MAN
There's no other way to know for sure. I'm sorry.
LOOMIS
We haven't got hours. Listen to me we've got to assume that Michael Myers is still alive.
BRACKET walks in.
COP
Everybody goes back out.
BRACKET
But we just closed it up.
COP
I want a sweep from Chestnut South to the bypass. I want every street, every house, every backyard.
BRACKET
OK. You got it.
BRACKET leaves.
LOOMIS
(to COP)
Thank you.
COP nods.
MYERS house-people are throwing bricks at the windows.
POLICE CAR pulls up.
COP
(on RADIO)
This is Hank. Send another vehicle to the Myers house.
LOOMIS
Just drive. One of their number was butchered this is the way. 
LOOMIS loads his gun. COP looks at him.
LOOMIS
Hightens my sense of security.
COP smiles.
They get out of the car and walk to the Myers House.
COP
Stop it! Knock it off.
COP
(to LOOMIS)
You know. Haddonfield was a pretty quiet town before tonight. The only gunshot you heard was to start off the race at the high school track.
LOOMIS
Well this night in '63 Michael Myers did murder his sister in that bedroom upstairs with a butcher's knife.
COP
I remember.
LOOMIS
On halloween.
COP
I was sixteen years old.
LOOMIS
His anniversary was tonight. He came back.
COP
After fifteen years.
LOOMIS
Micheal Myers was an extraordinary patient. There was a force inside him biding his time. He came acustomed to the inability and silence. In many ways he was the ideal patient he never talked he never cried he never moved. He just waited. The staff was unprepared they didn't know what he was.
COP
Did you know?
LOOMIS
Yea I knew.
Two boys approach the COP.
BOY #1
Mr. Hank?
COP
What is it Greg?
BOY #1
I'm worried about Ben Tramer he's not home yet.
BOY #2
And he left the party at ten.
COP
It's only a little after eleven boys.
BOY #1
He was real drunk.
LOOMIS
How old is he?
BOY #1
Seventeen. And he had this stupid mask on.
COP
Alright boys.
THE BOYS LEAVE.
LOOMIS
Seventeen. Wearing a mask. We should check his dental record.
BRACKET
There's a break in at the elementary school they're pretty sure that it's him.
LOOMIS
Come on.
The cops dash to their car.
HOSPITAL-CARA is in the hall-she hears the patient bell and it alarms her. She laughs and walks into a room with a stethoscope. She touches a patient and he pulls her on top of him. The patient is BUDD. She screams and he laughs.
BUDD
Ow my hand. You could have broken it.
CARA
I wish I had. I also could have used these on you (pulls out scissors). What an a**hole.
BUDD
Happy Halloween.
CARA
Budd, you ARE the biggest jerk I've ever met.
BUDD
But you love me.
CARA
Yea, I love you.
BUDD
Let's go down to the third room. This finger needs a little bit of therapy. 
CARA
I can't leave the kids right now.
BUDD
Why is everybody all worded out tonight. All this Michael Myers crap. I just- I just want-
BUDD and CARA kiss.
CARA
I suppose if we left the door open we could hear if someone was coming or if the kids started to cry. I got to check it out first.
BUDD
Fifteen minutes?
CARA
IF everything's ok.
BUDD
You're wasting time.
LAURIE's room. LAURIE is dreaming and reminiscing. She goes back to when she was a child talking to her mother.
YOUNG LAURIE
Why don't you ever tell me anything?
MOTHER
I told you. I'm NOT your mother.
YOUNG MICHAEL MYERS around nine years old is looking out a window. YOUNG LAURIE looks at him and he glares back at her. LAURIE wakes up and looks around and goes back to sleep.
THIRD ROOM-BUDD and CARA are in the whirlpool.
CARA
It's hot.
CARA and BUDD kiss.
In the other room MICHAEL turns up the heat all the way up. We see a sign that reads: HYDROTHERAPY POOL WATER TEMPERATURE NOT TO EXCEED 100 DEGREES F.
In the whirlpool BUDD and CARA stop kissing.
CARA
Who am I kidding. It's too hot in hear now, Budd. Why don't you go check.
BUDD
It's cold out there.
CARA
It can get cold in here.
BUDD
Gotcha.
BUDD gets out of the whirlpool and wraps a towel around his waist. He goes into the thermo room and starts to change the temperature.MICHAEL comes from behind him and strangels him. MICHAEL then goes to CARA and drown her by repeatedly forcing her head into the whirlpool.
THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL-HANK(who I previously referred to as COP), LOOMIS and BRACKET are looking at a broken window. They are being shown this by COP #2
COP #2
He got in here. (flashing his light on the spot) and over here. And here.(points to a crayon drawn picture of a family. The sister in the family has a butchered knife stabbed through the page.
LOOMIS
Sister.
HANK
Is that it?
COP #2
No. Here.
HANK
What's this?
COP #2
Gibberish.
LOOMIS
No.It's a county word. Samhain, it means the loft of the dead. The end of summer. The festival of Satan.
WOMAN #2 comes in.
WOMAN #2
Dr. Loomis?
LOOMIS
Yes?
WOMAN #2
I have to talk to you.
LOOMIS
I didn't recognize you. What are you doing here?
WOMAN #2
PRIVATE.
LOOMIS exits into the hall with WOMAN #2
WOMAN #2
Dr. Loomis, you've been ordered back to Smith's Grove.
LOOMIS
Ordered? He can't order me.
WOMAN #2
No, no...but the governor can. He spoke to Dr. Rogers personally a few hours ago.
LOOMIS
The Governor, well well...
WOMAN #2
Dr. Loomis this thing is all over the state. Patient escapes once, murders three teenagers. YOU shoot him with a gun he escapes again.
LOOMIS
Someone should have listened to me earlier.
WOMAN #2
I know. I'm sorry. Dr. Rogers is just afraid that this could jeapordize our whole rehabilitation program. He doesn't want anyone from the mental health department anywhere near Haddonfield.
LOOMIS
Why did he send you hear then?
WOMAN #2
In case you already found him...alive.
LOOMIS
Tell him you couldn't find me. Tell him anything. I can't leave Haddonfield now.
WOMAN #2
I'm afraid you don't have a choice . There's a marshall waiting for you outside. 
WOMAN #2 exits.
HOSPITAL-MICHAEL is walking down the hall. JIMMY comes into LAURIE's room.
JIMMY
Laurie...Listen um.. I know that you don't know me very well. But I just want you to know that we're not going to let anything happen to you. OK? Promise.
LAURIE stares forward her eyes do not move. JIMMY runs outside and brings a nurse in.
JANET runs down the hall and bangs on a door.
JANET
Dr. Mixtune!Dr. Mixtune! Dr. Mixtune (no answer). 
The shower is running, but no one is in it.
JANET walks into DOCTOR's office.
JANET
Doctor Mixture. It's an emergency. Dr. Mixture it's Laurie Strode. She's had a reaction to the medication. You better come quick! Dr. Mixture! 
JANET turns the chair around to reveal that DR. MIXTURE has a needle stuck in his eye and is dead. JANET chokes on her words. We see MICHAEL come behind her and stabs a needle through her eye. Of course, she's screaming during this entire scene.
LAURIE's ROOM
JIMMY
This is ridiculous. I'm going to go find Mrs. Dowells.
JIMMY leaves.
JIMMY runs down the hall and knocks on the door to the ladies lounge.
JIMMY
Mrs. Dowells?
JIMMY runs down the hall.
The NURSE #2 comes out of the room and hears the patient alarm. She goes down the hall and into another room, closing the door behind her.
In LAURIE's room, MICHAEl walks in with a knife. He stabs the bed repeatedly with a knife. He pulls the covers off to reveal a bunch of pillows.
Meanwhile, LAURIE is hobbling down the hall. MICHAEl walks out of LAURIE's room. LAURIE continues to walk down the hall. NURSE #2 walks back into LAURIE's room and finds it empty.
NURSE #2
Laurie? You OK?
NURSE #2 rushes out of the room. On TV Monitor we see LAURIE walking down the hall. We see MICHAEL walking out a door. LAURIE is walking slower and limping at best. LAURIE reaches for a phone and pulls it down next to her on the floor. MICHAEL walks down the hall. LAURIE sits the phone in her lap, picks it up. MICHAEL is right down the hall. LAURIE puts the phone down remembering that the lines were cut. LAURIE peaks out the door and sees nothing. LAURIE sits against the wall, closes the door and falls asleep.
OUTSIDE THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL- LOOMIS, HANK, and WOMAN #2 are walking to the police car.
LOOMIS
(to HANK)
Where are you going to look?
HANK
I don't know.
LOOMIS
Neither do I.
LOOMIS is escorted into a car by the MARSHALL. WOMAN #2 gets in and they drive off.
HOSPITAL
NURSE #2
Mr. Garet?!
NURSE #2 picks up GARET's hat. We see MICHAEL on TV monitor.
NURSE #2
Mr. Garet!?
NURSE #2 walks down hall that MICHAEL was just at.
NURSE #2
(opening a door)
Mr. Garet?
A hand comes on NURSE #2's shoulder. NURSE #2 jumps around to see JIMMY. NURSE #2 gasps.
JIMMY
Sorry. Budd's gone, Mrs. ALlison's gone. We need to find Laurie. Why don't you search the West Wing and if you don't find anybody I want you to get in your car and drive out to the sheriff's station. Alright?
NURSE #2
Alright.
We see MICHAEL's shadow in the background.
LAURIE is asleep on the floor. JIMMY searches a room.
JIMMY
Hello?
JIMMY looks into a window and finds NURSE dead, her blood sucked from her by a tube. JIMMY examines it for a minute. Then he walks away. But he slips on the blood and lies on the floor.
NURSE #2 runs out of the hospital and gets into her car. She cranks it, but it won't start. She tries several times but nothing happens. She gets out and sees that she has a flat tire. She runs to another car and sees that it is flat too. And so is the yellow bug over there. She runs inside and closes the door behind her. LAURIE slowly gets up and opens the door and starts to limp out the door. She starts to walk down the hall but hears NURSE #2.
NURSE #2
Laurie!Laurie, wait.
LAURIE keeps going.
NURSE #2
Wait, Laurie.
LAURIE turns around to see MICHAEL come out behind a door and stab NURSE #2 and drop her to the ground. LAURIE starts limping as fast as she can. She runs down a hall and turns. She is panting hard and knocking things over. She runs down stairs and through a door. She tries to open doors but they're locked. MICHAEL comes down the stairs. LAURIE goes into the boiler room. She feels behind her and sees GARETS hanging from the wall, she screams. MICHAEL comes at her and she climbs up on the boiler and goes through a window leading into a room of boxes just in time. She limps through the trash and outside.She runs to an elevator and presses the button MICHAEL starts to come at her. The elevator shifts from floors 2 to 1 to G MICHAEL comes across the corner. LAURIE gets in the elevator and presses the button the door closes on MICHAEL's knife. But MICHAEL looses his grip and the elevator goes to the ground floor. LAURIE runs out of the hospital limping. She looks for a hiding place or an escape. She opens a car and hides in the floorboard. She looks over the car outside and sees nothing. She goes back into the floorboard.
The MARSHALL's CAR
LOOMIS
You don't believe me now did you?
WOMAN #2
I'm sorry.
LOOMIS
Don't feel sorry for me. Feel sorry for that little town back there. 
WOMAN #2
Dr. Loomis, I think there's something else you should know.
LOOMIS
Did you see the blackboard back there at the Elementary school?
WOMAN #2
Yes?
LOOMIS
In order to please the gods, the druid priests held fire rituals. Prisoners of war, criminals, the insane, animals were burned alive. By observing the way they died the druids believed they could see elements of the future. 2000 years we've come no closer. Samhaid is not spirits, it's not goblins,ghosts or witches. It's the unconscious mind. We're all afraid of the darkness inside ourselves.
WOMAN #2
Dr. Loomis please listen to me. There's a file on Michael Myers that nobody knew about.
LOOMIS
I've seen everything.
WOMAN #2
No. It was hidden. Sealed by the court after his parents were killed. Now after the Governor heard what happened tonight, he authorized Dr. Rogers to open it. 
LOOMIS
What file?
WOMAN #2
It isn't fair. They should have allowed you to examine everything. That girl, that Strode girl, that's Michael Myer's sister. She was born 2 years before he was commited. Two years after her parents died and she was adopted by the Strodes. They requested that the records be sealed to protect the family.
LOOMIS
Can't you see what he's doing here? He killed one sister years ago and now he's trying to kill the other one. Tonight after I shot him where did they take her?
WOMAN #2
The clinic.
LOOMIS
Clinic where? (to MARSHALL)Do you know this area well?
MARSHALL
A little bit.
LOOMIS
Where's the hospital located?
WOMAN #2
Dr. Loomis we're on orders from the Governor.
MARSHALL
It's back around Seventeenth Street. 
LOOMIS
Turn this car around right now!
MARSHALL
I can't do that I've got orders.
LOOMIS pulls a gun out and puts it at MARSHALL's head.
WOMAN #2
Dr. LOOMIS!
MARSHALL
Doctor, you're getting yourself into a lot of trouble.
LOOMIS
What is it you fella's normally do? Fire a warning shot, right?
LOOMIS shoots the gun cracking a window. The car makes a U turn and heads for the hospital.
In the parking lot of the Hospital, LAURIE is still in her hiding spot. JIMMY comes into the car and sits down.
JIMMY tries to crank the car.
LAURIE
Jimmy!
JIMMY
(wounded badly)
It's alright. We're uh...we're going to get out of here. (tries the engine again)I think uh...
JIMMY's head falls on the steering wheel honking the horn. JIMMY is dead.
LAURIE pushes JIMMY off the horn. She tries the engine again. She exits the car and falls onto the hard pavement . She sees LOOMIS's car pull into the parking lot. She tries to crawl to them.
LOOMIS
I ought to handcuff you to the wheel but I have a feeling I'm going to need you in there. Can I trust you?
MARSHALL
Sure. What do I got to loose except my job.
MARSHALL,LOOMIS, and WOMAN #2 exit the car. LAURIE tries to crawl to them, her voice is quiet.
LAURIE
Help...me...help.
LOOMIS closes the door to the Hospital.
LAURIE
(screaming)
HELP ME!!
Inside: 
LOOMIS
(to MARSHALL)
You go check all the rooms in there.
(hands him a gun)
(to WOMAN #2)
You come with me and shut up.
OUTSIDE LAURIE is still trying to get up. She stands and limps slowly towards the building. She gets about half way when we see MICHAEL's head appear behind a buliding. LAURIE runs to the hospital door and bangs on it. MICHAEL is close behind her.
LAURIE
HELP! HELP! HELP! HELP! HLEP! PLEASE HELP! HELP!
MICHAEL MYERS is about 30 feet away from her. LAURIE continues banging on the doors.
LOOMIS runs to the door and opens it for LAURIE, and slams it on MICHAEL.
MICHAEL walks through the door. The glass shatters. LOOMIS shoots him four times. The MARSHALL comes out from down the hall. MICHAEL drops to the floor. MARSHALL leans down to touch MICHAEL.
LOOMIS
Stop!
MARSHALL
He's dead!
LOOMIS
No he's not. Look at him he's still breathing.
MARSHALL
OK
LOOMIS
(to WOMAN #2)
There's a two way radio outside in that car I want you to get on it and get some help down here!
MARSHALL
Now wait a minute. I'm the only one authorized to use that.
LOOMIS
(to WOMAN #2)
MOVE!
WOMAN 2 exits.
LOOMIS
(to LAURIE)
I'm sorry I left you. Are you alright?
MARSHALL leans down at MICHAEL.
LAURIE
Why won't he die?
MARSHALL leans down to pick the mask off of MICHAEL. 
LOOMIS
Get away from him!
MARSHALL
He stopped breathing.
MICHAEL gets up and slits MARSHALL's throat. MICHAEL walks towards LOOMIS and LAURIE. They run down a hall and into a room. They run into another room and see MICHAEL coming for them through the window. They run into another room.
Meanwhile, WOMAN #2 is on the radio.
WOMAN #2
Michael Myers is here get your a** over here now!
In the room, LAURIE is hiding in a dark corner.
LOOMIS sees MICHAEL coming. He tries to give LAURIE his gun.MICHAEL comes through the doors right outside.
LOOMIS
(giving her the gun)
COme on come on come on.
LAURIE
No.
LOOMIS
Take it!
MICHAEL's face appears in the doorway.
LOOMIS puts the gun down on the floor beside LAURIE. LOOMIS stands with a gun aimed at MICHAEL as he crashes through the wood doors. LOOMIS aims the gun directly at MICHAEL's face, but MICHAEL stabs LOOMIS in the stomach. lOOMIS falls back into a corner. The shape walks towards LAURIE.
LAURIE
Michael!
MICHAEL continues coming...
LAURIE
(raising the gun)
Michael stoP!
LAURIE fires two bullets grazing both of his eyes. blood runs from the holes in the mask MICHAEL puts his hands over hiseyes and slings his knife around aimlessly. LOOMIS gets up and turns on a tank of gas. LAURIE gets up and turns another tank of gas on. MICHAEL continues to stab the air, which is filling up with gas. LOOMIS turns on more gas.
LOOMIS
(to LAURIE)
Get out!
LAURIE doesn't move.
LOOMIS
GET OUT!!
LAURIE runs out the doorframe into the hall.
LOOMIS
It's time, MIchael!
LOOMIS lights a match and the whole room is torched. LAURIE runs and takes cover.
OUTSIDE, WOMAN #2 rushes inside. LAURIE sits against a water fountain she sees MICHAEL MYERS come out of the fire covered in fire. MICHAEL falls dead on the floor and begins burning.
OUTSIDE-hour or so later-fire department cops, and ambulance is there. LAURIE is being wheeled in a wheelchair to the ambulance.
HANK
(to BRACKET)
What's the count?
BRACKET
Ten...so far.
REPORTERS crowd around LAURIE.
LAURIE
Can I ride in front?
DRIVER
I'm sorry but we're going to have to put you in the back.
LAURIE is helped into the ambulance. The ambulance drives down the road.
We see LAURIE's tired and blank face as the song "Mr. Sandman" begins to play. We see MICHAEL's mask burning off.
FADE OUT
