</b><b>	"BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD DO AMERICA"
</b><b>	
</b>	by
<b>	
</b>	Mike Judge and Joe Stillman
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b>		The movie begins with scenes of people screaming in horror 
	and running down the streets of a big city. The ground shakes from 
	what seems like giant footsteps. There are pieces of building 
	debris falling everywhere, people getting crushed, power lines 
	coming down, etc. - complete pandemonium. It all looks very much 
	like a Japanese animated King-Kong or Godzilla movie. We hear the 
	footsteps getting closer and the ground shaking becomes more 
	intense - more debris falling. Then we see a HUGE BLACK TENNIS 
	SHOE come into frame and smash a National Guard truck. As we pan 
	up, we see the white socks, then the red shorts, the AC/DC T-
	shirt, then we hear the familiar, "Huh huh huh." - only it's a 
	huge sound...this is a THREE-HUNDRED FOOT TALL BUTT-HEAD. "Butt-
	Kong" continues his path of destruction - stomping on cars and 
	buildings and saying, "This is cool. Huh huh huh."
		Airplanes and tanks start firing at Butt-Head (Butt-Kong). 
	He looks irritated and says, "Cut it out butt-munch!" Butt-Head 
	swats at the planes, sending them crashing to the ground and 
	stomps on the tanks. Then, something catches his eye. Butt-Head 
	reaches into a skyscraper and picks up a nice looking woman - a 
	lot like the one from the King Kong movie. He looks down at her in 
	his hand and goes wide-eyed, "Whoa! Huh huh huh." The woman 
	screams in terror as Butt-Head looks down at her and tries a few 
	lame pick up lines. "Uuuuh...Hey baby. I'm like, pretty tall. Huh 
	huh huh." He swats down a helicopter that is circling his head, 
	"Dammit, I'm trying to score!" The helicopter goes down in flames. 
	We CUT TO some guys sitting on a tank firing at him. They notice 
	giant footsteps coming from the other direction and turn the tank 
	around. Through their binoculars we see a THREE-HUNDRED FOOT 
	BEAVIS coming from the horizon. The giant Beavis is even more 
	destructive than Butt-Kong (maybe he could be breathing fire). 
	Beavis starts trying to pick up on Butt-Head's woman. Butt-Head 
	puts the woman down and he and Beavis begin to go at it, leveling 
	the city with one of their stupid juvenile smack-fights.
		We CROSS-DISSOLVE from three-hundred foot Beavis shaking 
	Butt-Kong to Butt-Head asleep on the couch with Beavis shaking 
	him.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	INT.  B&amp;B'S HOME - DAY
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS (O.C.)
</b>			Butt-Head! Butt-Head! Hey, Butt-Head!
<b>	
</b>	Butt-Head is dead asleep on the couch. Beavis shakes him.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Butt-Head, wake up, wake up!
<b>	
</b>	Butt-Head comes around.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Dammit, Beavis, I was about to score.
			Huh huh.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Yeah, but check it out. It's gone!
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			What's gone?
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			The TV.
<b>	
</b>	Beavis is making STRANGE NOISES, in a state of shock.
<b>	
</b>	Butt-Head rubs his eyes and looks at the empty space where the TV 
	was.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Uuuuuuh, huh huh. Uuh,...
<b>	
</b>	Out the window, we see two YOUNG MEN carrying B&amp;B's TV into their 
	van.
<b>	
</b>	Still on the couch, Butt-Head looks over at the broken window. We 
	see a CROWBAR lying on the floor, and the front door left open.
<b>	
</b>	Butt-Head looks at the BROKEN WINDOW, at the CROWBAR, the OPEN 
	DOOR, then back at the EMPTY SPACE where the TV was. He does this 
	a couple of times - piecing it all together.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD (CONT.)
</b>			Whoa! I think I just figured something
			out Beavis.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			What?
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			This sucks.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Yeah, heh heh.
<b>	
</b>	Beavis is still in shock. They both stare at the empty space where 
	the TV was for a beat, not quite sure what to do.
<b>	
</b>	Beavis is SHAKING AND MAKING WEIRD NOISES. He presses buttons on 
	the remote a few times, as if it might help somehow.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			This sucks more than anything that
			has ever sucked before. We must find
			this butt-hole that took the TV.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	EXT.  CITY STREET - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	Bad neighborhood. 70's music blares.
<b>	
</b>	A fast driving car drives right at us and stops. Punks run in 
	fear. Beavis hops out of the driver's seat, wearing bell-bottoms, 
	chain jewelry and a 70's afro. Into a dramatic CLOSE-UP, he takes 
	off his glasses.
<b>	
</b><b>	FREEZE ON BEAVIS
</b><b>	
</b><b>					ANNOUNCER
</b>			Beavis!
<b>	
</b>	FRAME UNFREEZES. Beavis whips out a huge gun.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Freeze, butt-wipe!
<b>	
</b>	An attacker comes from one side. Beavis uses Judo. Another tosses 
	a knife. Beavis ducks, then shoots with two hands, police style.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	Swinger's pad. Totally 70's. A group of bikini'd girls on a 
	waterbed. Butt-Head approaches them. He wears a leisure suit, 
	collar way open. He plops down in the bed.
<b>	
</b><b>	FREEZE ON BUTT-HEAD
</b><b>	
</b><b>					ANNOUNCER
</b>			Butt-Head!
<b>	
</b>	FRAME UNFREEZES. The girls wrap their arms around him.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Huh huh huh. Come to Butt-Head, baby.
<b>	
</b><b>					ANNOUNCER
</b>			Star in...
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	MAIN TITLE - FULL FRAME
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	EXT.  CITY STREETS - DAY/NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	ACTION MONTAGE BEGINS. Styled like a 70's cop show opening.
<b>	
</b>	OPENING CREDITS to the movie appear just as cop show credits 
	would.
<b>	
</b>	Beavis does a Starsky and Hutch-style roll with a gun.
<b>	
</b>	Butt-Head slaps a pimp.
<b>	
</b>	Beavis drives, chasing a car.
<b>	
</b>	Butt-Head is slapped by a girl.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Huh huh huh. That was cool.
<b>	
</b>	Beavis and Butt-Head are in a warehouse shoot-out.
<b>	
</b>	A black police chief rises from a desk to yell at B&amp;B.
<b>	
</b>	B&amp;B dive for cover just before a building explodes.
<b>	
</b>	In CLOSE-UP, Beavis smiles for an ID shot.
<b>	
</b>	Butt-Head does the same.
<b>	
</b>	Beavis, in a rooftop fight, kicks his opponent over the edge.
<b>	
</b>	A beautiful woman, back to us, takes off her dress for Butt-Head. 
	FINAL OPENING CREDIT APPEARS. Butt-Head and the woman fall into 
	bed. Suddenly...
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	INT.  SCHOOL HALLWAY/DOOR TO A.V. ROOM - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	From inside, SOUND of equipment crashing.
<b>	
</b>	B&amp;B come out wheeling a TV on one of those carts. There are cables 
	attached to it still leading back into the A.V. room. As they push 
	the cart we hear more equipment falling.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Dammit, it's stuck.
<b>	
</b>	They give it one big push and it finally breaks free. We see that 
	the cables are tangled with cables from other TVs and VCRs, which 
	all come crashing to the ground.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD (CONT.)
</b>			Huh huh huh. That was cool.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Yeah, heh heh. Let's just wheel this
			thing back to the house.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	INT.  SCHOOL/ANOTHER HALLWAY - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	MR. VAN DRIESSEN stops B&amp;B.
<b>	
</b><b>					VAN DRIESSEN
</b>			Ah, excuse me boys. What's going on
			here?
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Uh, someone stole our TV.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Yeah. We're just gonna use this one.
			Get outta the way. Heh heh.
<b>	
</b><b>					VAN DRIESSEN
</b>			I'm afraid that TV belongs to the school.
			Mmmkay? You know, this could be a positive
			experience for you guys. There's a
			wonderful world out there when we discover
			we don't need TV to entertain us.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Huh huh huh. He said "anus."
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>					(to himself)
			Entert-ain...us...an-us...Oh yeah! Heh 
			heh. Anus. Heh heh.
<b>	
</b><b>					VAN DRIESSEN
</b>					(frustrated)
			Have you guys heard a word I've said?
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Yeah, "anus." Huh huh huh huh.
<b>	
</b><b>					VAN DRIESSEN
</b>			Look, guys, just take the TV back to the
			A.V. room right now. And try to be a little
			more open-minded. Mmkay?
<b>	
</b>	Van Driessen leaves. B&amp;B continue to wheel the cart home.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			What a dork. Huh huh.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Yeah, heh heh. He's a anus. Heh heh.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	EXT.  SCHOOL/STAIRWAY - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	B&amp;B arrive with the cart at the top of a stairway. They lamely 
	attempt to let it slowly down the steps. The cart is too top-heavy 
	and goes tumbling to the bottom of the stairs, shattering the TV.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Huh huh huh. That was cool.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			No it wasn't!
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Uh,...Oh yeah.
<b>	
</b>	B&amp;B stand at the top of the stairs looking down at the wrreckage. 
	PRINCIPAL McVICKER shows up by the TV.
<b>	
</b>					McVICKER
			Why.... You... You bastards... Ge...
			get out! You're suspended. One more
			screw up... and you're expelled.
<b>	
</b>	B&amp;B walk off laughing.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	EXT.  THE ANDERSON'S DRIVEWAY - DUSK
</b><b>	
</b>	B&amp;B walk up. There's a camper in the driveway.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Whoa, check it out Beavis. I didn't
			know Anderson had a Camper.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Yeah, heh heh. Maybe it has a TV.
			Heh heh. TV.
<b>	
</b>	B&amp;B walk up to the camper and start to open the door just as MARCY 
	ANDERSON opens it. (As usual, she doesn't recognize them.)
<b>	
</b><b>					MARCY
</b>			Oh, hello. Are you guys here to look
			at the refrigerator?
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Uh, no.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			We're here to look at the TV. Heh heh.
<b>	
</b><b>					MARCY
</b>			Oh, I didn't realize it was broken.
			Come on in.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Cool. Huh huh huh.
<b>	
</b>	B&amp;B walk into the camper. Marcy stays outside.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	EXT.  ANDERSON'S CAMPER - SAME TIME
</b><b>	
</b>	Tom is adjusting the trailer-hitch. Marcy watches.
<b>	
</b><b>					TOM
</b>			Well that oughtta hold her. Ya know,
			the most important thing you can have
			on a camper is a good propane regulator,
			and this here's the best one they make.
<b>	
</b><b>					MARCY
</b>			I sure hope we can get the 'fridge fixed
			before we leave.
<b>	
</b><b>					TOM
</b>			Now Marcy, we've been savin' for this trip
			our whole lives and we're gonna go come
			Hell or high water...
<b>	
</b>	Through the camper walls, we hear the faint sound of B&amp;B 
<b>	AIR/MOUTH-GUITARING "IRON MAN."
</b><b>	
</b><b>					TOM (CONT.)
</b>			What the hell is that noise?
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	INT.  ANDERSON'S CAMPER - DUSK
</b><b>	
</b>	B&amp;B watch a "Cops"-type show. Beavis gets up, goes to the 
	refrigerator and grabs a soda. The refrigerator is under the 
	counter on which the TV is sitting.
<b>	
</b>	Beavis takes a sip and then does a SPIT TAKE, SPRAYING SODA ALL 
<b>	OVER THE TOP OF THE TV.
</b><b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			AAAAAAGH!!! This crap is warm!
<b>	
</b>	ANGLE ON TV: The soda Beavis spit out drips into the inside of the 
	TV. We see smoke and hear SIZZLING AND SHORT CIRCUIT SFX. The TV 
	goes dead.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Beavis, you butt-hole! You broke it.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	EXT.  ANDERSON'S CAMPER - DUSK
</b><b>	
</b>	B&amp;B come out. Tom notices them.		
<b>	
</b><b>					TOM
</b>			Hey, what's goin' on here?

</b><b>					MARCY
</b>			They're here to fix the TV, Tom.
<b>	
</b><b>					TOM
</b>			The TV ain't broken.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Yeah it is. Huh huh huh.
<b>	
</b>	Tom adjusts his glasses as he looks at B&amp;B.
<b>	
</b>	TOM'S BLURRY P.O.V.: We see B&amp;B out of focus.
<b>	
</b><b>					TOM
</b>			Hey wait a minute. You two look kinda
			familiar. Ain't you them kids that've
			been whackin' off in my tool shed?
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS &amp; BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Huh huh huh huh huh.
<b>	
</b>	ANGLE ON BEAVIS: looking particularly guilty, eyes shifting back 
	and forth.
<b>	
</b>	B&amp;B walk off, leaving Tom wondering.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	EXT.  STREET IN A SEEDY PART OF TOWN - JUST BEFORE DAWN
</b><b>	
</b>	B&amp;B are having TV withdrawal. Butt-Head is bug-eyed. Beavis has 
	the shakes bad, arms folded like Dustin Hoffman in "Midnight 
	Cowboy."
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Nnnnooo. Oooooh nooooo.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			What's your problem Beavis?
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			I need TV now! Now! NNNNDAMMIT!!!
<b>	
</b>	Butt-Head stops short. He looks up. His face is bathed in a 
	golden, throbbing light.
<b>	
</b>	BUTT-HEAD'S P.O.V.: We see a flashing neon sign that says, "TV". 
	Pull back to show B&amp;B are standing outside the Elite Motel Lodge, 
	featuring "Color TV" and "Air-Cooled Rooms", with "Special Nap 
	Rates."
<b>	
</b>	B&amp;B stare up, as if at a god.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>					(crazed)
			Heh heh. TV. Heh Teee Veee.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	EXT.  MOTEL COURT - CONTINUOUS
</b><b>	
</b>	Butt-Head tries the first door. It's locked. He tries the second 
	door. It's locked. He tries the third door. It opens.
<b>	
</b>	B&amp;B's eyes bulge. Inside, PRINCIPAL McVICKER is lying across the 
	legs of an obvious prostitute, his pants pulled down. She SPANKS 
	him.
<b>	
</b>					McVICKER
			Please mmm... may I have another?!
<b>	
</b>	B&amp;B LAUGH. McVicker hears and looks up.
<b>	
</b>					McVICKER (CONT.)
			Beavis and Butt-Head! Y...y...you
			bastards.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Can we watch your TV?
<b>	
</b>					McVICKER
			Y... Y... You're expelled! Get out!
<b>	
</b>	Butt-Head closes the door, laughing, and starts to walk towards 
	the next door. The muffled sound of a SPANK can be heard followed 
	by McVicker asking for another.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Huh huh huh. That was cool.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Dammit! I need a TV now! We're missing
			everything!
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	INT.  MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b><b>	
</b>	The only light in the room is a flickering TV. Sitting on the bed, 
	talking on the phone is MUDDY. He's a tough, mean looking red-neck 
	- a Jack Ruby type.
<b>	
</b>	On the nightstand next to him is a three-quarter drunk bottle of 
	bourbon and a manila envelope. On his lap is a big gun.
<b>	
</b><b>					MUDDY
</b>			...Are you sure these guys can pull this
			off? It's gotta look like an accident...
<b>	
</b>	We hear a knock on the door and muffled B&amp;B laughs.
<b>	
</b><b>					MUDDY (CONT.)
</b>			Hold on a minute. That must be them now.
			I'll call you back. (Hangs up phone)...
			Come in!
<b>	
</b>	B&amp;B walk in. Muddy turns on the light.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>					(sounding suddenly sedated)
			Aaaah. TeeeVeeeee, heh heh.
<b>	
</b><b>					MUDDY
</b>			Yer late.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Why? Did we miss American Gladiators?
<b>	
</b>	MUDDY'S P.O.V.: B&amp;B are a drunken blur.
<b>	
</b><b>					MUDDY
</b>			Well, Earl said you guys were young, but
			jeez... Oh well, as long as you can get
			the job done. So what are your names?
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Uh, Butt-Head.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Beavis.
<b>	
</b><b>					MUDDY
</b>			That's alright. I'd rather not know your
			real names anyways. I'm Muddy. Look, I'm
			gonna get right to the point. I'll pay you
			ten grand plus expenses, all payable after
			you do her...
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>					(full of innuendo)
			Do her? Huh huh.
<b>	
</b><b>					MUDDY
</b>			That's right. I'm offering you ten grand
			plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?
<b>	
</b>	Butt-Head stares in shock.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Actually, we just wanna watch TV...
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your
			wife.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>					(trembling)
			Nnnnaah...We need to watch TV DAMMIT!!!
<b>	
</b>	Butt-Head SMACKS Beavis and pulls him aside.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Beavis, you butt-munch, this guy wants us
			to score with his wife. And he's gonna pay
			us. We can buy a new TV.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>					(to Muddy)
			Uh, huh huh... We'll do it, sir.
<b>	
</b><b>					MUDDY
</b>			Okay, then let's get down to business.
<b>	
</b>	ANGLE ON THE BED. Muddy slaps down a picture of DALLAS, his wife. 
	Leather clad, biker, beautiful.
<b>	
</b><b>					MUDDY (CONT.)
</b>			Here she is. Her name's Dallas. She ain't
			as sweet as she looks. She stole everything
			from me. Ya gotta watch out, 'cause she'll
			do you twice as fast as you'd do her.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Whoa, huh huh. Cool.
<b>	
</b>	Muddy plunks down PLANE TICKETS.
<b>	
</b><b>					MUDDY
</b>			She's holed up in a hotel room in Las
			Veags. Your flight leaves in a couple of
			hours. Now c'mon, I'll drive you to the
			airport.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Holed up. Huh huh huh. Holed.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Can we watch some TV first?
<b>	
</b>	Muddy picks up the gun and SHOOTS the TV.
<b>	
</b><b>					MUDDY
</b>			No.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	EXT.  CITY STREETS - MORNING
</b><b>	
</b>	Muddy driving his loud four-by-four like a maniac, drunk with 
	bloodshot eyes. B&amp;B are in the back seat. He eyes them through the 
	rearview. Meanwhile, a cat bounces off the windshield with a 
<b>	SHRIEK.
</b><b>	
</b><b>					MUDDY
</b>			One more thing. Mah wife's got this
			leather satchel. It's black, about this
			big. I need ya to bring it back. It's
			real important. Sentimental value... Any
			questions so far?
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
<b>	
</b><b>					MUDDY
</b>			She sure does.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			This is gonna be cool! Huh huh huh.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Yeah, heh heh. Boooooiiiing!!!
<b>	
</b><b>					MUDDY
</b>			Just make sure it looks like an 
			accident...
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>					(spastic)
			Yeah, heh heh. I think I just had an
			accident. Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.
<b>	
</b><b>					MUDDY
</b>			Huh huh. You guys are funny. Let's have
			a drink on it.
<b>	
</b>	Muddy swigs the last swallow from his bottle of bourbon.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	EXT.  AIRPORT - EARLY MORNING
</b><b>	
</b>	In an overhead view, the four-by-four screeches up to the gate, 
	fishtails to a stop, throwing B&amp;B onto the sidewalk, and peels 
	away.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			We're gonna get paid to score.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Yeah, heh heh, and then we're gonna
			get a big-screen TV! Heh heh.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Beavis, this is the greatest day of
			our lives. Huh huh huh.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	INT.  AIRPLANE - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	B&amp;B enter the plane. They sit down in the first two seats on the 
	right - in First Class. A flight attendant, DOLORIS approaches 
	them.
<b>	
</b><b>					DOLORIS
</b>			Hi. Can I help you find your seats?
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Uuh, nah. These seats are OK.
<b>	
</b><b>					DOLORIS
</b>			I think your tickets have you seated
			in row fourteen, coach. So why don't
			you just go ahead and move back, OK?
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			That's OK. Someone else can have those.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Yeah, it's not that important to me,
			really. Those seats are too small anyways.
<b>	
</b>	Doloris yanks them out of their seats and leads them down the 
	aisle.
<b>	
</b>	ANGLE DOWN AISLE in coach. Doloris stops by a row where an elderly 
	woman, MARTHA, sits by the window. Next to her: Two empty seats.
<b>	
</b><b>					DOLORIS
</b>			Here you are.
<b>	
</b>	She gestures to the seats and leaves. Beavis climbs in the middle, 
	Butt-Head in the aisle - still watching Doloris.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Hey Beavis. When she was leading us down
			here, huh huh, she touched my butt. Huh
			huh huh.
<b>	
</b>	Martha, her senses a bit dimmed from age, turns to B&amp;B.
<b>	
</b><b>					MARTHA
</b>			Hello there. Are you two heading for Las
			Vegas?
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Yeah, we're gonna score.
<b>	
</b><b>					MARTHA
</b>			I hope to score big there myself. I'm
			mostly going to be doing the slots.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Yeah, I'm hoping to do some sluts too. 
			Heh heh. Do they have lots of sluts in
			Las Vegas?
<b>	
</b><b>					MARTHA
</b>			Oh, there are so many slots you won't
			know where to begin.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Whoa! heh heh. Hey Butt-Head, this chick
			is pretty cool. She says there's gonna be
			tons of sluts in Las Vegas! Heh heh heh.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Cool. Huh huh huh.
<b>	
</b><b>					MARTHA
</b>			It's so nice to meet young men who are so
			well mannered.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Yeah, heh heh. I'm gonna have money, and a
			big-screen TV and sluts everywhere!
<b>	
</b><b>					MARTHA
</b>			Oh, that's nice.
<b>	
</b><b>					CAPTAIN'S VOICE (V.O.)
</b>					(through P.A.)
			Good morning. This is your captain
			speaking. Welcome aboard flight 151
			non-stop to Las Vegas. We ask that you
			turn your attention to the front of the
			cabin for pre-flight safety instructions.
<b>	
</b>	B&amp;B see Doloris, stepping nearby to demonstrate the seat belt.
<b>	
</b><b>					ATTENDANT'S VOICE
</b>			To fasten your seat belt, insert the free
			end into the coupling.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Insert. Huh huh huh.
<b>	
</b>	Doloris demonstrates. B&amp;B are dumbfounded. It's too complicated.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD (CONT.)
</b>			Uh...
<b>	
</b>	They struggle to make their seat belts fit, getting each other's 
	parts.
<b>	
</b><b>					TAMMY (O.C.)
</b>			Hi, I'm Tammy? Can I help you with that?
<b>	
</b>	Butt-Head looks up.
<b>	
</b>	From his P.O.V. we see a beautiful woman, TAMMY, smiling, her 
	hands reaching down. FALLING IN LOVE/HARP MUSIC STING plays.
<b>	
</b>	CLOSE on Butt-Head's lap as two female hands reach down and pull 
	one strap from between Butt-Head's legs.
<b>	
</b>	Butt-Head looks down at his lap as Tammy leans over him. A loud 
	CLICKING can be heard. Butt-Head stares blankly.
<b>	
</b><b>					TAMMY (CONT.)
</b>			There you go. You're all set.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>					(stunned)
			I love you.
<b>	
</b>	Suddenly Martha buckles Beavis' belt. Tammy goes.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Wait, I wanted her to do it.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Huh huh. Soon, she will be mine.
<b>	
</b><b>					CAPTAIN'S VOICE
</b>			Flight attendants, please prepare for
			take-off.
<b>	
</b>	The engines start to hum. The plane is rolling.
<b>	
</b>	Butt-Head struggles to get his seat belt off. He does everything 
	but pull the handle. Beavis goes white with fear.
<b>	
</b>	The plane starts to shake. The engines rumble. Beavis starts to 
	freak.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Hey wait a minute. What's going on?!
<b>	
</b>	Butt-Head bangs away at his seat belt. Beavis looks out the window 
	and realizes they're in the air.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS (CONT.)
</b>					(screams)
			Aaaagh! We're gonna die!!!!!
<b>	
</b><b>	ANGLE ON COUPLE IN FRONT OF B&amp;B:
</b><b>	
</b><b>					MAN
</b>			D'ya hear that? Something must be wrong!
<b>	
</b><b>					WOMAN
</b>			Oh my God!!!!!!!
<b>	
</b>	ANGLE ON CABIN, people start screaming. The plane quakes, lifting 
	up.
<b>	
</b>	ON BUTT-HEAD, furiously pulling:
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Dammit! Huh huh. That chick wants me.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Aggghg! We're gonna die! We're all
			gonna die!
<b>	
</b>	The plane arcs upward. Butt-Head finally gets the belt off as the 
	plane is in full thrust. He rises and goes tumbling backward down 
	the aisle.
<b>	
</b>	ON PEOPLE seeing Butt-Head flying, screaming in panic.
<b>	
</b>	In free fall:
<b>	
</b>	Butt-Head grabs the door to the hangable luggage. It all comes 
	tearing out.
<b>	
</b>	Butt-Head flies up, hitting several overhead luggage racks, which 
	open and spill their contents.
<b>	
</b>	Butt-Head lands in the galley, causing food to go flying and 
	coffee to pour freely.
<b>	
</b>	ON THE CABIN as the plane starts to level out. People stop their 
	screaming.
<b>	
</b>	ON BUTT-HEAD, underneath the rubble, poking his head out. He's 
	directly across from the flight attendant station where Tammy is 
	strapped in.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Uh, huh huh... could you, like, do that
			thing with my belt again?
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	INT.  PLANE - LATER
</b><b>	
</b>	All's in order. Flight attendants roll the beverage cart up the 
	aisle. People read, relaxed.
<b>	
</b>	ON BEAVIS AND MARTHA. Martha is showing pictures of her 
	grandchildren. Beavis is showing the picture of Dallas that Muddy 
	gave him.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			I'm probably going to make out with her
			first before we, you know, get down...
<b>	
</b><b>					MARTHA
</b>			You'll have to speak up son. I have this
			ringing in my ears. My doctor says it
			could be related to my heart
			palpitations. I've had two operations on
			my heart.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Really? I poop too much.
<b>	
</b><b>					MARTHA
</b>			Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Uh... No, (louder) I poop too much. Then
			I get tired.
<b>	
</b><b>					MARTHA
</b>			Well, if you find yourself getting tired,
			take a couple of these.
<b>	
</b>	She hands him a box of NoDrowz.
<b>	
</b><b>					MARTHA (CONT.)
</b>			They perk me right up.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Heh heh, thanks.
<b>	
</b>	He pours the contents into his hand and chews them like candy. 
	Then his eyes open wide.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS (CONT.)
</b>					(strange)
			Uh, tastes like crap. Heh heh. Mmmmm.
<b>	
</b>	Beavis starts wolfing them down.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	INT.  PLANE - A BIT LATER
</b><b>	
</b>	Tammy passes out meals from a rolling cart. She works with 
	Doloris. Butt-head stands behind Tammy, attempting to hit on her.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>					(to Tammy)
			So, uh huh huh, are you going to Las
			Vegas? Huh huh huh.
<b>	
</b>	Tammy ignores him and moves on, leaving Butt-Head there.
<b>	
</b>	ANGLE ON BUTT-HEAD, looking down at something.
<b>	
</b>	PAN DOWN to reveal he's looking at a BEER on a fat guy's tray. The 
	guy's asleep.
<b>	
</b>	Butt-head picks up the beer.
<b>	
</b>	ANGLE ON BEAVIS, nearby. The NoDrowz is starting to take effect. 
	Beavis starts shaking, babbling, staring cross-eyed at his fist, 
	etc. (pre-Cornholio stuff)
<b>	
</b>	Tammy reaches her next passenger.
<b>	
</b><b>					TAMMY
</b>			Hi, we're serving dinner. Our selections
			tonight are chicken piccata or seafood
			gumbo...
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS (O.S.)
</b>			Piccata? Piccata! Picattatta tatta!
<b>	
</b>	Tammy moves forward, leaving Butt-Head standing there. In the 
	background, we see Beavis starting to quake, on the verge of 
	Cornholio mode.
<b>	
</b><b>					PASSENGER
</b>			Does the gumbo have corn in it?
<b>	
</b>	ANGLE ON BEAVIS: Turned, facing the cabin, T-shirt pulled over his 
	head in full Cornholio mode.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			I am Cornholio! I need picatta for
			my bunghole!
<b>	
</b><b>					TAMMY
</b>			You'll have to wait your turn sir.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Are you threatening me? My bunghole
			will not wait!
<b>	
</b>	Beavis starts to wander down the aisle.
<b>	
</b>	ANGLE ON CURTAIN TO FIRST CLASS CABIN. Beavis enters. From the 
	other side, SOUND of screams. We hear several CALL BUTTONS being 
	pressed.
<b>	
</b>	ON BUTT-HEAD. He approaches Tammy from behind. She ignores him.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Uh, I got a beer. Want some? Huh huh.
<b>	
</b><b>	ANGLE INSIDE THE COCKPIT.
</b><b>	
</b>	The PILOTS are relaxed and settled in when the door to the cockpit 
	slams open. Beavis is in the doorway SCREAMING.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Bargarajjjaaaahhh!!! I am Cornholio!!
<b>	
</b>	The pilots SCREAM. The copilot jumps up so fast he causes coffee 
	to spill everywhere, including on the captain's lap. The captain 
	then jumps up, hitting the controls and SENDING THE PLANE INTO A 
<b>	NOSE-DIVE.
</b><b>	
</b><b>	ON BUTT-HEAD
</b><b>	
</b>	In the back of the plane standing next to Tammy. He starts to take 
	a sip of beer. The nose-dive of the plane causes Butt-Head to go 
<b>	FLYING TOWARDS THE FRONT OF THE PLANE.
</b><b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			AAAAAHHH!!! Huh huh. AAAAHHH!!!
<b>	
</b>	Butt-Head bounces all overthe plane and then gets tangled up in 
	the curtain that separates first class and coach. It tears off, 
	and he continues to fly forward.
<b>	
</b><b>	COCKPIT
</b><b>	
</b>	The captain is desperately trying to regain control of the plane.
<b>	
</b>	Butt-Head slams into the cockpit, landing on the control panel 
	facing the captain.
<b>	
</b><b>					CAPTAIN
</b>			Get the hell out of the cockpit!
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Huh huh, you said...
<b>	
</b><b>					CAPTAIN
</b><b>			NOW!!!
</b><b>	
</b>	The captain throws Butt-Head back behind him and pulls the plane 
	out of the dive.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	EXT.  LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - EARLY EVENING
</b><b>	
</b>	The plane lands.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	INT.  COCKPIT DOOR - EARLY EVENING
</b><b>	
</b>	The flight attendants, shaken, smile at a line of people 
	deplaning. The people are white with fear, some covered with 
	flecks of spilled food and other matter.
<b>	
</b><b>					ATTENDANTS
</b>			Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
<b>	
</b>	They grow silent and still as B&amp;B pass by. Beavis takes the T-
	shirt off his head, coming down from Cornholio.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Huh huh huh. That was cool.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	INT.  TERMINAL/ARRIVAL GATE - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Arriving passengers are greeted. A family is reunited. Two 
	businessmen walk up to limo drivers holding cards with their 
	names. A reunited couple hugs.
<b>	
</b>	B&amp;B look around in confusion.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Uh, huh huh, this is Las Vegas?
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Yeah, heh heh. I thought there'd be
			casinos and lights and stuff.
<b>	
</b>	People greet and walk away. The place starts to clear out.
<b>	
</b>	One limo driver is left standing. He wears sunglasses and holds a 
	sign that reads: Beavis and Butt-Head.
<b>	
</b>	B&amp;B look around. Except for the driver, they're alone.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS (CONT.)
</b>			Hey Butt-Head, why's that guy holding
			a sign?
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Uh... maybe he's blind... Huh huh, check
			this out.
<b>	
</b>	B&amp;B go up to him. Butt-Head turns around, drops his pants and 
	hangs a "B.A." at the guy.
<b>	
</b><b>					B&amp;B
</b>			Huh huh huh huh huh huh huh.
<b>	
</b><b>					DRIVER
</b>			Ah, excuse me. You wouldn't know where
			I can find these guys, would ya?
<b>	
</b>	He indicates the sign. Butt-Head turns around and pulls up his 
	pants. They look and try to read:
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>					(reads)
			Uh, B...A...U... No, uh, V...
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>					(reads)
			Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>					(realizes)
			Huh huh. This says Beavis.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			And Boot-Head.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			That's Butt-Head. Don't you get it,
			Beavis. These dudes have the same name as
			us.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Yeah, we should party.
<b>	
</b>	The limo driver rolls his eyes and walks away.
<b>	
</b><b>					DRIVER
</b>			This way, sirs.
<b>	
</b>	B&amp;B follow the driver away. Beavis looks around.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			So where's those guys?
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	EXT.  MUDDY'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	HARLAN and ROSS, the two dumb-looking rough-necks that stole B&amp;B's 
	TV are standing outside Muddy's motel room. Harlan knocks on the 
	door.
<b>	
</b><b>					ROSS
</b>			Where the hell is he?
<b>	
</b><b>					HARLAN
</b>			You sure this is the right place?
<b>	
</b>	Harlan looks through the window and sees the shattered TV. No 
	one's there.
<b>	
</b>	Muddy's four-by-four SQUEALS into the lot and skids to a stop next 
	to Harlan and Ross' van. Muddy gets out, looking really drunk now.
<b>	
</b><b>					HARLAN (CONT.)
</b>			You Muddy?
<b>	
</b><b>					MUDDY
</b>					(slurring)
			You the cops?
<b>	
</b><b>					ROSS
</b>			Uh, no. Earl sent us. You know, to take
			care of your wife...
<b>	
</b>	Muddy grabs Ross by the collar.
<b>	
</b><b>					MUDDY
</b>			What the hell?!... What about those other...
<b>	
</b><b>					ROSS
</b>			Huh?
<b>	
</b>	Muddy tosses Ross to the sidewalk and starts back to they four-by-
	four.
<b>	
</b><b>					MUDDY
</b>			Dammit!!! She did it to me again!!!
<b>	
</b><b>					HARLAN
</b>			Hey, I noticed your TV was broken. You
			wanna buy a new one?
<b>	
</b>	Muddy gets in the four-by-four and starts it.
<b>	
</b><b>					MUDDY

</b>		Note: I would like this to be a well-known band (Red Hot 
		Chili Peppers) doing their best imitation of a modern Las 
		Vegas lounge act. I think a song like "What Am I Gonna Do 
		With You" by Barry White or something obnoxious like 
		"Bicostal" by Peter Allan would be cool. Or maybe Sinatra's

<b>	
</b>	Butt-Head tries to open the second door, jiggling it.

</b>	Suddenly, the door opens. Someone reaches out and pulls B&amp;B

	The place is being surrounded by police and plain black cars.

</b>	Dallas enters, sees this sight, and shuts off the TV. She looms 
	over Butt-Head.
<b>

</b>			So, uh, huh huh. Are we gonna score now?

	An LED light blinks.

</b>	B&amp;B stare, frozen for a beat, then go running for the elevator.

</b>	B&amp;B stare at an exhibit, riveted. The nuns watch them. A recording 
	plays.
<b>	
</b><b>					RECORDING (V.O.)
</b>			Welcome to the Petrified Forest. The
			world's largest site of petrified wood.
<b>	
</b><b>					B&amp;B
</b>			Huh huh huh huh wood.
<b>	
</b>	The Mother Superior makes a signal the other nuns were waiting 
	for. They all rush back to the bus, leaving B&amp;B behind.
<b>	
</b><b>					RECORDING (V.O.)
</b>			You may wonder, how can wood get so hard?
<b>	
</b><b>					B&amp;B
</b>			Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
<b>	
</b>	Through the window, we see the bus drive away.
<b>	
</b>	ANGLE ON AN OLD RANGER behind a counter, looking at B&amp;B. He sees 
	their A.T.F. photo nearby and reaches for a phone.

<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Hey, where'd those chicks go?
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Uh... I think you scared them off.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			This sucks. What are we doing here?
			Weren't we suppost'a go to Washington and
			score or something?
<b>	
</b>	From the car, a tourist couple heads into the building.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>					(to couple)
			Uh, do you know where Washington is?
<b>	
</b><b>					TOURIST MAN
</b>			Yeah, 'bout 2000 miles that way.
<b>	
</b>	He points to the desert, then continues into the building.

</b>			Didn't see which way they went. Didn't see

</b>			This sucks. It's all hot and stuff.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			This desert is stupid. They need to put a

</b>			Yeah or like a Seven-Eleven or

<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Uh, probably like, another five minutes or

<b>	
</b>	ANGLE FROM OVERHEAD. Lost, alone, B&amp;B wobble like they haven't

</b>			I sure did. They were whackin' off in my

</b>	A BIT LATER. Agents swarm over Tom's camper, turning everything 
	upside, pulling out dishes, trashing everything.
<b>	
</b><b>					TOM
</b>					(furious)
			Now wait right there. You're dealing with
			a veteran of two foreign wars. They're the
			ones been whacking off. If I find anything
			broken in there, you and I are gonna

<b>	
</b>	An A.T.F. agent smashes the micro on the ground and sifts through 
	the pieces.
<b>	
</b>	Nearby, Flemming and Hurley watch.
<b>	
</b><b>					FLEMMING
</b>					(appalled)
			Masturbating in a man's camper! We're

<b>	
</b>	Agent Bork runs up to Flemming.
<b>

</b>			Chief - just came in! Two days ago,
			Express Airways had a disturbance by

<b>	
</b>	He holds up a police sketch of Cornholio. Flemming walks to a

</b><b>	
</b>	B&amp;B walk along in the scorching heat. Ahead of them they see a 
	DUMB GUY and a DUMBER GUY with motorcycles parked. They are trying

<b>	
</b><b>					DUMB GUY
</b>					(to B&amp;B)
			Uh, hey. One of you kids got a match?

</b><b>	INT.  B&amp;B'S HOME - DAY

</b>			She flies so gracefully,

			floating down to land.
			She proudly lifts her voice

			And soon her mate responds
			by singing... "Caw, Caw, Caw."
			Come with me, Lesbian Seagull.
			Settle down and rest with me...
<b>	
</b>	Suddenly dozens of A.T.F. agents crash into the room. The door 
	bashes in, knocking Van Driessen down hard and crushing his 
	guitar.
<b>	
</b>	Flemming enters. Behind him, McVicker.
<b>	
</b>					McVICKER
			Uh...uh...uh that's him. He's their
			teacher.
<b>	
</b><b>					VAN DRIESSEN
</b>			What's going on here?
<b>	
</b><b>					FLEMMING
</b>			I'll ask the questions. Are these your
			students?
<b>	
</b>	He shows a picture of B&amp;B.
<b>	
</b><b>					VAN DRIESSEN
</b>			I assume you're a government agent. I
			would think you would know there's
			something in this country called due
			process.
<b>	
</b><b>					FLEMMING
</b>			That's about the kind of talk I'd expect
			from the guy who taught these two. Take
			this scum away.
<b>	
</b><b>					VAN DRIESSEN
</b>			I believe I'm supposed to be read my
			Miranda Rights...
<b>	
</b>	An agent interrupts, punching Van Driessen in the gut. He's taken 
	away. Flemming turns menacingly to McVicker.
<b>	
</b>					McVICKER
			I...I...I always knew they were no good.
			I... I... I hate them!
<b>	
</b><b>					FLEMMING
</b>					(to McVicker)
			You've been harboring two criminal
			masterminds!
<b>	
</b>	Bork rushes up to Flemming with a paper.
<b>	
</b><b>					BORK
</b>			Chief, you know that guy whose camper they
			were whacking off in?
<b>	
</b><b>					FLEMMING
</b>					(appalled)
			Bork! You are a federal agent. You

			Never end a sentence with a preposition.
			Try again.
<b>	
</b><b>					BORK
</b>			Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose

</b><b>	EXT.  DESERT - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	B&amp;B and the Dumn abd Dumber Guys are sitting around a campfire. 
	The Dumb Guy looks like an older, more stupid, version of Butt-
	Head. The Dumber Guy is a couple of evolutionary scales down from 
	Beavis. Their relationship is an exaggerated version of B&amp;B's.
<b>	
</b>	Butt-Head is staring at the Dumb Guy in admiration. Beavis, like 
	the Dumber Guy, appears to be just staring at the fire, 
	hypnotized. Dumb Guy is eating spaghetti out of a can.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			You were a roadie for Motley Crue?
<b>	
</b><b>					DUMB GUY
</b>					(mouth full)
			Yup. Huh huh.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Fire.
<b>	
</b><b>					DUMB GUY
</b>			Here's another true story. About fifteen
			years ago, we stopped in this, uh, toilet,
			called Highland...
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Really? That's where we're from.
<b>	
</b><b>					DUMB GUY
</b>			Well, then you know what I'm talking
			about. Anyway, here's the story. I
			scored with these two chicks. True story.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			You scored with two chicks?!
<b>	
</b><b>					DUMB GUY
</b>					(spaghetti dribbling from mouth)
			Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.
<b>	
</b><b>					DUMBER GUY
</b>			Ih hih hih hih hih hih.
<b>	
</b>	Dumb Guy punches Dumber Guy in the head with a closed fist.
<b>	
</b><b>					DUMB GUY
</b>			Shut up, dumb-ass! You didn't score. I
			scored with both of them...
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Uh, do you think these two sluts still
			live in Highland? That would be cool.
<b>	
</b><b>					DUMB GUY
</b>					(after taking another big bite)
			Hey, you wanna see something really cool?
			Huh huh huh.
<b>	
</b>	Dumb Guy gets up, turns his butt towards the fire and starts to 
	drop his pants.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	EXT.  DESERT/LONG SHOT - CONTINUOUS
</b><b>	
</b>	The campfire is in the distance, middle of nowhere. A flatulant 
	sound is heard. Suddenly, a big beautiful purple and orange 
	fireball erupts, lighting up the sky.

	scorching.
<b>	
</b>	B&amp;B inch forward - spent, dehydrated, near death.
<b>	
</b>	ANGLE ON GROUND as B&amp;B collapse into frame. Butt-Head looks up at 
	the sun, squinting.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>					(barely alive)
			The sun sucks.
<b>	
</b>	A vulture picks at Beavis' shirt. Beavis SMACKS the vulture.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>					(to the vulture)
			Cut it out butt-hole!
<b>	
</b>	The vulture moves revealing a PEYOTE CACTUS. Beavis looks at it.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS (CONT.)
</b>			Hey Butt-Head, isn't there supposed to be
			like, water in cactuses?
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>					(semiconscious)
			Uh...
<b>	
</b>	Beavis takes a bite of the cactus, chews and then coughs.
<b>

			Hey Beavis, check it out.
<b>	
</b>	IN FRONT OF B&amp;B: Two vultures start humping.

	A.T.F. agent.
<b>	
</b><b>					MUDDY
</b>			No, I can't say I've seen 'em. I sure hope
			it's safe to drive around here.
<b>	
</b><b>					COP
</b>			Don't worry, sir. Just stick to the main
			roads. If they're around, they're probably
			hiding out in the desert.
<b>	
</b><b>					MUDDY
</b>			That's good to know, Officer.

</b>	Muddy takes off with a smile and turns off onto a side road.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	EXT.  DESERT - LATER
</b><b>	
</b>	B&amp;B barely crawling forward. Butt-Head stops, then Beavis. They're 
	barely able to talk.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Hey Butt-Head, are we gonna die?
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Uh, probably, huh huh...Whoa, I think my
			life is like, flashing in front of my
			eyes!
<b>	
</b>	BUTT-HEAD'S VISION. Through time-lapse dissolves we see him 
	sitting on his couch with Beavis, laughing like an idiot in the 
	exact same positions at age 2, 5, 7, 10, 13.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Whoa, my life is cool!
<b>	
</b><b>	TIGHT ON BEAVIS:
</b><b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Uh... I think I'm seeing something too.
			It's like a really long time ago...
<b>	
</b>	BEAVIS' VISION: Beavis as a sperm cell swimming through a uterus. 
	It's a sperm cell with the face of Beavis on it.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS/SPERM
</b>			Yeah, heh heh. This is gonna be cool.
<b>	
</b>	Beavis/Sperm swims over to the egg.
<b>	
</b>	With its own tail the Beavis/Sperm starts picking its nose.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS/SPERM (CONT.)
</b>			Hey, how's it goin'? Heh heh heh.
<b>	
</b>	Several other sperm charge in, knocking Beavis into the egg. His 
	conception looks like a dumb accident.
<b>	
</b><b>	BACK ON BEAVIS:
</b><b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Yeah, heh heh I scored.
<b>	
</b>	Animated bubbles appear around Beavis' head.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS (CONT.)
</b>			Hey Butt-Head, I'm starting to feel weird.
			I think I'm freaking out.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Huh? Huh huh.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Whoa, this is cool! Heh heh. It's like,
			everything looks all weird and...
<b>	
</b>	BEAVIS' P.O.V. OF BUTT-HEAD: His face starts to warp and colors 
	start shifting.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS (CONT.)
</b>			...and... Whoa!...and it's like there's
			all these weird shapes and it's sort of
			like,...it's like...like a MUSIC VIDEO!!!
<b>	
</b>	Tight on Beavis' face staring in wonder.
<b>	
</b>	THIS IS WHERE THE MUSIC VIDEO/HALLUCINATION SEQUENCE BEGINS. It 
	could even be so shameless as to actually have a chyron in the 
	lower left hand corner.
<b>	
</b>	I would like to have a band (White Zombie?) do a version of 
	something like, "Fire," by The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. This 
	is the song that begins, "I am God of Hellfire and I bring you... 
	fire!"
<b>	
</b>	The concept of this will depend somewhat on which band we get, but 
	I would like to see it get pretty wild and surreal. (If it's White 
	Zombie, we could incorporate some of Rob Zombie's artwork.)
<b>	
</b><b>	BEAVIS' P.O.V.:
</b><b>	
</b>	We see the sun above the horizon turn into a giant ball of fire. 
	The ball of fire develops a face and speaks.
<b>	
</b><b>					FIRE
</b>			I am God of Hellfire and I bring
			you...(music begins) Fire...
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Whoa!!! This kicks ass!!!
<b>	
</b>	THIS IS THE GREATEST VIDEO BEAVIS HAS EVER SEEN. Out of the ball 
	of fire steps a beautiful woman in a bikini.
<b>	
</b>	At first the video is mostly the God of Hellfire, chicks in 
	bikinis and various images of B&amp;B's TV in all its glory.
<b>	
</b>	As the video/hallucination continues, it becomes a psychotic mass 
	of naked people, fire, TVs, vultures, B&amp;B head-banging, weird 
	stuff from my high school notebooks, etc.
<b>	
</b>	At one point we see the God of Hellfire in a Burger World uniform.
<b>	
</b>	As the song winds down, we incorporate Muddy's car into the 
	surreal imagery. (We should also incorporate their TV, as well as 
	maybe some of the characters from the show that aren't in the 
	movie.)
<b>	
</b>	Then, we REVEAL Muddy's car actually pulling up to B&amp;B's near-dead 
	bodies.
<b>	
</b>	The SONG ENDS as Muddy tosses water on B&amp;B. REVEAL they were not 
	far from the side of a road all along.
<b>	
</b><b>					B&amp;B
</b>			Ahhhhghhhhgh!
<b>	
</b>	B&amp;B snap out of it. They rise and find Muddy hovering over them 
	with a shotgun.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Aagh! I'm all wet!...(realizing) Oh, cool.
			Heh heh heh. Water.
<b>	
</b>	Muddy aims his shotgun at B&amp;B.
<b>	
</b><b>					MUDDY
</b>			Ah'm gonna enjoy this. Any last words
			b'fore ah kill ya?
<b>	
</b>	B&amp;B think.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Uh... Huh huh. I have a couple. Butt
			cheeks, huh huh huh.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Yeah! Boobs. Heh heh. I just wanna say
			that again. Boobs. Heh heh.
<b>	
</b><b>					MUDDY
</b>			Ah'm gonna blow you both to hell!
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Cool, huh huh. (realizing) Hey Beavis
			that's that dude that's paying us to do
			his wife.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Oh yeah. Can you just take us to
			Washington? We're gonna meet her there
			and, you know, heh heh hmmm...
<b>	
</b><b>					MUDDY
</b>			Washington! That's where she was gonna
			meet up with ya? (realizes) Damn, she's
			goin' all the way!
<b>	
</b><b>					B&amp;B
</b>			Huh huh huh huh huh huh huh.
<b>	
</b>	Muddy lowers the gun a bit.
<b>	
</b><b>					MUDDY
</b>			You know, I just might need you after all.
			Aw right, in the trunk. You're gonna help
			me get mah unit back.
<b>	
</b>	Muddy pops it open. B&amp;B climb in. Muddy closes the trunk on them 
	and walks to the front of the car. HOLD ON THE TRUNK.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD (O.S.)
</b>			Boy, it sure is hard to score. Huh huh
			huh.

</b>			Huh huh huh huh huh huh.

<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			This sucks. Let's get outta here.
<b>	
</b>	They look out. The road behind them races past at 80 mph. Beavis 
	stares dumbly.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS
</b>			Uh, you first.
<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			C'mon, Beavis, just start running really
			fast when you hit the ground. It'll work.

</b>	In the main reception area, Beavis is surrounded by a few FOREIGN

</b>			Aaaaahh...

</b><b>					AGENT

<b>	
</b><b>					TOM
</b>			Now wait just a minute...
<b>	
</b><b>					AGENT

<b>	
</b><b>					FLEMMING
</b>			Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've

</b>	Bork sees something. It's Beavis, about a hundred yards away.
<b>	
</b><b>					BORK
</b>			Chief, look!
<b>	
</b><b>					FLEMMING

</b><b>	
</b><b>	EXT.  OUTSIDE ANDERSON'S CAMPER - DAY

	to the danger.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO
</b>			I am the great Cornholio! I will lay waste
			to your bunghole! Heh heh.
<b>	
</b>	BEHIND THE AGENTS, Flemming approaches and gives orders.
<b>	
</b><b>					FLEMMING
</b>			OK, nobody shoot. He could still have the
			unit on him. Keep your distance. We don't
			wanna take a chance on hitting it.
<b>	
</b><b>					BORK
</b>			Where are his pants?
<b>	
</b><b>					FLEMMING
</b>			Who knows?
<b>	
</b>	Beavis reaches to scratch his butt. Agents step back, cautious.
<b>	
</b>	Flemming picks up a bullhorn and addresses Beavis.
<b>	
</b><b>					FLEMMING (CONT.)
</b>			This is Agent Flemming, A.T.F.. We won't

<b>	
</b><b>					BUTT-HEAD
</b>			Whoa, this rules! Can I have a gun too?
			Huh huh huh.
<b>	
</b>	ON BEAVIS. He continues to babble, making the agents nervous.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO
</b>			You must bow down to the Almighty
			Bunghole. (Beavis) Heh heh, this is cool.
			(Cornholio, chanting) Bungholio-o-o-o-o-o!
<b>	
</b><b>					FLEMMING

</b>	An agent comes out of the camper with the picture of Dallas. Bork 
	grabs it and shows it to Tom.
<b>	
</b><b>					BORK
</b>			How do you explain this?

</b>	Flemming approaches Tom.
<b>	
</b><b>					FLEMMING

<b>	
</b><b>					FLEMMING
</b>			For security reasons, your actions will

</b>	Flemming motions to the big chair. The PRESIDENT swivels around 
	and rises to shake hands with B&amp;B.
<b>	
</b><b>					PRESIDENT
</b>			Beavis and Butt-Head. On behalf of all
