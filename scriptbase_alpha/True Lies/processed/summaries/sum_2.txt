Harry Tasker: devoted father, husband, and computer salesman.
Or so everyone thinks.
In reality, Tasker is a spy in one of the United States government's highest branches.
As Tasker continues to keep his profession a secret from his family, his wife, Helen, begins to surreptitiously meet with a used car salesman, Simon.
Upon discovering this, Tasker sets out on a personal mission to win his wife back and find out Simon's true motives.
Meanwhile, a Middle Eastern terrorist organization known as "Crimson Jihad" is on the rise, threatening nuclear war with the United States if their demands are not met.
As the clock winds down, Tasker must not only fight against the bloodthirsty terrorists, but also fight to regain the trust of his family.
