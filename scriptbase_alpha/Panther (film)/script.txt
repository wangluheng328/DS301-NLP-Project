               BLACKOUT

               The SCREEN stands BLACK, like a chalkboard... or a grave.

               A SOUND builds, like a RADIO surfing channels. Snippets of 
               SONGS -- Joan Baez' "Blowin' in the Wind," James Brown's "I 
               Feel Good." The music of a different time.

               FOOTAGE

               IMAGES hit the screen: ROSA PARKS, Peace Demonstrators 
               stuffing FLOWERS in the barrels of National Guard rifles. 
               Protesters in Birmingham, rallies on the White House Lawn.

               Mixed in with the MUSIC comes NEWS BITES -- quick catchwords 
               of 60's turmoil -- "More troops to Vietnam," "Bus Boycott," 
               "Sit ins," "Draft Dodgers," "Malcolm X speaking."

               Then a SINGLE PHOTO settles on screen -- a ROW of BLACK 
               PANTHERS, fists raised, standing defiantly together.

               The IMAGE FREEZES.

                                     VOICE
                              (over)
                         The Black Panthers...

               As the PHOTO FADES, LIGHTS APPEAR. A SHAPE takes form. The 
               BAY BRIDGE arcs over silent water, spanning two worlds.

                         People still ask me how it all 
                         started? How things went so far? And 
                         like a lot of questions about the 
                         Panthers, there are different answers. 
                         Different beginnings...

               Rising behind the voice, the noise of a CROWD can be heard.

                                     VOICE

                         What became the Black Panthers really 
                         started with just two guys -- Bobby 
                         Seale and Huey Newton -- saying two 
                         words: "Defend Yourselves..." Legend 
                         has it they met at some coffee house 
                         where Bobby was running down a 
                         rhyme...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COFFEE SHOP (BLACK/WHITE) - 1966 - DAY

               TITLE: MARCH 17, 1965

               BOBBY SEALE -- a skinny, kinetic black man sporting an Afro -- 
               teeters on a chair in front of a small CROWD. He reads from 
               a crumpled sheaf of papers.

               At the side of the crowd, HUEY NEWTON -- well-built, magnetic -- 
               watches, grooving on the rhythm of the words.

                                     BOBBY
                         Oh yeah. Yeah it's easy to see right 
                         on your black and white TV. Black 
                         man. Blue cop. Red blood. Niggers 
                         watch other niggers die. That's right 
                         Niggers watching niggers die. That's 
                         the American way...

               A COMMOTION starts at the rear of the crowd. TWO UNIFORMED 
               COPS roughly make their way to Bobby. They pull him off his 
               chair, cracking his head against the ground.

               The cop over Bobby raises his NIGHTSTICK...

               A BLACK HAND grabs the club, stopping its arc.

               Shocked, the cop turns. It's HUEY. With honed precision, he 
               DECKS the cop with his free hand.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. POLICE CAR (BLACK/WHITE) - 1966 - DAY

               Bruised and bloody, Huey and Bobby sit next to each other as 
               the car moves through the streets.

                         Pigs threw them in jail. There they 
                         starting talking about black folks 
                         oughta start standing up. No master 
                         plan, no pot to piss in, nothing 
                         like that. Just two fed-up brothers... 
                         Next thing you know, you got the 
                         Black Panther Party for Self 
                         Defense...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BLACKOUT

               Again, the SCREEN goes BLACK.

                         For me, it started different. A lot 
                         different. You may as well say The 
                         Panthers started in my front yard...

               The black screen DISSOLVES into...

               EXT. CLOSE-UP: SIDEWALK - DAY

               CONCRETE, cracked and dirty, fills the frame. A BICYCLE whips 
               past, gliding down the pavement.

               EXT. 55TH AND MARKET STREETS - OAKLAND - 1967 - DAY

               TITLE: OAKLAND 1967

               Teeming with life on a bright day, the Ghetto moves to its 
               own unique cadence. A YOUNG BOY, no older than ten, pedals 
               down the street on his BICYCLE.

               A gust of wind brushes a SHAPELY WOMAN. She GRABS a HAT and 
               holds tight, ignoring her DRESS rising in the wind. The BOY 
               ogles her juicy thighs.

                                     SHAPELY WOMAN
                         Shucks I see you staring, but I ain't 
                         letting go. Them hips is almost forty 
                         years old but the hat is brand new!

               AFRAID, the boy PASSES an OAKLAND POLICE CAR, cruising slowly 
               down Market. A WHITE COP scans the street.

               EXT. MARKET STREET - DAY

               Continuing his ride, the BOY passes TYRONE (20's) -- a TOUGH 
               YOUTH -- who GLARES at the cop car, LEAFLETS in his HANDS.

               EXT. MARKET STREET - DAY

               BLACK HANDS pour a CAN of LEMON JUICE into a BOTTLE of cheap 
               WHITE PORT. Shaking the mixture, then swigging it, ROSE (30's) -- 
               an aimless drunk -- passes it to his FRIENDS.

                                     ROSE
                         Yes indeed, that Bitter Dog...
                              (to the Boy)
                         What's up little brother?

               Smiling, the YOUNG BOY waves to the sidewalk drinkers, then 
               moves on.

               EXT. MARKET STREET - DAY

               Eyes downcast, the BOY passes REVEREND SLOCUM (50's) -- a 
               passionate preacher.

               EXT. MARKET STREET - DAY

               On the street corner, SABU (20's) -- a Superfly young hustler 
               with a fast mouth -- trying to sell cigarette lighters to a 
               couple of HARD HATS heading off to work.

                                     SABU
                         I'm telling you, man. The perfect 
                         gift for the sophisticated lady in 
                         your life. Light up her flame with 
                         some solid gold satisfaction and get 
                         a second one half price for your 
                         wife. Can't beat my price with a 
                         stick, baby.

               CY, a large man with an eye-patch, walks up and tries, in 
               vain, to get one of Sabu's bogus lighters to light.

                                     CY
                         Sabu, why're you still tryin' to 
                         sell these raggedy ass, non workin' 
                         Korean lighters man?

               The HARD HATS drive off laughing as Sabu curses CY out. The 
               boy continues on heading for the corner.

               END TITLE SEQUENCE:

               EXT. INTERSECTION - 55TH AND MARKET STREETS - DAY

               Suddenly a HORN blares, BRAKES screech.

               Brutal, fast, a CAR plows into the child, sending him and 
               the bike bouncing against the windshield and back on the 
               pavement, bleeding... dead.

               EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE - 55TH STREET - DAY

               JUDGE (20's) -- an intense young man wearing a FATIGUE JACKET -- 
               STARES numbly at the child in the street. Neighborhood people 
               move toward the scene.

               A WOMAN, perhaps the boy's mother, WAILS next to the body.

               Judge's Mom, RITA (50's) -- raw boned and sharp eyed -- 
               stands, drawn toward the tragedy.

                                     RITA
                         Oh lord... not again...

               EXT. INTERSECTION - DAY

               A CROWD -- including Reverend Slocum, Cy and the DRINKERS -- 
               gathers near the child and the wailing woman. Across from 
               Judge, TYRONE keeps an angry distance from the horror.

                                     CY
                         God damn... Kid never had a chance...

                                     ROSE
                         Mothafuck... Hey!!! What the hell!!!

               The CAR backs up, trying to leave the scene.

               Market street regulars SWARM around the retreating vehicle, 
               hitting it with fists, sticks, bottles. Young and old move 
               together, their faces contorted with RAGE.

                                     JUDGE
                              (over)
                         People were pissed off. Neighborhood 
                         had been begging for a stoplight 
                         since before dirt was invented. Way 
                         I saw it then, that boy dying was 
                         another shitty thing in a world full 
                         of shit.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE - DAY

               Eyes locked on the dead child, JUDGE stands, angry and 
               impassive.

                                     JUDGE
                              (over)
                         Way I see it now... That day. That 
                         intersection. That's where it started 
                         for me.
                              (a pause)
                         Only, I didn't know it then...

               EXT. CLOSE UP: INTERSECTION PAVEMENT - DAY

               Running red past a SMALL sneakered foot, BLOOD streams toward 
               the gutter.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CLOSE UP: BASKETBALL COURT - NIGHT

               A BASKETBALL bounces off the cement, SNEAKERED FEET scramble 
               past.

               EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - NIGHT

               JUDGE drives in for a basket, pursued by CY. It's a friendly 
               three on three street game. The MARKET STREET DRINKERS -- 
               including ROSE -- fill out Cy and Judge's teams.

               Young neighborhood MEN watch the game and shoot the shit. 
               One of them, JAMAL, sports a beard and a DASHIKI.

               Somewhere a RADIO plays James Brown's "Say it Loud"

               EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - NIGHT

               Gliding around Cy, Judge sinks a basket. ROSE retrieves the 
               ball.

                                     ROSE
                         You supposed to be a wounded vet, 
                         Motherfucka. What you do in 'Nam 
                         anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?

                                     JUDGE
                         All of the above, man...
                              (a pause)
                         And then some.

               Shaking off the memory, Judge takes the ball in, PASSING it 
               to a teammate. The BALL arcs through the air...

               EXT. BASKETBALL GAME - NIGHT

               HANDS grab the ball before the teammate can. TYRONE'S hands.

               The GAME stops dead. Tyrone holds the ball, eyeing the players 
               with contempt. At his side stands LITTLE BOBBY (16) hyper, 
               childlike.

                                     TYRONE
                         Tell me, don't you fine black men 
                         got anything better to do than play 
                         games?

                                     ROSE
                         Sure I do, but your sister's busy. 
                         Gimme the damn ball.

               Tyrone passes the ball HARD to Rose.

                                     TYRONE
                         Here... Take it. I thought some 
                         righteous brothers like you might 
                         help us out, but I guess that ain't 
                         you...

                                     JAMAL
                              (stepping forward)
                         Help who? With what?

                                     TYRONE
                         Your community! That's who. Maybe 
                         you didn't know but a kid died today.

                                     LITTLE BOBBY
                         That's three this year... same spot.

                         Damn straight. And old Reverend 
                         Slocum's having a vigil on that 
                         corner, trying to get a stoplight 
                         put in.

                                     JUDGE
                              (to Cy)
                         My Mom's at that.

                         Oh I ain't. But it seems The Man's 
                         getting uptight about black folk 
                         standing in the street, causing a 
                         fuss. What I'm asking for, is some 
                         of your able black asses to come 
                         down and be "Observers" on the cops. 
                         Take down badge numbers. They don't 
                         like pulling shit with too many eyes 
                         on 'em. So that's how you can help, 
                         not by praying but by watching.

                                     DRINKER #1
                         Not me. This able black ass ain't 
                         fucking with no cops.

               Others MUMBLE in agreement, moving away from Tyrone.

                                     JAMAL
                         Look, I understand but if some Blacks 
                         insist on trying to interact with 
                         the white man, that's not our concern. 
                         We are African, "brother." Mother 
                         Africa is the only...

               Anger FLASHES in Tyrone's eyes. His voice turn knifelike.

                                     TYRONE
                         No, you look, you phony ass boojie 
                         nigger. We ain't in Africa, we're in 
                         Oakland. And in Oakland we got police 
                         brutality. We got the white man 
                         interacting his billy club up against 
                         the black man's head. Now if that 
                         don't bother you, then take your 
                         skirt wearing ass back to Africa... 
                         "Uncle."

               Jamal -- very angry -- takes a step toward Tyrone. Tyrone 
               backs him down with one fearsome look.

                                     TYRONE
                         Try it.

               Jamal backs away, joining Rose and the exiting drinkers.

                                     LITTLE BOBBY
                              (watching them go)
                         Chickenshit boojie...

                                     TYRONE
                              (to Judge and Cy)
                         What about you two? You were there, 
                         you saw that kid?

                                     JUDGE
                         I saw... but...

                                     TYRONE
                         But nothing... you do live here don't 
                         you?

               Judge glares evenly back at Tyrone, sizing him up.

                                     JUDGE
                         Yeah, I do.

                                     TYRONE
                              (to Judge and Cy)
                         Well, act like it. Come on.

               Tyrone and Little Bobby leave the court. After a beat, Judge 
               and Cy follow. ROSE calls after them, BAITING.

                                     ROSE
                         You young niggas crazy. The Man ain't 
                         gonna let us have no say in running 
                         shit! Keep it up and he's gonna come 
                         down on our ass like a ton of 
                         bricks...

               EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

               Taking confident strides, Tyrone and Little Bobby lead Cy 
               and Judge down the street.

                                     TYRONE
                         Don't let the cops provoke you. We're 
                         there to watch and take badge 
                         numbers...

                                     JUDGE
                         And who is we?

                                     LITTLE BOBBY
                         Brother where you been?
                              (a smile)
                         We're the Black Panthers.

               Cy and Judge register the name.

                                     CY
                         The Panthers...
                              (to Bobby)
                         How old are you?

                                     LITTLE BOBBY
                         Sixteen.

                                     TYRONE
                              (chuckling)
                         Shit, we made him get his moms to 
                         give permission before he could sign 
                         up.

                                     JUDGE
                         Just a kid.

                                     TYRONE
                         Yeah, well, cops kick the shit out 
                         of kids too.

               EXT. 55TH AND MARKET - NIGHT

               A CIRCLE of church folk hold flickering CANDLES in the middle 
               of the intersection. Slocum's there as well as RITA. Their 
               faces are silent, passive in the candlelight.

               POLICE CARS can be seen parked at the curbs. A small CADRE 
               of cops stands watching the congregation.

               Tyrone, Judge and Cy approach the vigil. Looking around, 
               they spot other YOUNG BLACK MEN staked out at the four corners 
               of the intersection.

                                     JUDGE
                         I thought you said all the Panthers 
                         were gonna be here.

                                     TYRONE
                         What you see is what you got.
                              (pointing)
                         That's' Bobby Seale.

               Judge's eyes pick BOBBY out, skinny, notebook at the ready.

                                     TYRONE
                         Carter... buddy of mine from way 
                         back... And Gene...

               CARTER -- enormous, terrifying -- comes into view, then GENE -- 
               a wiry street tough.

                                     LITTLE BOBBY
                         And that... that's Huey...

               Judge strains to focus on HUEY NEWTON -- who's just a 
               SILHOUETTE against a streetlight. There's a BOOK in his right 
               hand and an aura of power surrounding him.

                                     CY
                         Ain't too many of you is there?

                                     TYRONE
                              (a slight smile)
                         Only takes a single grain of sand to 
                         move the world...

                                     LITTLE BOBBY
                              (spotting something)
                         Heads up!!!!

               EXT. INTERSECTION - NIGHT

               A PATROL CAR floats to a quick stop at the curb. White haired, 
               red-faced, SERGEANT SCHRECK bounds from the car.

                                     SGT. SCHRECK
                         What in the Sam Hell is this?

                                     PATROLMAN
                         A vigil for some pickaninny got hit 
                         here.

                                     SGT. SCHRECK
                         Vigil my ass...

               Schreck GRABS a BULLHORN from the car.

                                     SCHRECK
                              (through the bullhorn)
                         Listen up, you all have 30 seconds 
                         to disperse and return to your homes.

               The LINE OF COPS takes a small step toward the black folks.

                                     SCHRECK
                         Failure to do so will result in your 
                         immediate arrest...

               The churchgoers flail a bit. Suddenly, with HUEY in the 
               background, SLOCUM steps up and with a look of defiant piety, 
               begins SINGING "We Shall Not Be Moved."

               With gathering force the CONGREGATION joins in the song.

               Schreck ROLLS HIS EYES and makes a MOTION with his hand.

               EXT. INTERSECTION - NIGHT

               COPS wade into the crowd, herding them away. A patrolman 
               pushes a MIDDLE AGED MAN, with his NIGHTSTICK.

                                     PATROLMAN
                         Go on get your black hide outta 
                         here...

               The MAN STUMBLES. By reflex, the cop RAISES his nightstick. 
               TYRONE -- on instinct -- PUSHES the cop away.

               CHAOS erupts. BILLY CLUBS snap up. Terrified, the congregation 
               RUNS.

                                     BULLHORN
                         You are resisting arrest!...

               Police slap and snatch Black folks right and left. Judge 
               bounces around in the confusion. Bobby Seale can be seen 
               trying to get badge numbers.

               Judge's eyes widen as he sees RITA running toward an alley, 
               a COP right on her ass.

                                     JUDGE
                         Oh shit Mom...

               Judge runs toward her.

               The cop lifts his BILLY CLUB over Rita... Boom!! Carter 
               PUNCHES the cop straight off his feet.

               A PAIR OF COPS have thrown Tyrone down on the ground -- 
               PISTOLS pressed against his head.

               Judge moves to Tyrone's aid. A RIFLE BUTT flashes out, 
               cracking across Judge's temple, sending him into DARKNESS.

               INT. HOLDING CELL - NIGHT

               Judge slowly comes to on the filthy floor. Cy, a few nasty 
               bruises on his face, kneels next to him protectively.

                                     JUDGE
                              (amazed, in pain)
                         Jesus...

               Disoriented, Judge sees TYRONE and the other PANTHERS. They're 
               a rag tag little group, battered, locked down. SLOCUM'S there 
               too.

               Coming fully awake, Judge realizes SOMEONE is speaking. It's 
               HUEY, his voice powerful and arresting in its urgency.

                                     HUEY
                              (over)
                         The power structure locks the black 
                         man up. That's right. We move from 
                         chains to bars and locks. Kangaroo 
                         courts put brothers in jail. No jury 
                         of our peers. No jury of black folks. 
                         How do we stop this insanity? It's 
                         simple. Organization. That's the 
                         key. We must organize. We must 
                         maintain discipline...

               Judge peers through the bodies and sees HUEY.

                                     TYRONE
                         That's right brother... listen and 
                         learn.

                                     HUEY
                         The white power structure wants us 
                         to act like savages.
                              (a smile)
                         But we're a different kind of animal 
                         altogether. We're Panthers. And The 
                         Black Panther Party for Self Defense 
                         is very painfully aware that America 
                         has historically reserved its most 
                         barbaric treatment for non-white 
                         people since the beginning of the 
                         country. So we need to organize, we
                              (a charismatic smile)
                         keep our shit correct! And effect 
                         revolution. We revolve the power 
                         into the hands of the people. Where 
                         it belongs.
                              (a beat)
                         Power to the people baby...

                                     GENE
                         Power? Shit, old folks can't even 
                         sing without getting their asses 
                         kicked.

                                     HUEY
                         Well, then like the man said... Maybe 
                         it's time we stop singing and start 
                         swinging.

                                     CARTER
                         Yeah, but they got the guns.

               Something -- some inexplicable mixture of mirth, raw 
               intelligence and fierce willpower -- crosses Huey's face.

                                     HUEY
                         We can change that. We got the right 
                         to bear arms, so I'd say it's time 
                         to exercise that right. Like Comrade 
                         Mao says, "Justice through power, 
                         Power through guns."

               EXT. COURTHOUSE STEPS - DAY

               Blinking in the sunlight, the Panthers descend wearing a 
               collective grin of relief.

                                     TYRONE
                         Chickenshits, just harassing our 
                         ass, we weren't breaking any law.

                                     REV. SLOCUM
                         But at least we're free! God has 
                         delivered us from the lion's den.

                                     BOBBY
                         Free? We're back where we started. 
                         Shit we still don't have a stop light.

                                     HUEY
                         Well as the Rev says, God helps those 
                         who help themselves.
                              (a smile)
                         We'll be our own stoplight.

               EXT. INTERSECTION - DAY

               Huey marches into the middle of the street. Amid swerving 
               cars and screeching brakes he begins DIRECTING TRAFFIC.

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               Judge and Cy split off as the other Panthers march into the 
               intersection, joining Huey's traffic duty.

                                     CY
                              (pointing)
                         Check it out... Great huh? I tell 
                         you those guys know what time it is. 
                         Man I'm with that...

                                     JUDGE
                         I don't know. Look around man.

                                     CY
                         C'mon Judge we got to start somewhere.

                                     JUDGE
                         Yeah, and I'm gonna start by getting 
                         on my feet. Working on things from 
                         inside the system.

                                     CY
                         Inside ain't in the system.
                              (poking Judge)
                         It's right there inside you!! I'm 
                         joining up.

               Judge's face cracks into a wry SMILE. Suddenly his smile 
               fades when he spots RITA staring at him from her stoop.

                                     JUDGE
                         I... I gotta go...

               Judge crosses the street, heading over to his mother.

               EXT. BROWNSTONE - DAY

               Concern searing her face, Rita regards her son warily.

                                     JUDGE
                         It's okay Mom. I'm allright.

                                     RITA
                         You don't look alright.

                                     JUDGE
                              (touching his head)
                         Yeah... cop hit me...

                                     RITA
                         I saw. I saw that big one
                              (pointing to Carter)
                         hit that police man. Saw 'em drag 
                         you off too.
                              (a beat)
                         They take you to jail?

                                     JUDGE
                              (soft)
                         Yeah.

                                     RITA
                         Lord, never thought I'd live to see 
                         my boy in prison.

                                     JUDGE
                         Mom! It wasn't like that. It was 
                         bullsh... They were just harassing 
                         us. No charges were filed. It's 
                         alright.

               Worry in her voice, Rita stares across at the Panthers.

                                     RITA
                         You meet those friends of yours in 
                         jail too?

                                     JUDGE
                         Yes... No... Mom it's not like you 
                         think. They're alright. There out 
                         there trying to do something.

                                     RITA
                         I hear them boys, those Black 
                         Panthers, they're communists. They 
                         don't even believe in God.

                                     JUDGE
                         Mom, black folks been praying to God 
                         for four hundred years. Maybe it's 
                         time we tried something else...

                                     RITA
                         You believe that?

                                     JUDGE
                         I don't know. I really don't.

               A moment passes, Rita notes her son's confusion.

                                     RITA
                         I'll tell you one thing Judge...

               EXT. INTERSECTION - DAY

               Following Huey's lead, the Panthers move traffic through the 
               intersection. CY'S with them, guiding cars past.

                                     RITA
                              (over)
                         Them boys gonna start a bunch of 
                         trouble they keep on like that.

               INT. OAKLAND POLICE HEADQUARTERS- DAY

               DORSETT, the Chief Duty Officer, shifts behind his desk, 
               popping a TUMS. A VOICE comes from the doorway.

                                     RODGERS
                              (over)
                         Those things don't work...

               Looking up, Dorsett sees RODGERS -- a hawk-faced guy with 
               slippery glasses. He's FBI down to the shine on his shoes.

                                     DORSETT
                         Don't I know it. Come on in Agent 
                         Rodgers. Sit down. Always a... 
                         pleasure to see you. How can I be of 
                         help?

                                     RODGERS
                         It's a bit more like how can we help 
                         you. Bay Area's become quite a 
                         hornet's nest in terms of subversive 
                         activities. And... well Mr. Hoover 
                         wants to reiterate that the FBI will 
                         be happy to assist local authorities 
                         in any way we can. On a strictly 
                         advisory basis... of course.

                                     DORSETT
                         Of course. Well, I appreciate your 
                         offer, but we got things pretty well 
                         under control. Same bunch of kooks 
                         you guys already have under 
                         surveillance. They're still doing a 
                         lot of yelling and pot-smoking but 
                         nothing to worry about.

                                     RODGERS
                              (cocking an eyebrow)
                         I see. What about the Black Panther 
                         Party for Self-Defense?

                                     DORSETT
                         Heh, bunch of shines running around 
                         in dark caps waving their fists about 
                         some streetlight. They're loud, but 
                         they aren't dangerous,

                                     RODGERS
                         Can you make a deal with them?

                                     DORSETT
                         Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. 
                         They actually think they're for real.

                                     RODGERS
                         Hmmm. As you know the Bureau -- and 
                         Mr. Hoover -- is particularly 
                         "sensitive" to anything that might 
                         agitate or solidify the coloreds on 
                         the left.

               Dorsett pauses for a second, trying to read the angle.

                                     DORSETT
                         You want me to put a man on it?

                                     RODGERS
                         That would be an excellent start.
                              (a pause)
                         Tell him to keep a low profile.

               EXT. FIFTY FIFTH AND MARKET - DAY

               Panthers direct traffic at the corner. On the other side of 
               the street a VW BUS with a UC BERKELEY sticker sits.

               SABU's talking to a WHITE HIPPIE in the bus.

                                     SABU
                         What do you want? Panama Red? I can 
                         get you Panama Red Sinsemilla? Got a 
                         line on some chocolate hash... get 
                         you high as a motherfucking monkey...

                                     WHITE HIPPIE
                         Uhh... man I was wondering...
                              (dropping his voice)
                         can you get some Cocaine?

                                     SABU
                         Coke? Shee-it.
                              (dropping his voice)
                         Yeah, I can get you cocaine. But 
                         it's dangerous. Cops everywhere. 
                         Gimme twenty dollars and meet me 
                         back here in an hour. And don't fuck 
                         around white boy, this is the serious 
                         shit.

                                     WHITE HIPPIE
                         Uh okay, alright. You'll be here in 
                         an hour?

                                     SABU
                         Yeah I'll be here.

               Sabu grabs a TWENTY from the van. He SMILES as the van pulls 
               away.

                                     SABU
                              (to himself)
                         Now that was one dumb motherfucker...

               Cy, Tyrone at his side, APPEARS.

                                     CY
                         Sabu, what the fuck you doing? Ain't 
                         nobody gonna push on this street.

                                     SABU
                         Shit, I ain't doing nothing. White 
                         bread asks for cocaine, I take his 
                         money. Shit... you know... It was 
                         just a hustle.

                                     CY
                         Sabu... High white dude's the only 
                         thing you could hustle.

                                     SABU
                         Man... fuck you. Why you always 
                         bustin' my balls? All that high and 
                         mighty militant shit. I ain't doing 
                         nothing.

                                     TYRONE
                         I dig, you just hustling. But you 
                         make sure it stays like that brother, 
                         or you will have much grief on your 
                         sorry ass.

               Cy lets Sabu go. He scrambles down the street.

                                     SABU
                              (to himself)
                         Motherfucking Panthers, worse than 
                         the police...

               INT. UNMARKED CAR - FIFTY FIFTH AND MARKET - DAY

               Nestled among empty paper COFFEE CUPS, BRIMMER - a once 
               athletic white cop -- watches the Panthers at the corner. He 
               stubs yet another CIGARETTE into an overflowing ashtray.

               Brimmer sees CY taking over traffic duty from CARTER. There's 
               a NOTEPAD on the seat next to Brimmer. He makes a HASH MARK 
               in it -- COUNTING Panther heads.

               EXT. STAIRS - DAY

               Bottle of BITTER DOG in hand, Rose sits with the other 
               drinkers, STARING at Brimmer's car. Taking a swig and smiling 
               at his buddies, Rose walks toward the car.

               EXT. UNMARKED CAR - DAY

               Sauntering up to the car, Rose flashes a wicked grin.

                                     ROSE
                         What's the matter Casper, you lost 
                         or something?

               Brimmer IGNORES him.

                                     ROSE
                         Hey! I'm talking to you.

               Rolling his eyes, BRIMMER holds up his BADGE. A gold 
               DETECTIVE'S shield gleams at Rose through the glass.

                                     ROSE
                         Ohhhh... Looky there...
                              (to the other drinkers)
                         It's a Cop...

               Behind him the other drinkers RISE, checking Brimmer out.

               INT. BRIMMER'S CAR - DAY

               Brimmer fumes, so much for keeping a low profile.

                                     BRIMMER
                         Fuck.

               The Detective STARTS his car.

               EXT. FIFTY FIFTH AND MARKET - DAY

               Rose and the others goofing at him, Brimmer PULLS AWAY from 
               the curb.

               EXT. PANTHER HQ - DAY

               BRIMMER'S CAR glides by the storefront.

               INT. PANTHER HQ - DAY

               HUEY talks earnestly with TYRONE and GENE.

                                     HUEY
                         ...Yeah, it's a perfect next step, 
                         let the community know that we're 
                         dedicated to Malcolm's ideals...
                              (checking his watch)
                         Damn where's Bobby Seale?

               BOBBY SEALE, a whirlwind of energy, come careening through 
               the door.

                                     BOBBY SEALE
                         Huey!! Man you gotta check this out... 
                         You're gonna love...

                                     HUEY
                              (interrupting)
                         Hold up a second... We got a decision 
                         to make.

                                     BOBBY SEALE
                         What's up?

                                     HUEY
                         Dig it, you know those brothers over 
                         in San Fran... call themselves the 
                         Black Panthers too?

                                     BOBBY SEALE
                         Sure, those boojie jokers don't do 
                         anything except print up a lotta 
                         paper saying "Black is Beautiful."

                                     TYRONE
                         Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers.

                                     HUEY
                              (a smile)
                         Yeah... but it seems they're bringing 
                         Malcolm's widow Betty Shabazz to 
                         town, to speak at a rally, do an 
                         interview for Ramparts.
                              (a pause)
                         And they want us to help with 
                         security.

                                     BOBBY
                         Well if anyone's gonna protect 
                         Malcolm's legacy it better be us.

                                     HUEY
                         Damn straight...
                              (rising)
                         Let's go check out these Paper 
                         Panthers.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BLACK PANTHER OFFICE - DAY

               BOBBY'S PONTIAC sits in front of a rather upscale house, on 
               a street that would never be mistaken for Oakland.

               INT. BLACK PANTHER OFFICE - DAY

               Looking street and very tough, BOBBY, HUEY, TYRONE, LITTLE 
               BOBBY and GENE walk in. Spotting them, ROY -- the Paper 
               Panther President -- picks his afro and smoothes his DASHIKI 
               vainly.

               In the background other men in AFRICAN GARB can be seen, 
               along with ALMA - a REGAL BLACK GIRL.

                                     ROY
                         Greetings African brothers... You're 
                         here to help us with Sister Shabazz 
                         no doubt?

                                     TYRONE
                              (under his breath)
                         Fucking boojie...

                                     HUEY
                         That's right. We'd be proud to provide 
                         as escort for Malcolm's widow. How 
                         many men you got?

                                     ROY
                              (to Alma)
                         Get the brothers a beer. Me too while 
                         you're at it.
                              (to Huey)
                         Men? Well we can spare six for 
                         security...

                                     HUEY
                              (to Alma, declining 
                              the beer)
                         No thank you sister.
                              (to Roy)
                         Six?!! That seems a little light. 
                         Cops are watching Betty, watching 
                         her hard. We need at least twenty 
                         men. And that's twenty armed Panthers 
                         dig? You do have guns don't you?

                                     ROY
                         I assure you that we as the 
                         revolutionary vanguard are as serious 
                         about this as you are. We'll be 
                         prepared.

               EXT. BLACK PANTHER OFFICE - DAY

               Disgusted, HUEY stalks to the car with the others.

                                     TYRONE
                         They ain't fit for the name Panthers.

                                     BOBBY
                         Twenty men? I don't know if we got 
                         that.

                                     HUEY
                         We'll get them. Right now we got to 
                         worry about being armed and ready to 
                         protect Betty Shabazz. Those phonies 
                         sure as hell can't. We need guns.

                                     TYRONE
                         We need money first...

                                     HUEY
                         Yeah... Bobby you gotta...

                                     BOBBY
                              (moving)
                         Got it covered Huey, that's what I 
                         was trying to tell you before. Check 
                         it out...

               Bobby's pops the PONTIAC'S TRUNK. BOXES sit inside it, 
               overflowing with LITTLE RED BOOKS.

                                     BOBBY
                         Bought every copy in Chinatown. Got 
                         us a discount too, thirty cents a 
                         piece.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SATHER GATE - BERKELEY CAMPUS - DAY

               In the stream of students, Tyrone, Huey and THE PANTHERS 
               hold up Mao's LITTLE RED BOOK. A RADIO can be heard blaring 
               Gladys Knight's "Heard it through the Grapevine."

                                     HUEY
                         Here it is Brothers. The Lowdown 
                         straight from comrade Mao's mouth.
                              (to Bobby)
                         If you open the minds, the bodies 
                         will follow.

               CARTER moves toward Huey with TWO WHITE STUDENTS

                                     CARTER
                              (looking confused)
                         Huey uhhh... these... these guys 
                         want to join...

               Huey smiles and shakes his head congenially.

                                     HUEY
                         I'm sorry boys. But right now The 
                         Party feels it's important for Black 
                         People to do it for themselves. We're 
                         not signing up white folk.
                              (the trademark smile)
                         But, if you are down with what we're 
                         doing, organize some righteous white 
                         folks. I got a feeling we're gonna 
                         need each other.

               EXT. SATHER GATE - DAY

               Judge, holding notes and SCHOOLBOOKS spots the Panthers. Cy 
               catches his eye.

                                     JUDGE
                         Hey, this what they got you doing 
                         now?

                                     CY
                         Party needs the bread.
                              (to the students)
                         Be hip to the struggle, only a 
                         dollar!!!

                                     STUDENT
                         A dollar? Far out! Is it authentic?

                                     CY
                         Comrade, this here's the real deal, 
                         straight from Revolution HQ.

                                     STUDENT
                         Huh?
                              (catching on)
                         Hey, I can dig it man.
                              (buying book)
                         Thanks! Long live the revolution, 
                         brother.

                                     CY
                              (to Judge, pocketing 
                              the bills)
                         Money's cool, but what the party 
                         really needs is brothers like you.
                              (hands Judge a RED 
                              BOOK)
                         Judge I could use someone like you. 
                         These books, hell I don't know half 
                         the words. You might.

                                     JUDGE
                         Have to pass on the revolution today 
                         man, I got class... But how about 
                         tonight, I was gonna check out "Cloud 
                         Nine." Just like old times.

                                     CY
                         Can't... they're having a PE meeting 
                         at Headquarters tonight, come on 
                         down. Check it out.

                                     JUDGE
                         PE? What? You guys doing gym class?

                                     CY
                         No man. PE -- "political education."

               TYRONE moves closer to Cy, checking out Judge

                                     TYRONE
                         You're a smart brother... you should 
                         dig what Huey and Bobby got to say...

                                     JUDGE
                         Maybe...

                                     TYRONE
                              (a smile)
                         Fuck maybe... be there.

               Judge grins back at Tyrone, holding ground.

                                     JUDGE
                         Like I said... maybe.

               EXT. PANTHER HEADQUARTERS - 56TH AND GROVE - NIGHT

               Essentially a storefront, the PANTHER HQ's a rag-tag, hipster 
               shrine. POSTERS hangs in the window -- "BLACK IS BEAUTIFUL," 
               the BLACK PANTHER LOGO, an upraised BLACK FIST.

               CY and JUDGE walk past a couple of loitering street folk. 
               ROSE is there, happily munching on a paper plate of stew.

                                     JUDGE
                         Rose, what the hell you doing here?

                                     ROSE
                         Just come for the food, man. Ain't 
                         quite sure what their bag is but...

               Rose POINTS through the doorway to BOBBY SEALE standing at a 
               podium speaking front of a very small GROUP.

                                     ROSE
                         That one's one hell of a cook...

               INT. PANTHER HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

               Little Bobby and Tyrone PASS out LEAFLETS labeled with "What 
               we want" and What we Believe" to a SMALL ASSEMBLY.

               At the podium, Bobby SPEAKS passionately. Judge and Cy make 
               for empty secondhand seat.

                         ...We... the Black Panther Party are 
                         not anarchists. We want a government 
                         that serves the people. In the black 
                         community we want a government that 
                         serves black people. Black cops for 
                         Black People. Not the Army we have 
                         occupying the community "Army?" you 
                         ask. "What army? This isn't Vietnam." 
                         Well the Army's right out your door 
                         folks. They're the cops.

               A chorus of "Yeahs," "Right Ons and APPLAUSE."

                                     BOBBY
                         They're pigs brothers and sisters. 
                         And these pigs are soldiers fighting 
                         against us. Whether you got an Afro 
                         or a process on. Whether a sister's 
                         got her hair straightened or whether 
                         she's got a natural on. Whether it's 
                         a brother in a dashiki or a pimp 
                         with a sharp suit on. Whether a 
                         sister's prostituting or teaching 
                         kids to read. The pig will murder 
                         you because you're black. No matter 
                         what kind of hair you wear. So we 
                         best get ourselves together, organize, 
                         learn our history and put the power 
                         in the hands of the black community 
                         before this army, these pigs wipe 
                         this community out.

               Applause rings out. Even JUDGE claps.

               INT. PANTHER HQ - NIGHT

               Political Education over, the small group of Panthers and 
               neighborhood folk, chat as Judge makes his way over to Cy.

                                     CY
                         ...Glad you came man.

                                     JUDGE
                         Yeah, only I figure you'd be the one 
                         doing the speaking.

                                     CY
                         Not yet, one of these day's maybe. 
                         Bobby's party chairman. Political 
                         Education's really his bag.

               Huey steps up with TYRONE.

                                     HUEY
                         You're Cy's Vietnam buddy right?
                              (Judge nods)
                         C'mere I'd like to talk with you...

               Huey pulls Judge toward a BACK ROOM, Tyrone watches them 
               leave, protective, suspicious...

                                     HUEY
                         You were. infantry right?

                                     JUDGE
                         Yeah.

                                     HUEY
                         So I guess it's safe to say you know 
                         about firepower.

               INT. YANG'S HARDWARE - SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT

               CLOSE UP: A nest of WEAPONS -- shotguns, M1's, handguns -- 
               sit is on a DESK in the cluttered back room of the store.

               Judge's hands run over the guns, checking them out. He sets 
               an AUTOMATIC aside.

                                     JUDGE
                         Busted firing pin.
                              (checking a revolver)
                         You want only the legal stuff right?

                                     TYRONE
                         Just the legit shit.

               Judge SETS ASIDE the revolver.

               MR. YANG -- a nervous oriental man -- hovers over them.

                                     MR. YANG
                         Nothing wrong with that pistol.

                                     JUDGE
                         Serial number's been filed. Cop 
                         catches you with that he figures you 
                         either stole it or killed someone 
                         with it...

                                     MR. YANG
                         I don't want no trouble. No cops 
                         coming to me about these guns.

                                     HUEY
                         No trouble here. You got a permit to 
                         sell.
                              (handing over cash)
                         We're buying. All perfectly legal.

                                     MR. YANG
                              (counting)
                         These are worth a lot more.

                         Alright.

               EXT. HARDWARE STORE - NIGHT

               Cy and Tyrone load the weapons into Cy's VAN. Bobby, Huey, 
               and Judge talk.

                                     HUEY
                         We appreciate your help with this.

                                     JUDGE
                         So what's the deal?

                                     HUEY
                              (a smile)
                         Freedom... We're just gonna test 
                         some of the words in that law book.

               Truck loaded, the Panthers make to leave. Huey lingers a bit 
               with Judge.

                                     HUEY
                         Judge... we're doing security for 
                         Betty Shabazz's visit next week. I'd 
                         like to have someone who knows there 
                         way around a pistol there. Someone 
                         like you.

                                     JUDGE
                         I don't know.

                                     HUEY
                         You are down for protecting Malcolm's 
                         widow aren't you?

                                     JUDGE
                         Yeah... let me think about it.

                                     HUEY
                         Okay man I ain't going to push. But 
                         remember the revolution isn't going 
                         to wait for anyone. Come on, we'll 
                         give you a lift.

                                     JUDGE
                         No man. Gonna walk.

               Tyrone watches Judge warily as he turns and walks away.

               MONTAGE:

               EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

               Judge, feet moving across pavement, walks alone.

               INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

               A WHITE PROFESSOR nasally drones about ECONOMICS as Judge 
               stares out the window, watching PANTHERS sell RED BOOKS.

               EXT. GHETTO - DAY

               Panthers exhorting the community. Chaos slowly turning into 
               organizations, repainting, sickle cell program, and handing 
               out bags of food as BRIMMER watches from his car.

               EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

               A COP CRUISER slowly passes Judge as he walks, shining its 
               SPOTLIGHT on him.

               INT. JUDGE AND CY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               It's late. Judge studies a TEXT BOOK. Next to it sits MAO'S 
               RED BOOK. He can't concentrate. Grabbing his jacket, Judge 
               heads out the DOOR.

               END MONTAGE:

               INT. BOBBY'S PONTIAC NIGHT

               Huey's DRIVING. Bobby's next to him, a RIFLE on his lap. 
               Tyrone and CY sit in back. They're all in UNIFORM.

                                     HUEY
                              (to Cy)
                         This here's a "Panther Patrol." We 
                         see a brother getting busted. We 
                         check it out, make sure the pig don't 
                         go beating on the man. Brother gets 
                         taken downtown, we post bail, hook 
                         'em up with a lawyer.

                                     TYRONE
                         We're like policing the police.

               Huey SPOTS something through the windshield a COP CAR.

                                     HUEY
                              (pulling over)
                         Damn straight.

               EXT. GROVE STREET - NIGHT

               TWO BEEFY COPS have a BLACK MAN up against the wall. Panther's 
               Pontiac pulls to the curb. The cops TURN...

               HUEY -- holding a RIFLE, backed by the other Panthers -- 
               stares solidly at the policeman.

                                     BEEFY COP #1
                              (into radio)
                         Get me some back up...

               In the BACKGROUND, the man against the wall SCOOTS AWAY.

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               Walking thinking, Judge moves down the street. After a bit, 
               RED LIGHTS can be seen on the wall behind him. Judge MOVES 
               quickly toward the lights, SPOTTING something.

               EXT. GROVE STREET - NIGHT

               Near Panther HQ, FIGURES move in silhouette against a SQUAD 
               CAR's HEADLIGHTS.

               High tension as HUEY and BOBBY SEALE stand next to the beat 
               up PONTIAC holding a RIFLE. THE BEEFY COP faces him -- 
               flashlight in one hand, Huey's LICENSE in the other.

               Cy, Tyrone and other Panthers -- in full PANTHER UNIFORMS -- 
               move through the crowd passing out BLACK PANTHER PARTY TEN 
               POINT PROGRAMS.

                                     BEEFY COP
                         Okay now, er, Huey, so what's your 
                         telephone number?

                                     HUEY
                         I have confirmed to you my address, 
                         that's all I'm required to by law to 
                         do. We have broken no law.

                                     BEEFY COP
                         What are you doing with the gun?

                                     HUEY
                              (calm, controlled)
                         What are doing with yours?.

               As JUDGE pushes through the semi-circle of black folks, TWO 
               MORE SQUAD CARS pull up. The cops inside swagger over. One 
               of them a BABY FACED COP, has his NIGHT STICK drawn.

                                     BABY FACED COP
                         These boys giving you trouble?

               Beefy Cop shines his light on the PASSENGER SEAT of the 
               Pontiac. It illuminates a PISTOL.

                                     BEEFY COP
                         Here's another one. That your pistol 
                         there?

               Bobby Seale reaches over and PICKS UP the pistol. The Panthers 
               snap to a STRAIGHT LINE behind Huey.

                                     BOBBY
                         No! It is not his weapon. A handgun 
                         would be a violation of his probation. 
                         It's mine!

               Nearby, THE CLOUD NINE NIGHTCLUB pulses with MUSIC. Purple 
               suited hipsters move onto the sidewalk observing the 
               escalating scene between Panthers and police.

                                     BEEFY COP
                              (stretching out his 
                              hand)
                         Lemme see that rifle son...

                              (snatching the gun 
                              away)
                         No! This is my private property. 
                         According to California law we have 
                         a constitutional right to bear arms.

                         Okay. Okay. Move along. Go on about 
                         your business...

               Reluctant but docile, the crowd begins to DISPERSE.

                                     HUEY
                         Wait!! Brothers! Sisters!! You don't 
                         have to go anywhere. This is your 
                         business. Stay right here. The law 
                         says as long as you keep a reasonable 
                         distance, eight to ten feet to be 
                         exact, you've got a right to observe 
                         the police carrying out their duties. 
                         From what I can see, you're standing 
                         some 22 feet away from this man here. 
                         So brothers ain't no law being broken.

               Emboldened by Huey's words, the crowd REGROUPS.

                                     BLACK VOICE IN CROWD
                         Talk that good shit Brother...

                                     BEEFY COP
                         Is that gun loaded BOY?!!

               The crowd GASPS, then goes silent as Huey steps right up 
               into the cop's face.

                                     HUEY
                         Fish and Game laws clearly state 
                         that it is unlawful to have a live 
                         round of ammunition in the chamber 
                         of a shotgun or rifle in a vehicle... 
                         PIG!!

                                     BLACK VOICE IN CROWD
                         Oh sweet Jesus, I do believe I have 
                         died and gone to heaven...

                                     COP #2
                         Refer to him as officer.

                                     BOBBY
                         Well then don't refer to him as BOY!

                                     BEEFY COP
                              (glaring)
                         Well... is it loaded?

                                     HUEY
                         I tell you "officer", it wasn't...

               Huey COCKS A ROUND into the chamber.

                                     HUEY
                         ...but now IT IS!

               The cops TENSE. The Beefy One blows a gasket.

                                     BEEFY COP
                         For the last time Boy!!! What do 
                         those guns mean??!!

                                     HUEY
                         They mean, Pig!, that the Black 
                         Panther Party declares that if you 
                         try to brutalize our community or 
                         take our weapons.
                              (a beat)
                         We are going to shoot you!!!

               The crowd stands FROZEN. Joy spreads out beneath their guarded 
               ghetto masks.

                                     BLACK VOICE IN CROWD
                              (whirling like a 
                              dervish)
                         Pigs that's just what the hell they 
                         are!!!

               Cops and Panthers stand TOE TO TOE. Deadly moments pass. Cop 
               eyes flash from Panthers to Crowd. Then something TURNS. The 
               cops BACK OFF, climbing into their cars.

               GROVE STREET - NIGHT

               Judge moves away, walking down the street. He senses the joy 
               and amazement of the community, picking up on SNATCHES OF 
               CONVERSATION from a dozen different doorways.

                                     VOICE
                              (over)
                         Never thought I'd live to see the 
                         day! You know the police ain't nothing 
                         but the KKK with badges.

               A breeze wafts a TEN POINT PROGRAM past Judge. Slowly, 
               thoughtfully he picks the leaflet up.

               INT. DORSETT'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               CLOSE UP: A TEN POINT PROGRAM sits in Dorsett's fleshy 
               fingers.

               It's after hours as Dorsett, Rodgers and BRIMMER - each 
               holding PAMPHLETS -- have a tense "discussion".

                                     DORSETT
                         One: "We want freedom. We want the 
                         power to determine the destiny of 
                         our Black Community." Two: "We want 
                         full employment for our people." 
                         Three: "We want to end the robbery 
                         by the white man of our Black 
                         Community." Christ, they're asking 
                         for reparations...

                                     RODGERS
                         They couldn't have thought this up 
                         for themselves.

                                     BRIMMER
                              (sarcastic)
                         Yeah... Sounds like the Constitution 
                         to me. With a little of the Bill of 
                         Rights thrown in...

                                     RODGERS
                         Inspector Brimmer, this is no joke 
                         During your surveillance have you 
                         seen any outside agitators? 
                         Professorial types? Communists?

                                     BRIMMER
                         No. I've seen Black men handing out 
                         bags of food. Having meetings. 
                         Patrolling the neighborhood. Having 
                         more meetings. They ain't...

                                     RODGERS
                         They are carrying guns. They are 
                         threatening police officers. They 
                         are undermining the United States of 
                         America. And you Inspector Brimmer 
                         are not taking your duties 
                         seriously...

                                     DORSETT
                         Now hold on Rodgers...

                                     RODGERS
                         Chief Dorsett, if the Black Panthers 
                         are going to remain in your 
                         jurisdiction, some fundamental changes 
                         in attitude need to be made...

                                     BRIMMER
                         Like?

                                     RODGERS
                         Like, you Inspector Brimmer are not 
                         going to be sitting in your car 
                         anymore. I think it's time for a 
                         more active type of involvement.

               EXT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

               Beat by late hours, DORSETT walks to his car -- a brand new 
               CADILLAC, sitting in his 'reserved' spot.

               A LIMOUSINE pulls up next to him. Its window rolls down. At 
               first we don't see the passenger's face.

                                     VOICE
                         Evening Chief. Another hard day 
                         keeping the streets safe?

                                     DORSETT
                              (forced joviality)
                         What are you doing out so late?

                                     VOICE
                         I like to keep an eye on my 
                         "investments" so to speak. You know 
                         we still need to discuss that business 
                         expansion we spoke of.

                                     DORSETT
                              (ill at ease)
                         Look, I don't think...

               LOUIS TRAFFICANTE -- all style, all mobster -- LEANS out the 
               window. His right hand man, TONY, at the wheel. He points to 
               the Cadillac.

                                     TRAFFICANTE
                         That's a beautiful car. You'd do 
                         well to remember who paid for it. 
                         Good night, Chief, we'll speak again 
                         soon.

               INT. JUDGE AND CY'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Dawn pushes pink against the loft windows as Judge, dressed 
               for class, pores over Cy's copy of "Wretched of the Earth."

                                     CY
                              (coming out)
                         Man, did you see Huey down on Grove 
                         street? All up on that cop, that was 
                         beautiful.

                                     JUDGE
                         Yeah, it was alright. Hey, can you 
                         give me a lift?

                                     CY
                         You got it. Berkeley?

                                     JUDGE
                         No, Panther Headquarters.
                              (a smile)
                         Least that way we could hang out 
                         more like we used to.

                                     CY
                         You joining? My Brother..
                              (hugging Judge)
                         My brother.

               INT. PANTHER HQ - DAY

               Panther HQ has improved. Bobby Seale stands behind a newly 
               painted display counter, interviewing NEW RECRUITS.

               BOBBY'S POV - FACE MONTAGE

               FACES -- all of them BLACK, all of them MEN, most of them 
               ANGRY -- flash into the frame, each talking.

                                     FACE #1
                         Sign me up!! Just gimme a gun and 
                         point out the cops you want me to 
                         shoot...

                                     FACE #2
                         Where's the free food at?

                                     FACE #3
                         My momma, she marched with King. 
                         Don't know exactly what kinda change 
                         that brought. But man you put that 
                         cop on Grove through some serious 
                         changes!!!

                                     FACE #4
                         I hear you Panther boys get the finest 
                         pussy.

                                     FACE #5
                         Vietnam man... I go there and then 
                         come back to some honky motherfucker 
                         telling me what to do, beating my 
                         ass if I don't. Man... fuck that.

               A FINAL FACE comes into view... JUDGE'S

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PANTHER HQ - DAY

               CY stands proudly next to Judge in front of Bobby.

                                     CY
                         Judge is gonna join us.

               Tyrone looks less than pleased at the news.

                                     BOBBY
                         Welcome Brother, if we stand together 
                         we can break the chains.

                                     TYRONE
                              (miffed, to Judge)
                         Huey wants to see you.

                                     JUDGE
                         Huh?

                                     TYRONE
                         He had a feeling you'd be coming by.

               INT. BACKROOM - DAY

               Judge moves warily into the dim and musty room. As his eyes 
               acclimate to the gloom he spots HUEY sitting half hidden in 
               the shadows.

                                     HUEY
                         Welcome brother, have you decided to 
                         get down with us?

                                     JUDGE
                         I'm down.

                                     HUEY
                         Yeah... You were a lot of help with 
                         those guns. Your soldier shit is bad-
                         ass.

                                     JUDGE
                         I'd hoped I was finished with all 
                         that. But...
                              (shrugs)

                                     HUEY
                         You know, you're lucky to be back. 
                         Most niggers die on the front lines. 
                         Seems like that's what they're there 
                         for.

                                     JUDGE
                         Don't I know it. Every brother I 
                         knew in 'Nam's dead. My company... a 
                         land mine. Twenty of my friends dead 
                         in less than a second.

                                     HUEY
                         Mind if I ask you something? Why'd 
                         you put up with shit like that for 
                         someone else's war?

               Judge flashes Huey a look of bare honesty.

                                     JUDGE
                         Hey, GI bill pays for school. And 
                         shit, if I stuck around here, instead 
                         of signing up, I'd probably be in 
                         jail, or sitting on the stoop drinking 
                         Bitter Dog with Rose, you know?

                                     HUEY
                         Yeah I know. You're smart Judge. You 
                         ain't no bourgeois nigger like those 
                         Paper Panthers across the bay. I 
                         need every good man to help us with 
                         the security on Betty Shabazz, 
                         particularly soldiers. You do solid 
                         on that I might have something else 
                         for you, something real important.

                                     JUDGE
                         Whatever you need, I'll be there.

                                     HUEY
                         Right on Brother Judge...

               Huey and Judge grip HANDS.

               EXT. OAKLAND AIRPORT - DAY

               TITLE: FEBRUARY 21, 1967

               With tight precision, HUEY, TYRONE, JUDGE, CY, GENE, BOBBY, 
               CARTER and LITTLE BOBBY form a circle around BETTY SHABAZZ 
               guiding her past AIRPORT POLICE to a waiting car.

               Led by ROY the PAPER PANTHERS seem useless in their dashikis 
               and fluffed Afros.

               INT. RAMPARTS OFFICE - DAY

               In an INNER OFFICE, Betty Shabazz talks with ELDRIDGE, a 
               tall man wearing sunglasses. In the OUTER OFFICE, Huey's 
               PANTHERS stand by while ROY'S PAPER PANTHERS do little.

                                     ELDRIDGE
                         What would you tell young brothers 
                         and sisters to do in following Brother 
                         Malcolm's footsteps?

                                     BETTY SHABAZZ
                         I'd say that Malcolm lives in each 
                         of us. We all need to work together 
                         for the community.
                              (gesturing outside)
                         Like those brothers out there are...

               Overhearing, Roy PREENS a bit at Betty's words. Nearby JUDGE 
               flicks his eyes to the GUN at Roy's waistband.

                                     JUDGE
                              (low)
                         Huey...

               Suddenly ROY spots something outside... POLICE CARS, followed 
               closely by NEWS VANS.

                                     ROY
                              (nervous)
                         Oh oh...

               Snapping up his SHOTGUN, Huey nods to the others. Bobby Seale 
               pulls back his jacket revealing a .45.

               Solemn, professional, Huey and the Panthers file out the 
               door. ROY'S PAPER PANTHERS hang behind.

               EXT. RAMPARTS OFFICE - DAY

               Led by Huey, the Panthers take up a line between the cops 
               and the office. REPORTERS, expecting another GROVE STREET, 
               push forward.

                                     COP #1
                              (eyeing Huey's gun)
                         What's going on here son?

                                     HUEY
                         We are breaking no law, you've have 
                         no right to detain us.

               A REPORTER spots BETTY SHABAZZ, flanked by JUDGE and TYRONE 
               leaving the building heading toward a car.

                                     REPORTER
                         There she is!!!

               Surging forward the reporters PUSH CAMERAS toward BETTY 
               SHABAZZ. One of them, CHUCK, tries to push HUEY away.

               Controlled, Huey holds Chuck in check, watching Betty move 
               toward the car. Chuck PUSHES FORWARD trying to get a PICTURE.

               Seeing Betty safely inside and the car PULLING AWAY, Huey 
               SHOVES Chuck back. Chuck makes to swing at Huey. Huey SHOVES 
               HIM DOWN.

                                     HUEY
                              (to Cop #1)
                         Arrest this man!!!

                                     COP #1
                         If I'm gonna arrest anyone it's going 
                         to be you...

               Fast, the PANTHERS take up position behind Huey, their GUNS 
               highly visible. Huey flicks the SAFETY of his shotgun.

                                     HUEY
                         Not today!!

               ROY come running out, UNARMED, scared yelling at Huey.

                                     ROY
                         Don't point that gun!!!

                                     COP #1
                         That's right be a smart nigger like 
                         your friend.

               TENSION ripples through the air as ROY runs back inside. 
               Huey glares at the cop.

                                     HUEY
                         He's not my friend and I promise you 
                         pig. Your men draw and this will be 
                         a blood bath. It's your call.

               EVERY PANTHER stands facing the cops, weapons at the ready. 
               THROUGH the glass PAPER PANTHERS can be seen HIDING.

               Slowly the cops begin backing away.

                                     CHUCK
                              (to the cops)
                         Aren't you going to do anything...

                                     COP #1
                              (nervous)
                         Like he said asshole, they're not 
                         breaking any law...

               Screeching their TIRES the police leave.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BOBBY'S CAR - NIGHT

               Packed in the car, Bobby, Little Bobby, Judge, Cy and Tyrone 
               recount the day as HUEY drives.

                                     LITTLE BOBBY
                         You see that on jive dashiki man, 
                         hiding under the desk. Shit paper 
                         panthers.

               Huey notices JUDGE'S SILENCE.

                                     HUEY
                         What it be Judge. Nobody got hurt, 
                         Sister Betty's safe. This was a good 
                         day...

                                     JUDGE
                         They were empty...

                                     BOBBY
                         What was empty?

                                     JUDGE
                         The Paper Panthers' guns, they weren't 
                         loaded. I know guns man. Those guns 
                         were empty.

               Huey's KNUCKLES TIGHTEN on the steering wheel.

               EXT. YARD - DAY

               FISH fries on a grill as ROY and the PAPER PANTHERS celebrate. 
               Alma's looking DISGUSTED with the whole thing.

                                     ROY
                         Like I say Brothers we are the 
                         vanguard.
                              (to Alma)
                         Get me a beer... I tell you once 
                         Cleaver's story comes out, we're 
                         gonna...

               ROY'S face DROPS as HUEY AND THE OTHER PANTHERS appear at 
               the edge of the party. Huey marches up, YANKING Roy's gun 
               from his pants, checking it.

                                     HUEY
                         We put our lives on the line today. 
                         Malcolm X's widow was on the line 
                         today. And your guns weren't even 
                         loaded.

                                     ROY
                         A gun's a gun man. It don't need to 
                         be loaded.

                                     HUEY
                         Tell that to the pigs. Better yet 
                         tell that to Malcolm.

                                     ROY
                         Wait a second there brother...

                                     HUEY
                         No you wait a second. You and your 
                         "Panthers" got three choices. One 
                         you join with us and follow our rules. 
                         Two you change your name.
                              (a smile)
                         Or three you face annihilation.

               PAPER PANTHERS step up, Huey's men follow suit. Judge standing 
               right at Huey's.

                                     ROY
                         Pretty boy, you're a long way from 
                         Oakland. Fuck you.

               Bam! Huey hits Roy with a ferocious hook. A BIG PAPER PANTHER 
               moves on Huey, Judge DROPS HIM like a stone.

               In seconds Huey's men have kicked the shit out of the Paper 
               Panthers. Huey's got ROY'S FACE in the grill.

                                     HUEY
                         You're exactly the kind of brother 
                         we don't need. Kind of brother who 
                         gets others killed. Now you gonna 
                         change your name.

               Huey pulls Roy up, his SINGED BEARD covered with fish and 
               onions. ROY just glares silently.

                                     ALMA
                         Roy, tell him you'll do it.

               Huey shoves Roy's face back down toward the grill.

                                     ROY
                         Please!!! Yes!!! We'll change the 
                         name.

               Throwing ROY away, Huey LOCKS EYES with Alma as the Panthers 
               depart. She watches them every step of the way.

               Nearby SOMEONE ELSE watches the Panthers also. ELDRIDGE 
               CLEAVER, the reporter from Ramparts.

               INT. HUEY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Unwinding, alone with Judge, Huey hands him a beer.

                                     HUEY
                         You were alright Judge, better than 
                         alright. You're what the Party needs. 
                         A fighter but also one that's going 
                         to school not making the man too 
                         nervous.

                                     JUDGE
                         I don't know about that.

                                     HUEY
                         I do. You think you're smart enough 
                         to keep playing the game?

                                     JUDGE
                         What, I don't know how you mean?

                                     HUEY
                         See, the thing about Panthers. For 
                         all their speed and strength. They 
                         are not naturally aggressive. They 
                         don't just go out killing, tearing 
                         through the jungles murdering. No, 
                         the Panther
                              (makes a fist)
                         keeps his claws hidden until he is 
                         attacked, until he's backed into a 
                         corner. Then
                              (opens his fist)
                         believe me those claws are fierce.

                                     JUDGE
                         Huey, you're losing me. What are you 
                         talking about?

                                     HUEY
                         I'm talking about survival. Yours, 
                         mine, all of it. Outside and in. You 
                         got to do something for me. Staying 
                         alive might depend on it. The pigs 
                         are gonna try to infiltrate us and 
                         we're gonna let 'em. But their spy's 
                         gonna be our spy too. How about it?

               There's a pause as Judge chews on the grave proposition.

                                     JUDGE
                         Me? You've got a whole lot of other 
                         folks signing up. Why me?

                                     HUEY
                         You fit the profile, Brother. You 
                         look exactly like the kind of nigger 
                         they think they can trust...

               The Uber-cop himself sits at the desk, his large watery eyes

               Bobby and Tyrone stand there uncomfortably facing ALMA and a 
               platoon of SISTERS.

               Tyrone and Cy watch as Judge holds an M1 RIFLE, lecturing 
               NEW RECRUITS. Each recruit has a DISASSEMBLED RIFLE. Judge 
               starts his stopwatch. The RECRUITS fumble with the rifles. 
               Suddenly a sound -- the perfect clicking and clacking of 
               metal on metal. ALMA assembles her rifle with lightning speed. 
               Still FUMBLING with their rifles, the other recruits stare 
               amazed at Alma. Judge checks the stopwatch... TWENTY SEVEN 
               SECONDS. Looking up, Judge and TYRONE'S EYES MEET.

               Judge hawks RED BOOKS to park goers, engaging them in pro 
               panther banter. Black folk move away from him when they spot 
               BRIMMER, an obvious cop, striding toward Judge.

                                     BRIMMER
                         You're Judge right? We need to talk.

                                     JUDGE
                         I don't know you and I got nothing 
                         to say to you.

                                     BRIMMER
                              (flashing his badge)
                         Yeah you do. It's up to you either 
                         here or downtown.

               Giving up, Judge walks with Brimmer listening as the cop 
               talks.

               Huey's COOKING BREAKFAST for the kids as Alma, Tyrone and 
               Little Bobby serve up bowls of porridge.

               Passing the munching kids, Judge -- obviously excited -- 
               moves over to Huey.

                                     JUDGE
                              (sotto voce)
                         They tried to recruit me. Just like 
                         you figured.

               Tyrone looks over,FROWNING. Huey signals him that everything's 
               cool.

                                     HUEY
                              (joking loudly)
                         You're a little old to be a school 
                         boy aren't you brother.
                              (whispering)
                         Cool it! You're probably not the 
                         only one they've gone after. Stall a 
                         little so they believe you're for 
                         real. Make them trust you.
                              (raising his voice)
                         Hey Tyrone, you figure feeding our 
                         children is gonna make The Man jumpy?

                         Black people getting uppity, feeding 
                         their children breakfast, taking 
                         their destiny into their own hands. 
                         What's this world coming to?

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               TITLE: RICHMOND CALIFORNIA, APRIL 1, 1967

               Pursued, a thin Black man -- DENZIL DOWELL -- LIMPS painfully 
               past. TWO COPS, guns drawn, run after him.

                                     COP #1
                         Hands up, you ain't going nowhere.

               Faced with a BLIND ALLEY, Dowell RAISES his hands. The cops 
               close in.

                                     DENZIL
                         I wasn't going nowhere in the first 
                         place. I ain't done shit.

                                     COP #2
                         "Done shit, SIR!!" Nigger don't 
                         move...

               Scared, Denzil instinctively BACKS AWAY from the cops.

                                     DENZIL
                         I ain't done...

               GUNFIRE rips through the alley.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LIVING ROOM - DOWELL HOME - DAY

               The room is filled with mourners. Shades are drawn but a 
               little sun brushes the PANTHERS LEATHER JACKETS. Denzil's 
               brother GEORGE, speaks softly to MOMMA DOWELL.

                                     GEORGE
                         Momma, these here are the Panthers I 
                         asked over from Oakland.

                                     MOMMA DOWELL
                         I thank you all for coming to grieve 
                         with us. The police won't tell us 
                         nothing.

                                     MOURNER
                         They been shooting Black men down 
                         around here like they're going out 
                         of style.

                                     MOMMA DOWELL
                              (breaking into tears)
                         My boy didn't do nothing. He didn't 
                         do nothing. Can't nobody do something.

                                     HUEY
                         We came to do something.

               EXT. RICHMOND RALLY - DAY

               Panthers, carrying GUNS, line both sides of the block. NEW 
               FACES can be seen with Judge, Alma, Cy, Tyrone, Little Bobby 
               and the others.

               A block or so distant, the SHERIFF'S OFFICE looms up.

               EXT. RICHMOND RALLY - DAY

               BOBBY SEALE shuttles back and forth distributing PROGRAMS 
               and LEAFLETS to a forest of outstretched Black hands.

               HUEY stands on top of a car, his strong voice ringing out 
               over the gathering.

                                     HUEY
                         ...The police report says he was 
                         shot three times but the coroner's 
                         report says quite clearly that Denzil 
                         Dowell was shot six times. And two 
                         of those shots were in his armpits. 
                         Brothers and Sisters you know why 
                         that is?
                              (raises his arms up)
                         Because Denzil had his hands up!!

                                     BOBBY SEALE
                              (to crowd)
                         No more police brutality! WHAT DO WE 
                         WANT?

                                     THE CROWD
                         JUSTICE!

               Frenzied hands grab all the PAMPHLETS from Bobby.

                                     SEALE
                              (to Judge)
                         More programs man!!! In the car.

               Judge moves away toward the PONTIAC.

               EXT. BOBBY'S CAR - DAY

               Judge grabs a pile of LEAFLETS off the seat. Turning back to 
               the rally, Judge comes nose to nose with BRIMMER.

                                     BRIMMER
                         Afternoon asshole... You shoulda 
                         told me about this. C'mon...

               EXT. RALLY - DAY

               Tyrone SEES Brimmer spin Judge around and cuff him.

                                     BOBBY SEALE
                         WHAT DO WE WANT?

                                     THE PANTHERS
                         JUSTICE!!!

               Tyrone NUDGES Huey, gesturing to Judge being led to Brimmer's 
               UNMARKED CAR.

                                     TYRONE
                         C'mon let's...

                                     HUEY
                         No! Just harassment. Can't let it 
                         stop this.
                              (an eye to car, then 
                              the crowd)
                         Brother we got momentum!

               Whipped up, the crowd YELLS as Tyrone looks perplexed.

                                     BOBBY
                         What do we want!!??

                                     THE CROWD
                         JUSTICE!

               REVEREND SLOCUM steps out, trying to calm the crowd.

                                     REVEREND SLOCUM
                         Amen! The Lord God Almighty be our 
                         witness. Let us bow our heads and 
                         pray for...

                                     BOBBY
                              (interrupting, raising 
                              his fist)
                         POWER TO THE PEOPLE!!!

                                     CROWD
                         POWER TO THE PEOPLE!

               The Panthers move into precise FORMATION. Huey and Bobby at 
               the front, the crowd moves toward the Sheriff's Office.

               EXT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY

               Tense, a DOUBLE LINE of police blocks the entrance. With the 
               crowd screaming for "JUSTICE!" and "BLACK POWER!" behind 
               them, Bobby and Huey step up to the Deputies.

                                     DEPUTY
                              (shoving Huey)
                         You're not getting in here with no 
                         gun.

               Huey SHOVES the cop back. The line of cops BRISTLES.

                                     HUEY
                         This firearm is being carried in 
                         plain view and is therefore perfectly 
                         legal according to California 
                         statute...

                                     COP
                         Over my dead body.

               Huey steps back and Clack!, jerks a ROUND into the gun. A 
               HUSH falls over the crowd. The POLICE raise their weapons.

                                     HUEY
                         That's your call pig.

               Rev. Slocum puts a steadying hand on Huey's arm.

                                     REV. SLOCUM
                              (to cops)
                         We come for justice, not bloodshed 
                         but don't be pushing us too far.

               Tense moments pass. Huey looks over at MOMMA DOWELL, reading 
               the concern in her eyes.

               Then, Huey and Bobby RAISE their weapons up, PASSING THEM to 
               the police. Unarmed, The Panthers enter the building.

               INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY

               Surrounded by deputies, Bobby and Huey confront the smug 
               SHERIFF.

                                     BOBBY
                         Bled to death!?!? The Coroner's report 
                         says he was shot to death. We demand 
                         a grand jury investigation in the 
                         death of Denzil Dowell and the pattern 
                         of brutality against the Black 
                         citizens of Richmond.

                         The Police department has conducted 
                         its own inquest and concluded that 
                         no misconduct occurred. As for a 
                         "pattern of brutality..." The charge 
                         is ridiculous.

                                     HUEY
                         Then what do you call four dead Black 
                         men in six months?!

                                     SHERIFF
                         I call it the police doing there 
                         duty under the law. You got a problem 
                         with that... take it to the 
                         legislature but get the hell out of 
                         my office.

               EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

               Brimmer's UNMARKED CAR sits in front of the tattered building 
               near the heart of Oakland.

               INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

               JUDGE -- handcuffed to a chair in the vast lofty space -- 
               looks like he's been through the wringer. BRIMMER, smoking 
               vehemently, hovers over him.

                                     BRIMMER
                         So... we understand each other Judge?

                                     JUDGE
                              (sullen)
                         Yeah.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE WAREHOUSE - DAY

               RODGERS watches Judge and Brimmer from the SHADOWS.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

               Brimmer UNCUFFS Judge from the chair.

                                     BRIMMER
                         Alright then.

               Judge STANDS a little shakily. Brimmer slides a BUSINESS 
               CARD in his pocket.

                                     BRIMMER
                         I expect to hear from you soon. If 
                         Huey Newton takes a crap, I want to 
                         know how big it was. Otherwise I'm 
                         gonna come looking for you. And I 
                         won't be as "friendly" as today.

                                     JUDGE
                         I got you.

               Judge turns to leave. Brimmer stops him

                                     BRIMMER
                         You just remember one thing Judge. 
                         You've got a lot at stake. And The 
                         Panthers are gonna lose. Question 
                         is, are you gonna lose along with 
                         them? Your future? Your mother? Think 
                         about it.

               Judge leaves. Brimmer takes a long drag of his cigarette, 
               STARING at RODGERS.

               EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               Half a step out the door, Judge THROWS Brimmer's CARD away.

               EXT. DE FEMERY PARK - DAY

               A combination BARBECUE/AWARENESS RALLY covers the park. 
               Panthers and just plain neighborhood folk eat, drink and 
               talk. Judge - a worried look on his face -- walks by.

               Huey's on the podium, speaking clearly and passionately.

                                     HUEY
                         As soon as black people exercise 
                         their rights to bear arms and defend 
                         themselves the pigs want to change 
                         the law. We're not going to make it 
                         easy for them to have unarmed targets. 
                         Now, you all have a good time cause 
                         this here's our community and it is 
                         a beautiful thing.
                              (raising his fist)
                         Power to the people.

               Pulsing MUSIC kicks in as Huey steps from the stage.

               EXT. DE FEMERY PARK - SIDE OF THE STAGE - DAY

               Huey joins a meeting in progress with Tyrone, Alma and Bobby, 
               who's particularly edgy.

                                     HUEY
                         This brothers is gonna be a colossal 
                         event. We'll shut the mother down 
                         right at the capitol, in front of 
                         the cameras.
                              (annoyed off Bobby's 
                              pacing)
                         Will you cool it? What's up man? 
                         What it be Bobby?

                                     BOBBY
                         What it be is, You aren't coming 
                         with us.

                                     HUEY
                         What? We're the leadership, you and 
                         me. There ain't enough of us to...

                                     BOBBY
                         That's just it Huey. The pigs don't 
                         know how many Panthers there are. 
                         Both of us show and they might start 
                         putting 2 and 2 together. We're not 
                         even two hundred strong yet... but 
                         we got 'em guessing thousands.

                                     HUEY
                         I hear you. Alright. I'll go, you 
                         stay.

               Admiring, Bobby shakes his head.

                                     BOBBY
                         Huey... We took a vote. You're still 
                         on probation. We can't risk you. 
                         Things is starting to get hot. Go 
                         mow yo momma's lawn like you promised.

               Huey's TENSES, ready to argue. Then he SPOTS Judge. A LOOK 
               passes between them.

                                     HUEY
                         Alright, I'll stay. Judge, I want 
                         to...

                                     TYRONE
                              (to Judge)
                         Where you been? I saw the cops 
                         rousting you at the rally.

                                     JUDGE
                         Aw... uh... it's was just harassment. 
                         My driver's license expired.

                                     HUEY
                         Chickenshits, they're grabbing at 
                         anything.

               Huey leads Judge away, Tyrone WATCHES them closely, very 
               suspicious.

               EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE PARK - DAY

               Huey's charged, talking fast to Judge.

                                     HUEY
                         What's the pig's name?

                                     JUDGE
                         Brimmer.

                                     HUEY
                              (very serious)
                         You got to keep very cool on this. 
                         Icy god damn cool. Cause baby, you 
                         just became the strongest weapon we 
                         got. Let me guess, he wants you to 
                         call him, tell him what we're doing.

                                     JUDGE
                         Yeah.

                                     HUEY
                         And you're gonna do just that. But 
                         I'll tell you what to feed the pig. 
                         You alright with this?

                                     JUDGE
                         Yeah... I guess. Any of other Panthers 
                         know about this?

               Huey just looks at Judge silently.

                                     JUDGE
                         Man, this shit's pretty thick.

                                     HUEY
                         You got that right. And brother, I 
                         got a feeling it's going to get a 
                         whole lot thicker.

               EXT. LEGISLATURE BUILDING - DAY

               TITLE: SACRAMENTO CALIFORNIA MAY 2, 1967

               Governor RONALD REAGAN stands on the Capitol lawn speaking 
               to THE FUTURE LEADERS -- a teenage group.

               Suddenly, THE PANTHERS pull up, stepping out of their cars, 
               ARMED, clad in black leather. CHAOS erupts.

               Bodyguards whisk Reagan away as a swarm of NEWS CREWS converge 
               on the Panthers. CAMERAS flanked around him, a REPORTER shoves 
               a microphone in Bobby's face.

                                     NEWSMAN
                         Is this a militant action? Are the 
                         Panthers storming the Capitol?

                                     BOBBY
                         No!!! Definitely not!!!
                              (to the news camera)
                         We are here to send a message. The 
                         Black Panther Party for Self Defense 
                         calls upon the American people in 
                         general and Black people in particular 
                         to take careful note of the racist 
                         California Legislature now considering 
                         the Mulford Act, which is aimed at 
                         keeping Black people disarmed and 
                         powerless while racist police agencies 
                         throughout the country intensify the 
                         terror, brutality, murder and 
                         repression of Black people.

               INT. LEGISLATURE - DAY

               It's hard to tell who there's more of -- Panthers or reporters -- 
               as the chaotic circus enters a LONG CORRIDOR.

               Seale's in the lead, with Little Bobby, Alma and Tyrone 
               following. Disoriented, they CLIMB stairs, continuing down 
               another CORRIDOR. A GUARD at a DOORWAY starts to freak.

                                     GUARD
                         You can't come in here!

                                     BOBBY
                         We are here to observe the Assembly. 
                         You will not stop us.

                                     GUARD
                         This door leads to the Assembly floor, 
                         it's closed to the public. You have 
                         to go to the Visitor's Gallery, 
                         it's...

               The guard TURNS TO POINT, Seale twists to follow his finger. 
               Reporters swing around. A crewman BUMPS into the guard. CHAOS. 
               The entourage PANICS, stumbling through the door. A mass of 
               Panthers and reporters spill into...

               INT. ASSEMBLY ROOM FLOOR - DAY

               Pro Tem Speaker Carlos Bee's mouth drops as a noisy mass of 
               Panthers and reporters careens into the chambers.

               Swiftly the rat pack of reporters BACKS AWAY, leaving the 
               Panthers, armed and confused, in the MIDDLE OF THE ROOM.

               SECURITY GUARDS converge on the Panthers.

               FOOTAGE

               Camera pans up from lawnmower to Huey's face.

                                                                  FADE INTO

               US and International HEADLINES scream the story. "New York 
               Times," France's "Le Figaro, Italy's "Il Giornale." The 
               Panthers have just become a worldwide phenomenon.

                                     PROSECUTOR
                              (over)
                         Tell the court Mr. Seale are you 
                         proud to be the co-founder of the 
                         Panthers, an anti-white movement.

                                     BOBBY
                              (over)
                         The Black Panther Party is not anti-
                         white, you cannot fight racism with 
                         racism.

               APPLAUSE rings out.

                                     JUDGE
                              (over)
                         Gentlemen, please approach the bench.

               The Judge's GAVEL BANGS.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Bobby, Huey, Prosecutors, Defenders and the Judge yell. GAVEL 
               still banging, a rapid-fire PLEA BARGAIN is underway.

                         My clients broke no law. It was an 
                         accident, a wrong turn. Besides, the 
                         guns were not illegal. Dismissal!

                         They will be as soon as the Mulford 
                         act passes. Six Months for everyone!

               Huey SHAKES his head at the Defense Attorney.

                                     PROSECUTOR
                         Okay, last offer. Ninety days, no 
                         felony charges, just a disturbing 
                         the peace.

               Huey NODS.

                         Deal!

                                     PROSECUTOR
                         Not so fast. But only if he
                              (points to Bobby)
                         and one of his lieutenants agree to 
                         six months.

                                     HUEY
                         You got six months to donate to the 
                         party, Bobby?

                         You know it brother.

               INT. HOOVER'S OFFICE - DAY

               The TAPE MACHINE rolls as a very agitated FBI director growls 
               into the phone.

                                     RODGERS
                              (over)
                         ...at least that takes Bobby Seale 
                         off the street...

                         Not good enough Rodgers. Not good 
                         enough at all. Black terrorists on 
                         the floor of a State Capitol. I will 
                         not say this again, these Negro 
                         Commies are to be stopped and now. 
                         You tear them down. Either from the 
                         outside or the inside.

                         Work harder. And get me some results. 
                         Those Black Bastards could be up to 
                         anything.

               EXT. MARKET STREET - NIGHT

               Finished with traffic duty Judge walks home. He passes 
               BRIMMER'S CAR at the curb.

                                     BRIMMER
                         C'mon we're going for a ride...

               EXT. BAY BRIDGE - NIGHT

               Brimmer's car pulls onto the bridge.

               INT. BRIMMER'S CAR - NIGHT

               Brimmer lights a cigarette angrily.

                                     BRIMMER
                         Why didn't you tell us about the 
                         party you boys were planning at the 
                         capitol?

                                     JUDGE
                         Shit man. It was... you know 
                         spontaneous.

                                     BRIMMER
                         Spontaneous my ass!! You told the 
                         press and you don't tell me. Remember 
                         you're working for us.

                                     JUDGE
                         Yeah... whatever you say.

                                     BRIMMER
                         Are you fucking with me? You smartass 
                         piece of shit...

               EXT. BAY BRIDGE - NIGHT

               Brimmer's car SWERVES pulling over in the MIDDLE of the 
               bridge. Playing angry cop to hilt, Brimmer jumps out.

                                     BRIMMER
                         Get out of the car.

                                     JUDGE
                         What's with you?

                                     BRIMMER
                         Get out of the fucking car.

               Judge obeys. Brimmer produces HANDCUFFS. He CUFFS Judge.

                                     BRIMMER
                         "Whatever you say, Inspector Brimmer." 
                         Fucking a right pal. Time you got 
                         your wiry head on straight.

               Brimmer grabs the front of Judge's shirt, PUSHING him hard 
               against the railing. It's a hellish drop. Brimmer pushes 
               harder. Judge's FEET scramble for purchase.

                                     JUDGE
                         What are you crazy?

                                     BRIMMER
                         Do you know how easy it would be for 
                         you to just disappear. Shit, you 
                         wouldn't even wash up for weeks. Do 
                         you fucking understand?
                              (still pushing)
                         I want you to move your ass outta 
                         neutral. I want a bunch of Panthers 
                         served up on a fucking plate. I want 
                         you to set 'em up... armed robbery!!

                                     JUDGE
                         I can't... they don't operate that 
                         way...

                                     BRIMMER
                         Fuck how they operate. Just do it. 
                         like your man says, "By any means 
                         necessary."

               Brimmer UNCUFFS Judge, stuffing an ENVELOPE OF MONEY in his 
               pocket.

                                     BRIMMER
                         Alright then. Here's a little help 
                         on your tuition. Get back in the 
                         car.

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               In UNIFORM, proud -- Tyrone and Cy walk down the street toward 
               Cy and Judge's APARTMENT.

                                     TYRONE
                         Where the hell's Judge anyway?

                                     CY
                         Between school and the Panthers, 
                         he's been running raw. I never see... 
                         Aw shit...

               Cy catches SOMETHING happening across the street.

               EXT. CY'S POV - ACROSS THE STREET - NIGHT

               SABU makes a furtive EXCHANGE with a young BLACK KID.

               EXT. JUDGE AND CY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Tyrone sees what Cy's looking at.

                                     TYRONE
                         You want a hand?

                                     CY
                              (tossing Tyrone KEYS)
                         No... go on up. I been kicking his 
                         narrow ass since high school.

               Cy trots across the street. A WHITE GIRL walks his way.

                                     WHITE GIRL
                         What you got to sell?

                                     CY
                              (rolling his eyes)
                         Lady, every Black man you lay eyes 
                         on ain't a dope dealer.

               INT. JUDGE AND CY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Tyrone waits inside the messy apartment. Suddenly he spots 
               JUDGE'S CLOTHES hanging over a chair. A moment passes. Then 
               Tyrone, begins RIFLING through a pair PANTS.

               He checks Judge's WALLET. Pulling out a DRIVER'S LICENSE, 
               Tyrone's finger traces the EXPIRATION DATE: 5/20/69.

                                     TYRONE
                              (to himself)
                         "My license was expired" Yeah, right.

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               Cy's got SABU against the wall, hissing into his face.

                                     CY
                         I ain't gonna tell you no more. No 
                         pushing in the neighborhood, 
                         especially not on my fucking street. 
                         You're killing your own people 
                         asshole.

                                     SABU
                         Man, fuck you!!!

                                     CY
                         No Fuck you!!!

               Cy SLUGS Sabu hard in the gut, dropping him to the ground.

                                     CY
                         I ain't playing Sabu. You keep on 
                         like this and I'm going to bust you 
                         up.

               Shaking his head in disgust, Cy heads toward home.

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               Holding his belly, Sabu catches his breath. SHOES appear in 
               front of him, shiny COP SHOES. It's SGT. SCHRECK.

                                     SABU
                         Aww man...

                                     SCHRECK
                         Those Panthers are turning into real 
                         shitheels ain't they...

               Schreck REACHES DOWN, helping Sabu. Sabu's amazed at the 
               "Good Cop" routine.

                                     SABU
                         Yeah, they're motherfuckers, all 
                         high and mighty.

                                     SCHRECK
                         You shouldn't take that. If I was 
                         you...
                              (an edge of violence)
                         I'd stand up for myself, if you know 
                         what I mean.

               INT. JUDGE AND CY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               CY looks around the empty space.

                                     CY
                         Tyrone? Shit, where'd you go?.

               INT. PANTHER MEETING - NIGHT

               Room filled with all the PANTHERS and more than a few NEW 
               FACES, Huey stands at the podium, filled with purpose.

                                     HUEY
                         Look around you, brothers and sisters, 
                         we're building the numbers. New 
                         members coming in almost every day. 
                         I'd like to introduce one of them. 
                         He's is the author of "Soul on Ice," 
                         a respected journalist and I'm proud 
                         to say the newly appointed Minister 
                         of Information for the Black Panther 
                         Party. Brothers and sisters, Eldridge 
                         Cleaver.

               Applause rises as the tall, black man from before, still 
               wear SUNGLASSES, strides to the podium.

                                     ELDRIDGE
                         Brothers and Sisters! You are all 
                         well aware of the chains that we as 
                         a people bear. The chains of slavery, 
                         of second class citizenship. But 
                         there are other, more invisible 
                         chains. The chains of not speaking 
                         your mind. The chains of all the 
                         words left unsaid out of fear of 
                         reprisal by The Man. The silencing 
                         of our Black voices. I'm here to 
                         tell you that we have a voice.
                              (a smile)
                         And I'd like to prove to you. All of 
                         you, repeat after me.

               SILENCE fills the room, everyone hangs on Eldridge's words.

                                     ELDRIDGE
                         Fuck Ronald Reagan.

               Smiles hit the assembled faces. Judge chuckles.

                                     ELDRIDGE
                         I'm serious. Repeat after me. Fuck 
                         Ronald Reagan.

                                     ASSEMBLY
                         Fuck Ronald Reagan!!!

                                     ELDRIDGE
                         Feels good don't it. Amazing how 
                         saying your mind can free your soul.

                                     ASSEMBLY
                         Fuck Ronald Reagan!!

               Powerful and playful, the CHANT course through the room. 
               Everyone's SMILING, reveling in the camaraderie.

               EXT. OUTSIDE THE MEETING - NIGHT

               Meeting over, Huey, Judge and Tyrone watch the room clear. 
               Tyrone's EDGY, trying to get Huey alone.

                                     TYRONE
                         Huey man I got to talk with you...

                         So talk...

                                     TYRONE
                              (looking at Judge)
                         Alone...

                                     HUEY
                         Look... can we deal with this 
                         tomorrow... I'm tired...

               Huey walks away, leaving Tyrone glaring at Judge.

               EXT. BAY BRIDGE - DAY

               Sun streams through the girders, shining its light equally 
               on both sides of the bridge.

               INT. HUEY'S VW - DAY

               Upset and in deeper than he ever expected, Judge smacks the 
               dashboard in frustration.

                                     HUEY
                         Listen Judge, Oakland's Panther 
                         International Headquarters. We shut 
                         the Pig's infiltration down here, 
                         they're gonna think twice about 
                         running their games on other chapters.

                                     JUDGE
                         Huey, man who's gonna straighten out 
                         the brothers if they get on my ass?

                                     HUEY
                         Like the manual says, "Information 
                         is...

                                     HUEY AND JUDGE
                              (in unison)
                         disseminated on a need-to-know basis."

                                     HUEY
                         Yeah, and what I need to know, is 
                         what exactly your gonna do about 
                         feeding the pigs a bust?

                                     JUDGE
                         I don't know man. I don't know. That 
                         reminds me.
                              (passing an ENVELOPE 
                              to Huey)
                         Another little donation from the 
                         police.

                                     HUEY
                         If the pigs only knew they were 
                         subsidizing The Panthers...

                                     JUDGE
                         Yeah well, they want a lot for their 
                         money. They want a felony, preferably 
                         with "violent intent." We've got to 
                         give them something. They'll kill me 
                         if I don't. And the Panthers are 
                         going to kill me if I do. I'm scared.

                                     HUEY
                         Me too. That's why I fight so hard.

               EXT. GROVE STREET - DUSK (MAGIC HOUR)

               Something's CHANGED in the neighborhood, the Panther presence 
               seems to have given the street focus. Folks gather nearby, 
               hanging enjoying the sunshine.

               Bo Diddley's "Oh Baby" grooves from a radio.

               CY -- amped on the movement -- walks out of the PANTHER HQ. 
               He runs into JUDGE out on the street.

                                     CY
                         Hey, it's the invisible man. Brother 
                         where you been?

                                     JUDGE
                              (gripping Cy's hand)
                         Cy... I ain't even sure.

                                     CY
                         C'mon we'll walk and talk...

                                     JUDGE
                              (pointing inside)
                         Naw... I gotta...

                                     CY
                         I hear you. I'll catch you in a bit. 
                         Feeling cooped up in there, you know?

               Cy steps out into Grove street. Judge WATCHES him go.

               EXT. MARKET STREET - DUSK

               Cy cruises the street. People check out the UNIFORM, some 
               even offer up a "Right on." or flash the fist salute.

               ROSE -- staked out on his steps -- beckons Cy over.

                                     ROSE
                         Hey... Cy... what now you a righteous 
                         Panther man, you too uppity to drink 
                         with us?

                                     CY
                         You know that's bullshit.

               Rose passes him the BOTTLE, Cy takes a small swig. Immediately 
               his FACE PUCKERS.

                                     CY
                         Aaaah, Bitter Motherfucker... I almost 
                         forgot how nasty that shit is.

                                     ROSE
                         Well don't go forgetting your friends.

                                     CY
                              (leaving)
                         Ain't gonna happen, stay cool.

                                     ROSE
                         You know it. Stay Black...

                                     CY
                         Damn straight.

               EXT. 50TH STREET - NIGHT

               Rounding a corner Cy spots SABU -- yep, he's still dealing. 
               Rolling his eyes, Cy steps toward him.

                                     CY
                         I swear, you gotta be a card-carrying 
                         member of the stupid revolution.

               Sabu's SCARED, he backs away from Cy. Customers SCATTER.

                                     SABU
                         Motherfucker... you stay away...

                                     CY
                         Look this is bull...

               Dumb, cowardly, SABU comes up with a PISTOL. He FIRES it 
               into Cy, not even aiming, just fear pulling a trigger. Once, 
               Twice, Three times.

               Cy takes a PAIR of BULLETS straight to the chest. Blood flecks 
               his surprised face.

                                     CY
                              (amazed)
                         ...shit...

               Cy COLLAPSES onto the pavement as SABU runs away.

               INT. PANTHER HQ - NIGHT

               Alone in the main room, Judge works a MIMEOGRAPH MACHINE, 
               running off more Ten Point Programs.

               TYRONE comes in through the back door, startling Judge.

                                     TYRONE
                         C'mere...

               EXT. ALLEY BEHIND PANTHER HQ - NIGHT

               Carter has an obviously terrified YOUNG PANTHER up against 
               the wall as Judge and Tyrone step into the half light.

                                     TYRONE
                         Signed up 'bout a month ago. Says 
                         his name's Matty. I call him spy!

               Wham!! Tyrone SLUGS Matty right in the gut.

                                     TYRONE
                         Motherfucker gave the pigs the license 
                         numbers of every Panther car.

               Tyrone grabs Matty's INDEX FINGER.

                                     TYRONE
                              (to Matty)
                         This the finger you ratted on us 
                         with?

               CRACK!! Tyrone jerks Matty's finger back BREAKING IT.

               Repulsed, Judge turns back inside.

               INT. PANTHER HQ - NIGHT

               Tyrone bolts in after Judge.

                                     TYRONE
                         What? You don't like to see a traitor 
                         get hurt? I wonder why that is?

                                     JUDGE
                         If you got something to say, say it.

                                     TYRONE
                         Anything happens to Huey it ain't 
                         gonna be a finger. I'll...

               GENE -- eyes lit up with anger and fear -- bursts in.

                                     GENE
                         It's Cy... he's been shot.

               Bam! Judge SNAPS pushing Tyrone away and bolting out the 
               door. Tyrone follows.

               EXT. 50TH STREET - NIGHT

               Cy WRITHES in agony on the pavement, in a pool of blood. 
               Judge kneels down next to him, cradling him. Cy's COUGHING, 
               trying to talk.

                                     JUDGE
                         Cy... Cy... Oh shit man... who did 
                         this to you. Was it the pigs?

                                     CY
                         N... N...... Not... Oh.

               Cy DIES right there in Judge's arms. Something twists in 
               Judge's heart, the struggle has just become very personal.

               INT. JUDGE AND CY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               His shirt covered with his dead friend's blood, Judge sits 
               at the table, destroyed.

                                     JUDGE
                         Motherfuckers...

               Judge grabs the phone, punching out a number.

                                     BRIMMER
                         Inspector Brimmer

                                     JUDGE
                         Yeah, it's me.

                                     BRIMMER
                         Judge, hold on, is your phone safe?

                                     JUDGE
                         Who fucking cares? You cops killed 
                         Cy. And before you bastards kill 
                         anyone else, I'll give you your 
                         fucking set up. That make you 
                         happy??!!

                                     BRIMMER
                         Judge, calm down.

               Judge grits his teeth.

                                     JUDGE
                         I'm calm. I'm calm. You just shut 
                         the fuck up. And listen...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ROAD - DAY

               The PANTHER VAN heads down the road, sticking out like a 
               sore thumb.

               EXT. ROAD - DAY

               POV: Through the windshield of a police vehicle. The VAN 
               crosses the screen right to left. Starting forward, the police 
               car following at a safe distance.

               INT. PANTHER VAN - DAY

               TYRONE'S driving as Judge sits -- preoccupied -- in the 
               passenger seat. Suspicion hovers between the two. GENE's in 
               back next to a load of NEWSPAPERS.

                                     TYRONE
                              (eyeing Judge)
                         What's up with you?

                                     JUDGE
                         Nothing.

                                     TYRONE
                         You got something on your mind... 
                         "brother."

                                     JUDGE
                         Yeah, "brother" My best friend is 
                         stone dead.

               The words cool Tyrone off a bit.

                                     TYRONE
                         Sorry man...

                                     JUDGE
                         S'alright. I'm sorry too. Shit, I 
                         gotta take a leak... Pull over at 
                         that gas station.

               EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

               The VAN pulls into the TINY station. Judge's hops out heading 
               inside.

               EXT. BRIMMER'S CAR - DAY

               BRIMMER watches the scene through BINOCULARS. He hisses into 
               a WALKIE TALKIE.

                                     BRIMMER
                         It's going down... Right on time.

               INT. GAS STATION - DAY

               An OLDER MAN sits placidly behind the counter as Judge enters, 
               the door ringing a BELL.

                                     OLDER MAN
                         If you want gas my nephew...

                                     TYRONE
                              (interrupting)
                         Where's your bathroom...

                                     OLDER MAN
                         Out back.

               Judge stands, stock still, sweating. The Man cocks his head, 
               strangely.

               Adrenaline raging, Judge PULLS a GUN.

                                     JUDGE
                         Open the god damn register!!!!

               INT. PANTHER VAN - DAY

               Impatient Tyrone drums his fingers on the dash.

                                     TYRONE
                         How long can a piss take?

               Gene SHRUGS.

                                     GENE
                         Hey... I got one for ya. Two brothers 
                         are taking a leak off the Bay Bridge. 
                         First one says, "Damn, this water's 
                         cold." Other one just smiles and 
                         goes, "Yeah and deep too."

               Tyrone CHUCKLES, suddenly his face DROPS.

                                     TYRONE
                         What the fuck?

               EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

               SIRENS LIGHTS. Half a dozen POLICE CARS swoop down on the 
               filling station.

               Fast, like storm troopers, the cops pull TYRONE and GENE 
               from the van, roughing them up.

                                     BRIMMER
                              (pushing through)
                         Watch the faces Goddamit!! We want 
                         them recognizable...

               Tyrone SHOVES a cop away from him. Brimmer DRAWS his .38, 
               training it calmly between Tyrone's eyes.

                                     BRIMMER
                         Easy boy... Or I will blow you right 
                         away...

                                     TYRONE
                              (putting up his hands)
                         We haven't done nothing! Why don't 
                         you fascist pigs stop harassing us?

                                     BRIMMER
                         Harassment my ass, pal. You just 
                         stuck up this station. We got a 
                         witness...

                                     TYRONE
                         What kind of bullshit...

                                     ROOKIE COP
                         I'll go get the other one.

                                     BRIMMER
                         No!!! Get the bastards cuffed, I got 
                         him...

               EXT. BACK OF STATION - DAY

               Brimmer dashes around the corner. He bangs on the BATHROOM 
               DOOR. Nothing. He puts his mouth to the door.

                                     BRIMMER
                              (hoarse whisper)
                         It's me Brimmer. Get the fuck out of 
                         here.

               Judge BOLTS out of the toilet. Brimmer FIRES over his head. 
               Judge runs fast through the weeds, up the hill.

               THE ROOKIE COP sprints around the corner, AIMING at Judge. 
               Brimmer BUMPS him. The shot fires wide.

               Judge DISAPPEARS over the hill.

               EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

               REPORTERS swarm the steps. DORSETT, basking in the camera's 
               glow, smugly addresses them.

                                     DORSETT
                         Today's arrest exposes the Black 
                         Panthers for what they truly are... 
                         common criminals. Yes, we have a 
                         group of the so called revolutionaries 
                         in custody right now. Caught red 
                         handed robbing a local business. And 
                         as soon as our witness gives us a 
                         positive identification, we'll file 
                         charges of armed robbery with intent 
                         to kill...

                                     NEWSMAN
                         Sir... was anybody hurt?

                                     DORSETT
                              (turning back inside)
                         I have no further comment.

               INT. DORSETT'S OFFICE - DAY

               Flushed with victory, Dorsett strides into his office. Pissed, 
               Rodgers looks up from a TELETYPE.

                                     DORSETT
                         I want it duly noted, that this 
                         operation was entirely under the 
                         auspices of the Oakland Police 
                         Department. The FBI doesn't have a 
                         monopoly on agents infiltrating enemy 
                         organizations, my friend. As I've 
                         said before, Agent Rodgers, we have 
                         things under control in our city...

                                     RODGERS
                         Are you finished?

                                     DORSETT
                         No I'm not. I'd like to say, frankly 
                         and off the record, that I resent 
                         the Bureau's presence here. "Advisory 
                         Basis" or not. And, once we get these 
                         boys put away and the Panthers 
                         permanently discredited, I'd 
                         appreciate it if you'd leave us to 
                         take care of our own. Now I'm 
                         finished.

               Rodgers fixes Dorsett with a stony glare.

               EXT. SEEDY STREET - NIGHT

               Fast, head down, JUDGE moves through Oakland's skid row, 
               heading for an ABANDONED GARAGE.

               INT. LINE UP ROOM - DAY

               Actually the line up room is two chambers. Dorsett and Rodgers 
               enter the smaller room. BRIMMER, haggard, smoking, beckons 
               Dorsett to a corner. Rodgers sticks by the door.

               Brimmer WHISPERS to Dorsett, we can't hear the conversation 
               but obviously The Chief doesn't like it.

               In the FOREGROUND, THE MAN from the gas station stands in 
               front of TWO WAY GLASS -- A UNIFORM cop at his side.

               TYRONE AND GENE stand on the line up platform on the opposite 
               side of the two way glass.

               Dorsett and Brimmer move to the man. We see now that he's 
               staring blankly at the Panthers.

                                     DORSETT
                         Brimmer, what are you telling me?

               The uniform cop WAVES his hand in front of the man's face.

                                     UNIFORMED COP
                         He's blind chief. Couldn't I.D. his 
                         own mother.

                                     BRIMMER
                              (sheepishly)
                         He just stands in for his nephew 
                         during lunch.

               Dorsett TURNS, locking eyes with Rodgers. Fixing Dorsett 
               with a WITHERING GLARE, Rodgers walks out the door.

               INT. ROSE'S GARAGE - DAY

               Rose's place -- the back of a chop shop -- is a forest of 
               BOTTLES and CAR SEATS. An OLD TV blares a NEWSCAST: "Panthers 
               Freed" complete with a PHOTO of Tyrone and Gene.

                                     ROSE
                         This cool the heat off you any?

                                     JUDGE
                         I don't know.
                              (rising)
                         But I'm sure I'll find out. Rose, 
                         you did me solid.

               Judge PULLS some BILLS from his pocket.

                                     ROSE
                         Unh... Unh Man... I don't take no 
                         money from friends that need help. 
                         Fuck no. What do you think I am a 
                         bum?

                                     JUDGE
                         Not at all.
                              (gripping Rose's hand)
                         I'll catch you later.

               Rose -- something big on his mind -- STOPS Judge at the door.

                                     ROSE
                         Judge... I... I shoulda told you 
                         this before but... well... fuck...

                                     JUDGE
                         What?

                                     ROSE
                         It was Sabu killed Cy.

                                     JUDGE
                         Where is he?.

                                     ROSE
                         Ain't no one seen him.

                                     JUDGE
                         Why didn't you tell me?

                                     ROSE
                         Didn't want folks to think I was a 
                         snitch. You know?

               PAIN creases Judge's face.

                                     JUDGE
                              (softly)
                         Yeah man... I know.

               INT. PRINTING PLANT - DAY

               The Panthers are celebrating. TYRONE and the others release 
               while the paper gets printed. BOB DYLAN's "Ballad of a Thin 
               Man" PLAYS. Huey, wine in one hand, grooves to the music

                                     HUEY
                              (to Tyrone)
                         Shit... check this out.

                                     SONG
                              (over)
                         ...something is happening here...

                                     HUEY
                         But you don't know what it is Mr. 
                         Jones. See Dylan is hip. The part 
                         about the geeks getting the worst 
                         jobs, that's like us, man. Black 
                         folks always get given the lowest 
                         shit.

                                     TYRONE
                              (with purpose)
                         Yeah man, but where's Judge?

                                     HUEY
                              (pointedly)
                         You know I think Brother Judge needs 
                         our support right now, not our 
                         suspicion
                              (picking up paper off 
                              the press)
                         This is beautiful man. Folks around 
                         here never read the truth like this 
                         before.

               TYRONE is just about to speak, when ELDRIDGE who's been 
               bustling around escorts Huey into a basket chair, replacing 
               his wine glass and paper with a spear and rifle. Tyrone stares 
               after them as ALMA comes over.

                                     HUEY
                         El Rage what's with all the Zulu 
                         shit?

                                     ELRIDGE
                         We can no longer let the white media 
                         control our image. We gotta let the 
                         people know what we are about 
                         ourselves.

                                     HUEY
                         That's what our newspaper will do.

                                     ELDRIDGE
                         But lots of our people don't read, 
                         man. They need strong imagery to 
                         help them out.

                                     HUEY
                         Yeah... then shouldn't this be all 
                         of us together.

                                     ELDRIDGE
                              (propping up a shield)
                         Trust me Huey, this picture will be 
                         worth a thousand words. Now have you 
                         given any thought to that Peace and 
                         Freedom Party thing. They really 
                         want to hook up with us. Do a rally 
                         together. Hell it'd broaden our base 
                         of visibility.

                                     HUEY
                         Yeah, but aligning with white 
                         organizations. I'm not sure now's 
                         the time.

                                     ELDRIDGE
                         The time, my friend, is what Sartre 
                         called, "the moment the match is 
                         being put to the fuse." Question is, 
                         is the hand holding that match gonna 
                         be black or white.

                                     HUEY
                         ...no full fledge alliance. But I 
                         think we should do a rally with them. 
                         Show that there's some common ground 
                         between Black and White. You all 
                         with that?
                              (everyone nods)
                         All right then Eldridge, set it up.

               EXT. ANTI WAR DEMONSTRATION - DAY

               TITLE: OAKLAND INDUCTION CENTER OCTOBER 20, 1967

               By far this is the largest rally we've seen. Police stand in 
               RIOT FORMATION as a HUGE CROWD looks up to a podium near the 
               center's steps.

                                     CROWD
                         Hell No! We won't go! Hell No! We 
                         won't go!!!

               HUEY, TYRONE, ALMA, ELDRIDGE and a contingent of Panthers 
               hold precise formation at the side of the platform as AVAKIAN, 
               a sandy haired young man finishes his speech.

                                     AVAKIAN
                         Not long ago, we came to these steps 
                         to protest. We were four thousand 
                         then. Tonight we are ten thousand.

               A HUGE ROAR rises from the crowd.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. JUDGE'S PLACE - DAY

               The ROAR continues over as Judge approaches his DOORWAY, a 
               CAR glides to the curb. BRIMMER -- eyes red-rimmed with hate -- 
               stares out.

               JUDGE BOLTS, running fast down an alleyway and turns the 
               corner. Screeching tires, two uniformed cops in a SQUAD CAR 
               blast out of nowhere, sealing the exit, weapons drawn.

               Brimmer PULLS UP on the curb. In seconds he's got Judge face 
               down on the hood, CUFFED.

               Brimmer SMACKS Judge's head against the car.

                                     BRIMMER
                         Thanks a lot Motherfucker, that blind 
                         man was real cute.

               Brimmer drags Judge toward an ALLEY.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ANTI WAR DEMONSTRATION - DAY

                                     AVAKIAN
                         Ten thousand different voices. All 
                         unified, saying one thing. That you 
                         cannot have an imperialistic war 
                         abroad and social peace at home. So 
                         with that unity, that purpose in 
                         mind... Ladies and Gentlemen I give 
                         you the Minister of Defense of the 
                         Black Panther Party -- Huey Newton.

               APPLAUSE.

                                     HUEY
                         Thank you. The Black Panther Party 
                         is proud to be here tonight. Here in 
                         front of this monument to oppression 
                         both at home and abroad. Not far 
                         from here, Brother Bobby Seale is 
                         locked down.

               Shouts go up, "Yeah Bobby!!" "Set the brother free!"

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ALLEY - DAY

               Brimmer pushes Judge up against the wall.

                                     HUEY
                              (over)
                         A victim of the tyranny we feel here 
                         at home.

               EXT. ANTI WAR DEMONSTRATION - DAY

                                     HUEY
                         That same tyranny is at work many 
                         miles from here. In Vietnam. Black 
                         men are dying there, white men are 
                         dying there. Yellow men are dying 
                         there. We're told they're dying in 
                         the name of freedom.
                              (a beat)
                         Freedom. Well, now if their blood's 
                         keeping us free. How come so many of 
                         us -- like Bobby -- are in jail. If 
                         they're dying so we can enjoy our 
                         rights, how come the police still 
                         kill us in the streets?

               Angry YELLS rise, agreeing with Huey.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ALLEY - DAY

               Brimmer lays into Judge, hitting him in the gut. Defenseless, 
               CUFFED, Judge takes each brutal punch.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ANTI-WAR DEMONSTRATION - DAY

                                     HUEY
                         So, when you think about it. The 
                         question we have to ask is... Why 
                         should the Black man go fight the 
                         Yellow man for the White man? It's 
                         that simple. The answer's simple 
                         too.
                              (a beat)
                         We shouldn't!

               THE CROWD CHEERS

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ALLEY - DAY

               CHEERS ringing out, Brimmer's hands work for pain.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                                     HUEY
                         The Black Panther Party is opposed 
                         to the war in Vietnam! We know our 
                         war is here. Against hard drugs in 
                         the community. Against unemployment. 
                         Against a system that beats a Black 
                         man in his home, then sends him to 
                         die in a foreign land. That my 
                         brothers and sisters, is our war.

               Ten thousand unite in THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ALLEY - DAY

               Crumpled on the ground, Judge's doubled up in pain. Brimmer 
               UNCUFFS him and WALKS AWAY. Over, the APPLAUSE rises to a 
               deafening pitch.

               INT. HALLWAY - DAY

               Brimmer stalks down the hall, unhappy. FBI guys in suits are 
               EVERYWHERE -- pulling teletypes, on the phones. They're like 
               an occupying army.

                                     BRIMMER
                              (passing a doorway)
                         What the fuck?

                                     RODGERS
                              (over)
                         Brimmer! Could you come in here 
                         please?

               INT. OFFICE - DAY

               Rodgers has set himself up in a command center. Across from 
               him DORSETT sits like a whipped dog.

                                     RODGERS
                         Sit down, This concerns you too.
                              (pulls out a Black 
                              Panther newspaper)
                         I don't need to say that your 
                         department's handling of the Black 
                         Panthers -- particularly Inspector 
                         Brimmer's "undercover operation" has 
                         been a complete travesty.

                                     BRIMMER
                         Just hold on a god damn minute. I...

               Ignoring Brimmer, Rodgers passes the PAPERS to Dorsett.

                                     RODGERS
                         These are memos from the commissioner, 
                         the mayor and Hoover himself, putting 
                         the Black Panthers and their 
                         subversive activities under the full 
                         jurisdiction of the Bureau.

                                     DORSETT
                              (reading)
                         Jesus...

                                     RODGERS
                         As far as Mr. Hoover is concerned 
                         the worst has happened, the Panthers 
                         have unified with other organizations -- 
                         most likely sponsored by communists -- 
                         to undermine the war in Vietnam.
                              (a beat)
                         By doing so, they have quite simply 
                         guaranteed their own extinction.

               Rodgers studies Dorsett and Brimmer's incredulous faces.

                                     RODGERS
                         Of course we welcome any cooperation 
                         the your department has to "offer..."

               TITLE: OAKLAND SATURDAY OCTOBER 28, 1967

               A SQUAD CAR sits, lights FLASHING, behind HUEY'S VOLKSWAGEN.

               The belligerent BABY-FACED COP from the showdown on Grove 
               Street -- settles his flashlight beam on HUEY.

               GENE, sitting next to Huey, looks very nervous.

                                     BABY FACED COP
                         Well, well, well, what do we have 
                         here, the great Huey P. Newton...
                              (a smile)
                         Get out of the car.

               Huey holds up his LAW BOOK.

                              (calmly and carefully)
                         California law does not require the 
                         driver to leave a vehicle, unless he 
                         is being placed under arrest...

                         Huey...

               Huey moves out of the car very, very slowly -- his life 
               depending on it.

                                     HUEY
                         I am not resisting arrest. Nor am I 
                         armed. Any use of force on your part 
                         is illegal...
                              (holding up BOOK)
                         according to California...

                         You can take that law book and shove 
                         it up your ass nigger...

               ANOTHER SQUAD CAR pulls up. A NERVOUS PATROLMAN gets out. 
               His hand HOVERS over his pistol.

                                     NERVOUS COP

               There's a SOUND, GENE'S getting out of the car.

                         You!!! Get the fuck back in...
                              (moves the gun)

               GUNFIRE rings out. Hitting Huey in the gut. BABY FACE, also 
               wounded, drops.

               The NERVOUS COP has freaked out and is shooting wildly. 
               Bleeding HUEY crawls toward BABY FACE'S GUN. He grabs it, 
               turning it on the NERVOUS COP.

               MORE GUNFIRE. Chaos. Screaming. Splattered with BLOOD, THE 
               LAW BOOK lies on the ground, bearing an inscription on the 
               flyleaf: HUEY P. NEWTON.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CORRIDOR - HOSPITAL - NIGHT

               Huey's HANDCUFFED to a GURNEY, being wheeled fast through 
               the hall. I.V.'s hang. Blood is everywhere. COPS hover 
               malevolently over his spread-eagled form.

               Cops COVER HUEY'S FACE with a towel, then start viciously 
               BEATING HUEY. Doctors and Nurses look on impotently.

               INT. PANTHER HQ - MORNING

               Tears streak Alma's face. TYRONE, JUDGE and the other Panthers 
               sit solemnly. NEWSPAPERS cover every surface blaring: COP 
               SLAIN PANTHER LEADER WOUNDED IN SHOOT-OUT.

               In the background, Panthers put Huey's WICKER CHAIR poster 
               in the window. Eldridge's got his ear glued to a PHONE.

                                     ELDRIDGE
                              (to the others)

                         Right with Bobby getting out, they 
                         try to put Huey in the gas chamber... 
                         Damn.

                                     LITTLE BOBBY
                         Please Huey stay alive

               INT. ALAMEDA COUNTY JAIL - DAY

               In a MOS sequence, JACKSON a Black Trustee leads Bobby Seale -- 
               dressed in STREET CLOTHES -- down the windy halls. Bobby 
               holds a FILE of RELEASE PAPERS.

               Seale comes to the doorway of the INFIRMARY. HUEY lies there, 
               beaten and bloody. The two men LOCK EYES, each raising a 
               FIST in salute.

               INT. AUDITORIUM - FREE HUEY MEETING - NIGHT

               Bobby enters. The auditorium is empty except for Cleaver, 
               Tyrone, and Little Bobby.

                                     BOBBY SEALE
                              (shocked)
                         Where's everybody?

                                     TYRONE
                         We had over a hundred people, just 
                         on the "Free Huey" Defense Committee 
                         alone until we chose a lawyer.

               CHARLES GARRY, a white man in a crumpled suit move across 
               the gym floor towards them.

                                     BOBBY SEALE
                         Can he free Huey?

                                     ELDRIDGE
                         If anybody can, he's the man.

               Bobby Seale SHAKES Garry's hand.

                                     BOBBY SEALE
                              (to the Panthers)
                         Brothers the struggle has begun... 
                         We need allies and we need 'em fast. 
                         Eldridge?

                                     ELDRIDGE
                         I'm on it...

               EXT. STEPS - ALAMEDA COUNTY JAIL - DAY

               TITLE: JANUARY 10, 1968

               Panther FLAGS fly -- now bearing the words "FREE HUEY." A 
               nonstop RALLY/VIGIL of Panthers and Black Folks covers the 
               steps. WHITE FOLKS wear "HONKIES FOR HUEY." buttons.

               Uniformed COPS stare out from the jail's GLASS DOORS.

                                     CROWD
                         Black is beautiful/FREE HUEY!/Set 
                         our warrior free/FREE HUEY!/Black is 
                         beautiful/FREE HUEY/Set our warrior 
                         free...

               Bobby Seale stands next to Eldridge and other BLACK ACTIVISTS 
               near a microphone. A very intense, wiry man in sunglasses 
               approaches the mike -- STOKELY CARMICHAEL.

               Carmichael's speaking style is unique, his slow low-key drawl 
               underscoring the incendiary nature of the words.

                                     CARMICHAEL
                         We say that Huey P. Newton is a 
                         prisoner of war. Many people say 
                         that that's not true. Or that the 
                         Party is exaggerating. I think it's 
                         clear, it's crystal clear that the 
                         United States has declared war on 
                         Black people. She did that when she 
                         took the first black man from Africa.

               The Crowd ROARS in approval, raising Black FISTS.

                                     CARMICHAEL
                         Now of course, she never came out 
                         and said the words, "I declare war 
                         on Black people. She did not do that. 
                         Well now, the United States to this 
                         day has not declared war on Vietnam, 
                         but there is Vietnam. They did not 
                         declare war on North Korea but they 
                         fought in North Korea. And they did 
                         not declare war against the Indians. 
                         They just wiped them out.

               MORE applause, even non-Panthers pick up on the message.

                                     CARMICHAEL
                         So we must define our position... We 
                         are at war. Huey P. Newton, Minister 
                         of Defense, is our leader. He is in 
                         jail. He is a prisoner of war. We 
                         must get him by any means necessary. 
                         If we cannot get him, we must, we 
                         must retaliate. Period.

               CHEERS, a CALL rises from the crowd -- plain in it's message: 
               "Free Huey." Over and over again. "Free Huey."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PANTHER HQ - DAY

               A bee hive of activity, Bobby mans the phone. Tyrone, Alma 
               and Judge open a BOX -- containing FREE HUEY BUTTONS.

                                     ELDRIDGE
                         Man, we can't make enough of these 
                         things. We got movie stars calling 
                         up, asking how they can help. I tell 
                         you sister it's nation time...

                                     ALMA
                         Yeah I wish we didn't need no pins... 
                         Wish Huey was here right now...

                                     JUDGE
                              (softly)
                         Me too...

               Tyrone fixes Judge with an INQUISITIVE STARE.

                                     TYRONE
                         You sure about that... brother?

               At the door LITTLE BOBBY -- amazed -- YELLS to the others.

                                     LITTLE BOBBY
                         Brothers!!! Sisters! Come here. This, 
                         you gotta see...

               EXT. PANTHER OFFICE - DAY

               A GOOD SIZED NEIGHBORHOOD group caries FOOD inside. OLDER 
               MEN, kids, BOBBY HUTTON'S MOM. In the front walks RITA.

               Judge pushes to the front, his jaw drops. He exchanges a 
               probing LOOK with his mom.

                                     RITA
                         You all been working so much... you 
                         know. Me and some others thought you 
                         might be missing the home cooking...

               MRS. HUTTON taps a finger to his "Free Huey" button.

                                     MRS. HUTTON
                         Hey... you got any more of those...

               LAUGHTER rises as the Panthers usher their folks in.

               INT. RODGERS OFFICE - DAY

               Rodgers, obviously getting an earful over the phone, splutters 
               excuses and explanations.

                                     RODGERS
                         Granted, the Free Huey thing has 
                         become a bit of a rallying cry for 
                         the left...

                                     HOOVER
                              (over)
                         Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. 
                         Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where 
                         the hell do these guys come from?

                                     RODGERS
                         Well... like they say, there's a 
                         Panther born every minute in the 
                         ghetto. Uh... we seem to have 
                         "underestimated" the support of the 
                         Black community. It's their power 
                         base...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOOVER'S OFFICE - DAY

               Hoover takes a couple moments before saying his next words.

                                     HOOVER
                         Well, then we're going to take that 
                         power away from those bastards.

                                     RODGERS
                              (over)
                         You mean...

                         Yes, that's exactly what I mean. And 
                         Agent Rodgers?... This conversation 
                         never occurred.

               Hoover HANGS UP.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FISHING BOAT - DAY

               MEN wander the decks as RODGERS and DORSETT stare off the 
               bow at the Bay. TONY keep an eye on them from a distance.

                                     DORSETT
                         Rodgers... this is no good...

                                     RODGERS
                         Cut the crap, you've been taking the 
                         man's money for years. Now it's time 
                         you earned it.

               A booming VOICE grabs their attention.

                                     TRAFFICANTE
                              (over)
                         Gentlemen!!! Forgive me for keeping 
                         you.

               An immaculately dressed man -- LOUIS TRAFFICANTE -- steps 
               out. Smooth as silk, his every movement spells Mafia.

                                     TRAFFICANTE
                         Odd isn't it Chief Dorsett? No matter 
                         how much we try to deny it, we find 
                         ourselves on the same side of the 
                         coin. It's almost funny...

               Trafficante settles easily into a deck chair. Dorsett's 
               looking mildly indignant.

                                     DORSETT
                         To be quite honest it turns my 
                         stomach.

                                     RODGERS
                         Neither your stomach or your opinion 
                         matters here Dorsett... What matters 
                         is that Mr. Trafficante and the Bureau 
                         have come up with a solution to our 
                         Panther Problem. One might say...The 
                         Final Solution.

                                     TRAFFICANTE
                         Well put. As you and Agent Rodgers 
                         know, my organization has moved into 
                         narcotics. It was decided that this 
                         product would be confined to the 
                         ghettos. However, you and your police 
                         department has made operations in 
                         Oakland impossible. I take delivery 
                         of shipments and they sit. I -- and 
                         my associates -- lose money. Vast 
                         sums of money. Now, you have some 
                         very large problems with the Black 
                         community.

                                     RODGERS
                         More like a revolution. West Oakland's 
                         turning into hostile territory.

                                     TRAFFICANTE
                         I assure you the pacifying properties 
                         of Heroin are quite remarkable. See, 
                         junkie's politics are different from 
                         yours and mine. For them the only 
                         Party's the next fix.

                                     DORSETT
                         Dealing dope... And you want the

                         each others brains out over the stuff 
                         to be fucking with protests. Now 
                         I've got the product. What I need is 
                         a center of operation and someone to 
                         oversee the movement of the product. 
                         Not one of my people but a native, 
                         someone inside the community.

               Rodgers hits Dorsett with a piercing GLARE.

                         It has.

               INT. RITA'S APARTMENT - DAY

               JUDGE and LITTLE BOBBY sit, finishing dinner as Rita bustles 
               around clearing DISHES, being a mom...

               In the background, the TV plays, its sound turned down.

                                     RITA
                         Glad to see you boys eat like that. 
                         No wonder either you're both looking 
                         like scarecrows. Don't sleep, don't 
                         eat, ain't no way to live...

                                     LITTLE BOBBY
                         It's good to be skinny, easier to 
                         run from fat cops.
                              (his eye catching the 
                              TV)
                         Hey what's that?

               Casually, everyone glances at the television.

               HORROR hit RITA'S face.

                                     RITA

               INT. RITA'S BROWNSTONE - DAY

               Everyone stares at the television. Rita has dropped a BOWL 
               on the floor. Little Bobby's face is covered with TEARS.

                                     RITA
                         Oh lord, please god no. No.

                                     LITTLE BOBBY
                         They killed him. He never hurt nobody. 
                         They killed him...

               FOOTAGE: America EXPLODES into riot.

               EXT. MARKET STREET - DAY

               The Panthers trot over to where THREE YOUNG MEN face a SMALL 
               GROCERY. One's holding a GAS CAN.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         That's right burn the mother down.

               REVEREND SLOCUM steps from the shadows.

                                     SLOCUM
                         Hold on there, exactly what are you 
                         boys doing?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Sending a message... They shoot Dr. 
                         King... we burn them...

                                     SLOCUM
                         What good's burning our neighborhood 
                         down.

                                     YOUNG MAN #2
                         Fuck you.

               It gets TENSE. Then a voice come from a SIDE STREET.

                                     VOICE
                         Brother... you best clean out your 
                         head, or we will do it for you.

               Turning, the young man spots a CADRE of Panthers -- Tyrone, 
               Alma, and Little Bobby moving toward them.

                                     TYRONE
                         Reverend's right, you burn the 
                         neighborhood, you're just doing the 
                         pig's work for him. And we sure as 
                         hell ain't gonna stand for that. 
                         Dig?

               Eyeing the deadly serious Panthers, the men back down.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I dig. But how we gonna let 'em know 
                         we ain't gonna take this shit.

                                     ALMA
                         You know where Black Panther 
                         headquarters is? You come on down 
                         there, speak your mind, listen. 
                         Organize.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I don't know...

                                     TYRONE
                              (grabbing the can)
                         Later for that... be there.

               Rev. Slocum gazes at the Panthers with new respect as they 
               head off into the night.

               INT. PANTHER HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

               Tense, angry, the PANTHERS meets. Flanked by two PANTHER 
               BODYGUARDS, ELDRIDGE speaks pure rage.

                                     ELDRIDGE
                         No more words!!! No more god damn 
                         words!! No more sitting, no more 
                         praying for the pig to stop killing 
                         us. Later for lying down. Later for 
                         waiting to get shot like dogs. 
                         Nonviolence has died in Memphis, 
                         died with Dr. King. We must retaliate. 
                         We've got the fucking guns, it's 
                         time to use them.

                                     BODYGUARD
                         Off the pig man. Off the god damn 
                         pig.

               Bobby Seale -- his eyes steely -- INTERRUPTS.

                                     BOBBY
                         Brother Eldridge... I hear you. But 
                         I disagree. And we both know Huey 
                         disagrees too. Yeah, we got the guns, 
                         but the Pigs got more. The Pig has 
                         got the National Guard. I'm not afraid 
                         to fight. But we aren't stupid either. 
                         We got to be smart, not angry.

                                     ELDRIDGE
                         Later for that...

                                     TYRONE
                              (pissed)
                         No man... later for you! What? We 
                         gonna forget Huey and his trial? 
                         Start killing pigs, start the 
                         revolution now. With our leader in 
                         jail? We do that and Huey's a dead 
                         man. We're all dead. No man, we stay 
                         cool.

                                     ELDRIDGE
                         What? You giving me orders now?

                                     TYRONE
                         Just telling you what it is.

                                     ELDRIDGE
                         Fuck that. It's time to intensify 
                         the struggle. That is what it is.

               Indignant, Eldridge storms out -- his guards follow.

                                     BOBBY
                              (watching them leave)
                         Fuck.

               INT. VISITING ROOM - DAY

               Bobby Seale -- haggard, concerned -- faces HUEY under the 
               watchful eye of a GUARD.

                                     HUEY
                         You got to sit on Eldridge...

                                     BOBBY
                         Man, El-Rage is El-Rage. You know 
                         him.

                                     HUEY
                         Yeah, I do, but he's gotta cool it...

               EXT. STREET - OAKLAND - NIGHT

               TITLE: OAKLAND CALIFORNIA APRIL 6, 1968

               SMALL HOUSES sit quietly on this tree lined street, as...

               Car full of cops screeches into frame blasting ELDRIDGE fires 
               back. A couple of other Panthers scatter as Eldridge pulls 
               LITTLE BOBBY towards a house for safety.

                                     ELDRIDGE
                         C'mon.

               EXT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

               ELDRIDGE tumbles down STAIRS, LITTLE BOBBY right behind him. 
               They hunker down in the basement, sweating. Eldridge checks 
               his legs -- BLOOD soaks his pants.

               EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

               HALF A DOZEN police cars screech to a stop in front of the 
               house. Cops POP up, armed to the teeth.

               INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

               BULLETS tear through the room as Eldridge and Little Bobby 
               hit the deck. It's a ferocious volley of fire, hundreds of 
               shells pouring through the thin walls.

               EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

               For a second the GUNFIRE STOPS. A SERGEANT makes a motion to 
               his men. TEAR GAS rifles appear.

               The COPS fire gas canisters THROUGH the basement walls.

               INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

               Smoke chokes the room, as Little Bobby and Eldridge, blinded 
               hacking, crawl along the floor.

                                     LITTLE BOBBY
                         Papa E, we got to get out of here.

               Eldridge THINKS for a second.

                                     ELDRIDGE
                         Take off your clothes.

                                     LITTLE BOBBY
                         What?

                                     ELDRIDGE
                              (undressing)
                         Take 'em off. Pigs ain't gonna shoot 
                         an unarmed, naked man. Where they 
                         gonna say you hid a gun.

                                     LITTLE BOBBY
                         No man I can't.

                                     ELDRIDGE
                         Later for that. Just do it.

               EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

               HANDS UP, Eldridge and Little Bobby emerge from the house. 
               Eldridge's NAKED, Little Bobby's fully CLOTHED.

               Cops descend on them, grabbing them.

                                     COP#1
                              (pointing to a car)
                         Go on, get in that car fuckers, and 
                         don't try nothing.

               Moving very slowly, Eldridge heads for the car.

                                     ELDRIDGE
                         I am not resisting arrest!!

               Suddenly, a COP SHOVES Little Bobby forward. He stumbles a 
               bit, out in the open, EXPOSED.

               A VOLLEY of SHOTS rips through Little Bobby. Tearing him up, 
               KILLING him in moments.

               EXT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT

               Next to the car, Eldridge stares horrified at Little Bobby's 
               ruined body. A SERGEANT stands nearby.

               A COP approaches the Sergeant holding a .22 PISTOL.

                                     COP
                         He was going for this...

                                     ELDRIDGE
                              (disgusted)
                         Motherfuckers...

               Wham! The Sergeant PISTOL WHIPS Eldridge into unconsciousness

               The SCREEN goes BLACK.

               EXT. PANTHER HQ - DAY

               Opposite the HUEY poster, a new IMAGE hangs -- LITTLE BOBBY's 
               picture. A memorial to a Panther's martyr.

               EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

               A SMALL CASKET lowers into the ground. Panthers pay their 
               respects. The CROWD with JUDGE, ALMA, TYRONE, RITA, AND REV. 
               SLOCUM disperses.

                                     ALMA
                         Little Bobby... Just a kid...

                         up. Bobby Seale running all over the 
                         country holding things together. Cy 
                         dead. Little Bobby... I don't 
                         recognize half the faces at meetings.

               Tyrone's eyes JUDGE suspiciously.

                                     TYRONE
                         'Cept him...

               Strain showing on his face, BOBBY SEALE heads over.

                                     BOBBY
                         Look... I gotta get on a plane 
                         tonight. Huey's trial's starting. I 
                         need you to make sure there's a strong 
                         Panther Presence there.

                                     TYRONE
                         What about Cleaver? You got him out 
                         on bail, didn't you?

                                     BOBBY
                         Yeah... but well, things are too 
                         hot. Eldridge and Kathleen...

               EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

               Tyrone watches from the window of ELDRIDGE'S PLYMOUTH as 
               Eldridge and Kathleen climb out of the car and into the back 
               of an old pickup truck.

                                     BOBBY
                              (over)
                         ...they're gonna disappear...

               FOOTAGE: NEWSPAPER JULY 15, 1968

               The headline reads: NEWTON TRIAL BEGINS.

               INT. PANTHER HQ - DAY

               An absolute MADHOUSE of activity, Alma, Judge and Tyrone 
               juggle phones, fill boxes with pins. Everywhere the words: 
               FREE HUEY can be seen.

               END MONTAGE:

               INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

               Rodgers and Dorsett sit facing TWO BLACK MEN, one is named 
               SHORTY, the other we cannot see. Dorsett looks ill. He pops 
               a TUMS. BRIMMER'S there too, looking very unhappy.

                                     RODGERS
                         So you enjoy your little "vacation?"

                                     VOICE
                         I tell you, Vegas don't have much 
                         flavor. But it was alright. Good to 
                         get back to the neighborhood though.

                                     RODGERS
                         That's what we wanted to talk to you 
                         about. We have a proposition for 
                         you. One that will make you the most 
                         powerful man in West Oakland...

               The CAMERA MOVES. We see the man Rodgers is talking to -- 
               SABU.

                                     SABU
                              (smiling)
                         I'm all ears...

               EXT. SAN FRANCISCO BAY - DUSK

               SUNSET paints the water peaceful colors a night falls.

               INT. JUDGE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               It's late as Judge lays on his bed, staring at the ceiling, 
               tortured.

               BOOM! Judges door flies off its hinges. BRIMMER storms in -- 
               mean, drunk. He's on Judge in a second -- handcuffing him.

                                     JUDGE
                         Hey... what the hell you doing?

                                     BRIMMER
                         Shut up. Just shut the fuck up.

               EXT. BAY BRIDGE - NIGHT

               BRIMMER'S CAR pulls onto the bridge.

               INT. BRIMMER'S CAR - NIGHT

               Apprehensive, Judge eyes Brimmer from the back seat.

                                     JUDGE
                         Brimmer what's with you man?

               Stone silent, Brimmer takes a deep swig from a PINT BOTTLE.

               EXT. BAY BRIDGE - NIGHT

               Brimmer's car approaches the center of the Bridge, then KEEPS 
               GOING.

               INT. BRIMMER'S CAR - NIGHT

               Judge stares at Brimmer's back, relieved, confused.

                                     BRIMMER
                              (mumbling, loaded)
                         Twenty years asshole. Twenty years 
                         on the force. I've seen some fucked 
                         up stuff. Done some fucked up stuff...
                              (a beat)
                         But nothing like this...

               EXT. BAY BRIDGE - NIGHT

               Brimmer's car pulls over on the shoulder past the toll booth. 
               He yanks Judge out of the car. Then UNCUFFS him.

                                     BRIMMER
                         Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of 
                         here!!

                                     JUDGE
                         What? So you can shoot me? Call it 
                         resisting arrest?

                                     BRIMMER
                         I ain't gonna shoot you Judge. Look... 
                         it's over. Just run away. Get out. 
                         Stay away from Oakland. Cause it's 
                         gone... it's gone.

                                     JUDGE
                         Brimmer you're fucked up...

                                     BRIMMER
                         Yeah... I'm fucked up. You're fucked 
                         up. Government's fucked up. Whole 
                         country's fucked up. You got no idea 
                         what's going on here. This is bigger 
                         than you and me. We're just little 
                         tiny soldiers getting moved around 
                         on some big asshole's desk. The 
                         Panthers... fuck you're history... 
                         they killed you and you don't even 
                         know it.

                                     JUDGE
                         Who's they?

                                     BRIMMER
                              (rambling on getting 
                              into his car)
                         Drugs Judge, they're gonna flood 
                         West Oakland with dope. Jack you up 
                         and string you out like a two dollar 
                         whore. And while the community's 
                         shuffling for a fix, they're gonna 
                         snuff every Panther they can find.

                                     JUDGE
                         Who? I mean besides the FBI?

                                     BRIMMER
                         I don't know. Except, it's one of 
                         you. Maybe not a Panther, but it's 
                         someone from the neighborhood. Judge. 
                         Look, just go. Get away. It's over. 
                         You lost.
                              (a beat)
                         We all lost.

               Brimmer's car lumbers away, kicking up gravel. Judge -- 
               thinking furiously -- stares after it.

               THE BRIDGE looms up in the background, dwarfing Judge.

                                     JUDGE
                         Fuck that. Ain't nothing over.

               EXT. BAY BRIDGE - DAWN

               Judge WALKS across the bridge heading BACK to Oakland.

               EXT. JUDGE'S PLACE - DAY

               Judge, weary approaches his building. He spins, startled, as 
               something moves in the alleyway. A voice calls out.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Judge...

               Judge moves into the alley, eyes adjusting to the darkness.

                                     JUDGE
                         Rose?

                                     ROSE
                              (scared... whispering)
                         Yeah... Look man, what I gotta say. 
                         It's just you, me and the rats, right? 
                         Alright... well... Sabu's back.

                                     JUDGE
                         Motherfuck... well then I got 
                         something to do.

                                     ROSE
                         No... wait, there's something else, 
                         something weird. I hear he's set up 
                         down at that warehouse on fifty deuce. 
                         He's talking big and living bigger.

               REALIZATION dawns on Judge.

                                     JUDGE
                         God damn it's him. I gotta go.

                                     ROSE
                         Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's 
                         got juice now.

                                     JUDGE
                         You don't even know it man, but you're 
                         a god damn hero.

               Judge bolts out the alley. ROSE stares after him.

               INT. VISITING ROOM - JAIL - DAY

               MOS: Judge and HUEY TALK EARNESTLY through a GLASS PARTITION.

               EXT. STEPS - ALAMEDA COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

               Alma and Tyrone stand at the front of a huge CROWD standing 
               vigil for HUEY'S trial.

                                     CROWD

               INT. COURTROOM - DAY

               NEWSMEN cover every available seat, frantically writing notes 
               as THE PROSECUTOR finishes examining THE WOUNDED POLICE 
               OFFICER from the shoot-out.

               CHARLES GARRY, Huey's lawyer, a WHITE MAN in a rumpled suit, 
               sits next to Huey, with a STRANGE smile on his face...

                                     PROSECUTOR
                         Now you say that it was Huey Newton 
                         that opened fire without any 
                         provocation What makes you so sure? 
                         It was a dark night, there was a lot 
                         of confusion.

                                     WOUNDED COP
                         Well, sir I was there.

                                     PROSECUTOR
                         That's right you were.
                              (to the Jury)
                         He was there. He saw everything. And 
                         he is not on trial. He does not need 
                         to lie to save his life.
                              (to Garry)
                         Your witness.

                                     GARRY
                         Thank you.
                              (to the Judge)
                         If it would please the court, I would 
                         like to introduce testimony of a new 
                         witness. One who is not on trial for 
                         his life and... one who was there 
                         also. I call Gene McKinney to the 
                         stand.

               A MURMUR ripples through the court as Gene McKinney takes 
               the stand. The Prosecutor goes red with rage.

                                     PROSECUTOR
                         Objection, who is this man?

                                     GARRY
                         This is an eyewitness to the shooting. 
                         The passenger in Huey Newton's car.

                                     JUDGE
                         Overruled Mr. Garry you may examine 
                         your witness.

                                     GARRY
                         Mr. McKinney, were you a passenger 
                         in the car on the night of October 
                         28, 1967.

                                     GENE
                         Yes sir I was.

                                     GARRY
                         And did you witness the shoot-out?

                                     GENE
                         Yes sir, I did.

                                     GARRY
                         From what you saw, did Huey Newton 
                         start the shooting?

                                     GENE
                         No sir he didn't.

               More MURMURING, the Prosecutor looks dumbfounded.

                         Huh, well then...
                              (a pause)
                         did someone else start shooting?

                                     GENE
                         I refuse to answer the question on 
                         the grounds it might incriminate me.

               The COURTROOM EXPLODES in shock and amazement.

                                     GARRY
                         Did you shoot the officers in 
                         question?

                                     GENE
                         Again I'll take the fifth amendment 
                         on that question.

               MAYHEM, the Prosecutor begins yelling. The Judge bangs his 
               gavel, and the jury looks very confused.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Excited, ALMA slams down a PHONE. Every set of Panther eyes 
               is on her.

                                     ALMA

                         manslaughter.

                         It means youngblood, Huey's out in 
                         less than two years. He ain't gonna 
                         get the chair. He might not be free 
                         yet, but brothers and sisters he is 
                         not going to die.

               A CHEER ripples through the room. Alma HUGS Tyrone.

                         I gotta call Bobby...

               Tyrone reaches for the PHONE, it RINGS before he can pick it 
               up.

               POLICE CARS on a highway force a PANTHER wedding caravan off 
               the road. Guns drawn, cops rip SEALE from the car, dragging 
               him on his back toward an UNMARKED CAR.

               Click, the line goes dead. Tyrone smacks the phone into it's 
               cradle. GRIM-FACED, Tyrone looks to ALMA.

               INT. ROSE'S - NIGHT

               Something moves outside, Rose turns dropping his wine. It's 
               Sabu and Shorty. Sabu fires... killing Rose and his dog.

               INT. PANTHER HQ - NIGHT

               Judge moves into the dark, senses on alert. Something's wrong. 
               Suddenly he's attacked. He flips his assailant as the light 
               snap on. Tyrone has Judge in a choke hold, Alma has him at 
               gun point.

                                     JUDGE
                         Fuck is up?!

                         Mothafucker! You just set Bobby Seale 
                         up to be kidnapped. They dragged him 
                         off to some bullshit conspiracy trial 
                         in Chicago. How much the pigs pay 
                         you for this one, Judge?
                              (pulling out his gun 
                              and cocking it)

               Judge's HAND flies out, grabbing ahold of Tyrone's GUN HAND. 
               Neither moving a muscle, Judge STARES at Tyrone.

                                     JUDGE
                         You got it wrong.

               Alma, puts her 38 to Judge's face.

                                     ALMA
                         Let him go. And drop your piece.

               Outgunned, Judge obeys.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               An ANGRY COP lights a cigarette as his partner drives past 
               Panther HQ.

                                     ANGRY COP
                         Can't believe that rat bastard ain't 
                         going to the chair. That Newton turd 
                         should be taken out and shot.

               Pointing to the WICKER POSTER, the driver SMILES.

                                     PARTNER

               INT. PANTHER HQ - NIGHT

               Glaring at Judge, Tyrone's finger TIGHTENS on the TRIGGER.

                              (dead serious)
                         You better just kill me Tyrone. And 
                         when Huey gets out, when Oakland's 
                         just wall to wall junkies, you tell 
                         him you blew away the only chance we 
                         all got. I'm sure he'll be real happy 
                         about that.

                         The pigs are gonna start flooding us 
                         with dope. Huey wants us to stop 
                         them.

                         Tyrone hold on...

               BLAM!! A shot from outside shatters the window. The trio 
               dives for cover. Another SHOT wings ALMA.

               EXT. PANTHER HQ - NIGHT

               Out front, FOUR COPS in two cars, FIRE on the OFFICE. Bullets 
               rip into the POSTERS of HUEY and LITTLE BOBBY.

               INT. PANTHER HQ - NIGHT

               Tyrone, gun still on Judge, huddles on the floor.

               Screeching tires can be heard outside, the COPS LEAVING.

                                     TYRONE

                         Shut the fuck up!!

               Alma APPEARS her left arm BLOODY.

                                     ALMA

                         Let's go with Judge, check it out.

                                     TYRONE
                         What?!? Don't tell me you're buying 
                         this?

               A tense moment, Alma looks from Judge to Tyrone.

                                     ALMA
                         Yeah, I believe him. And you do too.

               After a moment of thought, Tyrone RISES. Then he picks up 
               JUDGE's .45. Alma GRABS her own GUN.

                                     TYRONE
                         Alright, but no fucking around.

               EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

               TWO BLACK THUGS stand on opposite sides of the warehouse 
               doors, checking out the street.

               INT. ELDRIDGE'S CAR - NIGHT

               TYRONE - in the passenger seat, a gun on Judge -- stares at 
               the warehouse from the car. Alma, her arm ROUGHLY BANDAGED 
               sits in back.

                                     ALMA
                         Those ain't cops.

                                     TYRONE
                         And they sure ain't from the 
                         neighborhood. Figure Sabu's in there?

                                     JUDGE
                         Yeah with a whole load of drugs. So, 
                         you trust me now?

               Tyrone takes his .38 off Judge, then COCKS Judge's .45 and 
               HANDS it to him

                                     TYRONE
                         Brother, I ain't got a choice...

               INT. WAREHOUSE OFFICE - NIGHT

               SABU is talking quietly with TRAFFICANTE's right hand man, 
               TONY. SHORTY and THREE BURLY BLACK BODYGUARDS stand nearby. 
               Suddenly Sabu hears and sound and pulls his gun.

                                     SHORTY
                         Fuck was that?

                                     SABU
                         Check the back.

               Suddenly gunfire rips out. Tony disappears as Shorty gets 
               taken down. One of the THUGS nails Tyrone in the shoulder, 
               Judge retaliates blasting him backwards.

                                     JUDGE
                              (helping Tyrone up)
                         You alright?

                                     TYRONE
                         Not really. Gimme the keys for the 
                         trunk.

               ALMA moves shakily from the BACK SEAT.

                                     TYRONE
                              (to Alma)
                         Stay here, watch this door. Anybody 
                         besides me and Judge steps out kill 
                         them.

               Alma -- ever the soldier -- NODS.

               INT. WAREHOUSE

               Warily, Judge and Tyrone step in. Tyrone's BLEEDING heavily. 
               Judge holds a GAS CAN. It's quiet. Too quiet.

                                     TYRONE
                         There it is...

               On a TABLE in the corner of the DARK warehouse sits BOXES, 
               VIALS and a stack of GLASSINE BAGS - filled with POWDER.

                                     JUDGE
                              (handing the CAN over)
                         Shut the motherfucker down. I'll 
                         find Sabu.

               Tyrone moves to the table. A BULLET hits him in the leg. 
               Another rips into Judge, dropping him to the floor.

                                     SABU
                              (over)
                         You just did.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

               Tyrone drops, his GAS CAN spilling out over the floor.

               Judge ROLLS -- operating like a soldier -- emptying the .45 
               into the BODYGUARD #1.

               Sabu and the other BODYGUARDS disappear into the SHADOWS.

               EJECTING the clip from the .45 and slams a fresh one in. He 
               gets to his feet, LIMPING into the DARKNESS.

               A NOISE sounds, Judge WHIRLS firing, dropping BODYGUARD #2. 
               Judge TURNS coming eye to eye with a .45, held by a very 
               HIGH SABU.

                                     SABU
                         Drop the gun Panther man.

               Pistol pushed against Judge's skull, Sabu moves around to 
               Judge's side. Judge DROPS the gun.

                                     SABU
                         All your mighty militant bullshit, 
                         man you don't know what fucking time 
                         it is do you? Dig it
                              (holding up a bag of 
                              COCAINE)
                         this is power baby.

                                     JUDGE
                         Sabu you sorry motherfucker...

                                     SABU
                         Sorry? Not me not now. This is my 
                         time not yours. Black Panthers? Who 
                         the fuck are you. Promising everything 
                         to everyone. Well fuck that. I got 
                         mine... Now y'all get yours... 
                         brother.

               Sabu COCKS the gun.

               Judge SPINS, batting Sabu's gun hand away.

                                     JUDGE
                         You ain't my fucking brother!!

               BULLETS tear through Sabu as TYRONE fires from the ground.

                                     TYRONE
                         Damn straight.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

               Judge and Tyrone help each other up... From BEHIND a CRATE, 
               the SECOND BODYGUARD bolts toward the DOOR.

               GUNFIRE blares out, blasting the BODYGUARD across the room. 
               ALMA appears in the doorway.

                                     TYRONE
                         Alma I told you to...

                                     ALMA
                              (icy calm)
                         Fuck that, we've got company...

               EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

               POLICE CARS pull up in front. Armed to the teeth with RIOT 
               GUNS, half a dozen COPS take up position behind the cars.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

               Alma -- hidden in the shadows -- watches the windows. Behind 
               her. Tyrone -- BADLY HURT -- leans against the wall next to 
               her. Behind them Judge finishes pouring out the GAS CAN.

                                     ALMA
                         Judge... hurry!

               Throwing that can away, Judge SMILES at Tyrone.

                                     JUDGE
                         Hey, brother you got a match?

               GUN SHOTS rip through the walls as the cops OPEN FIRE.

               EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

               Riot Guns pour lead into the building a la the Fred Hampton 
               massacre. Today, the police are taking no prisoners.

               Behind the POLICE, RODGERS watches the mayhem, SHAKING his 
               head. Whatever the outcome, the operation's OVER. Alone, he 
               WALKS back to his car.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

               Tyrone CRAWLS across the floor, leaving a trail of BLOOD, 
               toward Judge and Alma.

                                     JUDGE
                         Motherfuckers...

                                     TYRONE
                              (hurt bad)
                         Look... You... take her and get the 
                         hell out of here. I'll keep 'em busy.

                                     ALMA
                         No...

                                     TYRONE
                              (to Judge)
                         You gotta. You gotta stay alive. You 
                         know what they were trying to do 
                         here. You got the pigs dead to rights. 
                         It's like Huey said, you're more 
                         important than any of us.

                                     JUDGE
                         We'll all get out of here together.

                                     TYRONE
                         Later for that. I'm done either way...

               Another BARRAGE of bullets rips through the walls. One GRAZES 
               Tyrone's ARM. His GUN slides across the floor.

               The PISTOL settles ominously in front of Alma. She looks 
               over it at Tyrone. Their eyes LOCK.

                                     TYRONE
                         Go...

               Click! Clack! Faster than a thought, Alma checks, clears and 
               COCKS the pistol. She HANDS it to Tyrone. Tragic understanding 
               flows between them.

               Grabbing the pistol, Tyrone SCOOTS across the floor.

                                     ALMA
                         Tyrone!!!

               Near the door, Tyrone turns to Judge and raises his fist.

                                     TYRONE
                         Power to the people.

               EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

               FLAMES leaping up behind him, TYRONE, pure defiance, steps 
               out and FACES the cops.

               The IMAGE FREEZES. GUNFIRE cuts through the air. The moment 
               is frozen, in time, in history, in legend. Slowly, the IMAGE 
               dissolves. Fading into...

               EXT. PANTHER HEADQUARTERS

               SUPERIMPOSED over the WAREHOUSE FLAMES, the bullet-riddled 
               posters of HUEY and LITTLE BOBBY stare out, like a legacy... 
               or a warning.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CLOSE-UP: SIDEWALK - DAY

               CONCRETE, cracked and dirty, fills the frame. A SMALL FOOT 
               steps onto the pavement.

               EXT. 55TH AND MARKET - DAY

               A STOPLIGHT hangs at the once deadly intersection. SCHOOL 
               KIDS wait at the corner. The light CHANGES and they step 
               safely into the street.

                                     JUDGE
                              (over)
                         The community got the streetlight... 
                         finally. But the way I see it...

               THE SCREEN GOES BLACK. A TITLE APPEARS

               IN 1970 THERE WERE 300,000 ADDICTS IN THE U.S. YESTERDAY, 
               THERE WERE 3 MILLION...

                                     JUDGE
                              (over)
                         The struggle continues...

                                         THE END
