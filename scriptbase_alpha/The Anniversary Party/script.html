      <title>"THE ANNIVERSARY PARTY" -- by Alan Cumming &amp; Jennifer Jason Leigh</title>

<pre>


<b>	FADE IN:
</b>
<b>	TIGHT CLOSE - JOE THERRIAN - MORNING
</b>
	He's in his mid-thirties, his face relaxed in sleep,
	childlike.  Nestled soundly a tangle in the arms of his wife.

<b>	THE CAMERA STAYS CLOSE.  SLIGHTLY BLURRED, SOFT, SLOWLY
</b><b>	SWINGS ROUND
</b>
<b>	TIGHT CLOSE - SALLY THERRIAN
</b>
	She's in her mid-thirties, with large deep eyes.  She watches
	her husband unguarded in sleep.  Her pretty face, alert,
	she's barely breathing.  Traces the just visible lines around
	his eyes, and mouth.  Brushes fingertips against his
	eyelashes.

<b>	TIGHT CLOSE - SALLY'S HAND PULLS THE BEDROOM SHADE.
</b>
	It retracts with a loud WHACK, sun, sky, trees.

<b>			STEVEN (O.S.)
</b>		And breath...and chataronga...

<b>	EXT. POOL AREA - DAY
</b>
	We're in the middle of a yoga lesson.  Joe and Sally stand on
	their mats.  Steven, their instructor, wanders around the
	couple issuing soft-spoken instructions.

	A large room with hard wood floors, dominated by a huge
	fireplace.  The dining room on one side, living room on the
	other.  Floor to ceiling windows overlook the back porch
	garden pool... The house is classic Neutra.  All GLASS and
<b>	SMOOTH LINES.
</b>
	The calm is broken by the telephone.  Joe and Sally ignore it
	until the answering machine picks up.  They break their yoga
	poses and listen.

	The CAMERA hovers over the answering machine.

<b>			LUCY (O.S.)
</b>			(over answering machine; sweet,
			 British, slightly desperate)
		Joe, it's Lucy.  Remember me?  It's the
		black sheep here.  Bah...not funny.
		Haven't heard from you, need you, call
		me.  Love you madly.  Hi, Sally.  Joe,
		I'd love to talk to you before I go...

<b>			JOE
</b>		Go where?

<b>			LUCY (O.S.)
</b>			(over answering machine)
		It's a damn nuisance you aren't here, big
		brother.  Sorry I drone on.  I miss you.
		I lo--

	The machine cuts her off.

<b>	NEW ANGLE
</b>
	Joe and Sally have resumed their positions.  This wasn't the
	call they were waiting for.

<b>	WIDE SHOT
</b>
	AMERICA, forty-one, and ROSA, fifty, struggle up the steps of
	the back porch carrying grocery bags and packages, come
	through the sliding glass door...

<b>	THE CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM
</b>
	Through the dining room and into the kitchen, watches the two
	unpack groceries, flowers, etc., and start to dress the
	dining room table.  They speak quietly to each other in
	Spanish.

<b>			JOE
</b>		America, could you just...

	America closes the sliding doors between the kitchen and the
	dining room, giving the couple their privacy.

<b>			JOE (CONT'D)
</b>			(calls out)
		Thank you, America!

<b>			STEVEN
</b>		Okay, let's just take a deep breath, let
		your ribs expand and relax.  And reach up
		and into downward dog.

	Otis, the Bisenji/Sheperd mix, sleeping on his leopard
	pillow, stirs, stretches and groans.

<b>			JOE AND SALLY
</b>		Good boy, Otis.

	The phone RINGS again.

<b>			VOICE (O.S.)
</b>			(over answering machine)
		Hello, I have Dr. Harmon calling for
		Sally Therrian.

	Sally jumps out of the down dog position and runs to the
	phone, all angles.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Hello, hi, hi...and?  Thank God.

	Sally stands with the phone to her ear, her back to Joe.

<b>	EXT. POOL AREA - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	Joe watches her from his position, not concentrating on the
	teacher waiting a sign.  Sally returns to the lesson.  They
	do their handstands against the wall, on either side of the
	front door.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		No luck.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Oh, well, we'll just have to try again.
		Sound like a plan?

	Sally nods, she and Joe, at Steven's instructions, come out
	of their handstands and lie on the floor in a stretched
	relax, facing one another.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Happy anniversary, baby.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Happy anniversary.

	They smile.

<b>			STEVEN
</b>		And change sides...

	America slides open the dining room doors.  The dining table
	is covered with bundles of freshly cut flowers.  Rosa is
	singing in Spanish.

<b>			AMERICA
</b>			(with the authority of long
			 years of service)
		Mr. Joe, we have to have the house.  If
		you please now...

<b>			JOE
</b>		It's yours.

	The CAMERA glances off photos of the couple: portraits and
	candids, their wedding day, with friends, on vacation,
	tumbling on the lawn, and the like.
	Some framed and hung, some taped to the fridge or simply
	leaning on a shelf.  It's clear that at least a handful are
	by the same photographer, black and whites, grainy and
	beautiful.

	There are lots of photos of Joe and his sister Lucy,
	documenting their relationship from childhood.  There's an
	ANNIE LEIBOWITZ photo-shoot of Sally carelessly displayed
	somewhere.

<b>	INT. BEDROOM - LATER
</b>
	Joe stands behind Sally in front of the full length mirror,
	his arms around her, stroking her belly.

<b>			JOE
</b>		I love you.  Most beautiful woman in the
		world.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Hardly...

<b>			JOE
</b>		Accept a compliment.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		I think you're the most beautiful woman
		in the world.

	They move toward the bed.

<b>			JOE
</b>		What did you get me?

<b>			SALLY
</b>		In the morning, after everyone's gone and
		there's just us.

	She pushes him on the bed.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Kiss my eyes.

	She does.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		My wrists.

	He does.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Kiss the back of my knees.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Through the sweats or not?

<b>			JOE
</b>		Not.

	She pulls down his sweats.  She kisses the back of his knees.
	He turns, stares up at her.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		What?

<b>			JOE
</b>		You didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did
		you?

	Sally shakes her head.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		No.  Did you?

<b>			JOE
</b>			(after a beat)
		No.  I missed that.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		I missed all of you.  We're okay, aren't
		we?

<b>			JOE
</b>		We're great.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		I mean, you're really back.

<b>			JOE
</b>		For good.

	They begin to make love...the phone RINGS.

<b>			JOE (CONT'D)
</b>		Don't get it.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Well, it might be Clair.  They're
		threatening not to come...

<b>			JOE
</b>		What?

<b>			SALLY
</b>		They can't find a sitter...
			(into the receiver)
		Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.
			(she looks at Joe)
		Just a moment.
			(puts the call on hold)
		It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions
		to the house.  You invited Skye fucking
		Davidson to our anniversary party?

<b>			JOE
</b>		Okay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell
		you.  It was the only chance I had to
		meet her.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		You invited her to our anniversary party?
		I didn't even invite my mother.

<b>			JOE
</b>		She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally,
		I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on
		hold.

<b>			SALLY
</b>			(pissed)
		No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking
		Davidson, for fuck's sake.

<b>			JOE
</b>			(regards her)
		You want me to uninvite her?

<b>			SALLY
</b>		No, no of course not.  How old is she?
		Twenty-fucking-two?

	She gets out of bed, starts into the bathroom.  The CAMERA is
	with her.

<b>			SALLY (CONT'D)
</b>			(into the bathroom mirror)
		And she's a stinking fucking actress, for
		fuck's sake.

<b>			JOE
</b>			(into the receiver)
		Skye!
			(his face lights)
		I'm so glad you're able to make it...it's
		our sixth, actually.
			(flattered)
		You read the book again?  Well, no, the
		ending to chapter six...it's just that
		it's not filmic.
		We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it
		just wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can
		absolutely look at that again.  If you're
		coming from Laurel, you want to take
		Sunset west, we're just past Will Rogers
		State Park.  Three blocks west of that,
		you want to hang right.  It's about three
		quarters of a mile up a big white thing
		on the left.

	Sally's started the bath, and is watching him from the
	doorway.  He meets her eyes mid-sentence.

<b>			JOE (CONT'D)
</b>		Oh?  I don't think tonight.  I'm sure
		they're well behaved.  All our friends
		have dogs, and they always want to bring
		them.  We'd be outnumbered, you see?  So
		we sort of put a ban on it.  Sorry.

	He rolls his eyes.  Sally walks back into the bathroom, she
	isn't buying it.

<b>			JOE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>		I'm looking forward to meeting you, too.
		And Skye, I'm thrilled that you're
		willing to take this leap with me.
		Eternally grateful, really.

<b>			SALLY
</b>			(into the bathroom mirror)
		I'm going to throw up.

<b>			JOE (O.S.)
</b>		I can't imagine anyone else playing
		Genna.

<b>			SALLY
</b>			(sanguine)
		Really?

<b>	INT. BEDROOM - LATER
</b>
	The doorbell rings.  There are two closed doors on either
	side of the room.  The bed shows no sign of consummated sex.
	Joe comes through the left hand door, nearly dressed.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Who the fuck can be here at this time?
		It's not even seven!

	Sally comes through the other door, one shoe off, one on.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Oh Jesus, who else is always early for
		Christ's sake?

<b>	NEW ANGLE
</b>
	Sally kisses his cheek on her way to the door.

<b>			SALLY (CONT'D)
</b>		Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.

<b>			JOE
</b>		I'll say as little as possible.

	Sally exits the bedroom.

<b>	HOLD ON JOE
</b>
	For a moment, then Sally re-enters, kisses him deeply.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		I love you.

<b>	INT. FOYER - EARLY EVENING
</b>
	The house is filled with exquisite flower arrangements,
	candles everywhere.

	JERRY and JUDY ADAMS are on the porch, just beyond the glass
	of the front door.  Their argument is inaudible.  They're in
	their mid-thirties, conservatively dressed.  She's stunning,
	genetically nervous.  Jerry carries a briefcase.  She's got
	the gift.

	Sally opens the door.  Hugs and buses them, hello.

<b>			JUDY
</b>		I know we're early, we're so early.
		Sorry.

<b>			JERRY
</b>		You have to sign your taxes anyway.

<b>			SALLY
</b>			(a grin)
		Of course we do.
			(to Judy)
		We have to sign our taxes.

<b>			JOE
</b>			(kisses Judy; all charm)
		You can never be too early or too thin.

<b>			JERRY
</b>		Happy anniversary, buddy!  Six months
		ago, who would have thunk it?

	Jerry hugs Joe.

<b>			JOE
</b>			(sotto)
		Well, not me, to be honest.

<b>			JERRY
</b>			(sotto)
		Don't fuck up again.  It's got a ripple
		effect.  Sally suffers, we all suffer.

<b>			JUDY
</b>			(offers)
		We have a gift?

<b>			JOE
</b>		Thanks, I'll take that.  Champagne?

<b>			JUDY
</b>		Lovely.

	Joe moves toward the kitchen.

<b>			JERRY
</b>			(a moment, to Sally)
		We closed.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Fantastic.
			(takes his hand)
		Out here.

	They step out onto the porch.  Judy's left alone, unsure
	whether to follow or not.

<b>			JUDY
</b>			(finally, to no one, and to no
			 response)
		The house looks beautiful, are those
		hydrangeas?

	She stands awkwardly in the middle of the foyer.

<b>	EXT. PORCH - CONTINUOUS
</b>
<b>			JERRY
</b>		Joe officially owns No. 4, Cheyenne Walk,
		Chelsea, London, England.  No small
		doing.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		I love you, you're a genius.

	Behind them, in the foyer, Judy wanders aimlessly.

<b>			JERRY
</b>		I suppose.  Sally, that's quite a gift.
		I'm not sure it's in your best interest.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		I adore him.

<b>			JERRY
</b>		The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the
		morning.  The house had to go on the
		market to insure the loan on the London
		flat.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		I know.  I know that.  Don't spoil it.

<b>			JERRY
</b>		What you earn has to double in order to
		cover expenses in London, it's an
		outrageously expensive city.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		We've only been over this how many times?

<b>			JERRY
</b>		You only made half your quote this year.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Well, you're a tower of support.

<b>			JERRY
</b>		I worry because you don't.  It's my job.
		I'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it
		if you waited until the two of you were
		on more solid ground.

<b>			SALLY
</b>			(direct, simple)
		We couldn't be on more solid ground.

<b>			JERRY
</b>		Whatever you say.  Listen, I love you.

	Otis is barking.

<b>			JOE (O.S.)
</b>		Otis!  No barking!

<b>			SALLY
</b>			(touched)
		And Joe's huge in Europe.  He's like a
		rock star in London.  His novels sell
		millions.

<b>			JERRY
</b>		Not millions.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		He's directing now.

<b>			JERRY
</b>		They're paying him scale.

	The CAMERA catches sight of Joe behind them.  He moves
	through the foyer and into the living room with a tray of
	glasses and Judy in tow.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		He gets huge advances on his novels.
		He's going back to that.  You know how he
		hates it here.

<b>			JERRY
</b>		There's still time to undo this.

<b>			SALLY
</b>			(kisses his cheek)
		We'll be fine.

<b>			JERRY
</b>			(re: barking dog)
		Did you invite them?

<b>			SALLY
</b>		The Roses?  And of course they said yes.

<b>			JERRY
</b>		That was the plan.  And you're thrilled
		to have them.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Whatever you say.

<b>			JERRY
</b>		Did you tell Joe to behave?

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Yes.

<b>			JERRY
</b>		Did he promise?

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Scout's honor.

<b>			JERRY
</b>		Before I forget.
			(pulls a novel from his
			 briefcase)
		Put it on the bookshelf.

	She flips the book -- on the back is a full page picture of
<b>	RYAN ROSE.
</b>
<b>			SALLY
</b>		You're out of your mind.

<b>			JERRY
</b>		Just do what I say, alright?

<b>			SALLY
</b>		How much bowing and scraping do you want
		us to do?

<b>			JERRY
</b>		Beats a lawsuit.

<b>	INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	Joe and Judy sit on opposite sides of the sofa -- slightly
	uncomfortable with each other.

<b>			JOE
</b>			(to fill the silence,
			 conspiratorial grin)
		I love gifts.  What did you guys get us?

<b>			JUDY
</b>			(chokes on the champagne)
		Nothing that can't be exchanged.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Oh.  Well.  Good.

<b>			JUDY
</b>		Congratulations on the deal.  How
		exciting.  Is Sally doing Sally?  I mean
		it's Sally.  The character that's based
		on Sally.  The character that's based on
		Sally in the book.

<b>			JOE
</b>		The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing
		the lead.

<b>			JUDY
</b>		Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan.
		She's very beautiful.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Yes, she is.

<b>			JUDY
</b>			(trying harder)
		But I am right, yes?  She's based on
		Sally.

<b>			JOE
</b>		It's a novel.

<b>			JUDY
</b>		Still.  Well.  Let's drop it.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Yes.

<b>			JUDY
</b>		I'm not much of a reader, but I do love
		autobiographies, even biographies
		sometimes.  Mostly non-fiction.  Did you
		read the new Styron?

<b>			JOE
</b>		No.

<b>			JUDY
</b>		It's very good.
			(a moment)
		I understand you won the Booker Prize.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Yes I did.

<b>			JUDY
</b>			(another moment)
		Is your script much like the novel?
		Jerry says it's very good.  But you know,
		you read the novel, and then you see the
		movie - and most of the time you say,
		"what's this?" You know?  I sometimes
		think we're better off not reading the
		novel at all.  Because, we come with
		expectations... and of course, we know
		where we're going.  Don't you find?

<b>			JOE
</b>		Don't I find what?

<b>			JUDY
</b>		I don't know why Joe, we've known each
		other how long...

<b>			JOE
</b>		Not long.

<b>			JUDY
</b>			(benign)
		Don't be silly.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Joking.

<b>			JUDY
</b>		Yes I know.  I started to say... I
		started to say Joe that --

<b>			JOE
</b>		Do I put you off?

<b>			JUDY
</b>		You manage to throw me off balance.  I
		adore you.

<b>			JOE
</b>		And I you.

<b>			JUDY
</b>		But I'm always afraid I'll say something
		stupid.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Ah.

<b>			JUDY
</b>		And so I always manage to, do you see?
		Like the book/script thing, do you see?

<b>			JOE
</b>		Mmm hmmm.

<b>	INT. FOYER
</b>
	CAL and SOPHIA GOLD are there with their children - JACK and
	EVIE - eight and six respectively.  Carrying gifts and totes
	with toys and changes.  Jerry and Sally have gathered them up
	and ushered them in.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		You know Jerry.

<b>			CAL
</b>		Yes, of course.

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		I'm the wife.  We've met.

<b>			JERRY
</b>			(hugs her)
		You, I know.

<b>			SALLY
</b>			(to Evie)
		Hey, beautiful girl.

	She picks up the four-year-old, swings her around.  Jack
	hides behind his father's legs.

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>			(a grin)
		Jack?  Jack, you promised.

	The little boy comes out from behind his father's legs,
	covers his eyes with his hands.

<b>			JACK
</b>			(sings)
		Happy anniversary to you.  We're glad Joe
		came home.  Don't split up again.  Cause
		we like the food.

	Much laughter and clapping.

<b>			JOE
</b>			(in the archway)
		Jack.  Did you compose that yourself?

<b>			CAL
</b>		Absolutely.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Had a little help?

<b>			CAL
</b>		Absolutely not.

<b>			JOE
</b>		It has your ring.

<b>			CAL
</b>		I'm not that good.

<b>			JERRY
</b>		Cal, my wife Judy.

<b>			JUDY
</b>		Nice to meet you.

<b>			CAL
</b>		I think we've met, actually.  No?  At
		another one of these things?

<b>			JUDY
</b>		No, I don't think so.

<b>			JERRY
</b>			(to Cal)
		Congratulations on the Academy Award.
		Great performance.  Really warranted.

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		He thought so.

<b>			JERRY
</b>		Sally always manages to get robbed.

<b>			SALLY
</b>			(a mortified grin)
		Enough about me.

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		Evie has a little something for you.

	Evie shakes her head.

<b>			SOPHIA (CONT'D)
</b>		You do.

<b>			EVIE
</b>			(even)
		I don't think so.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Since when are you so shy?

<b>			EVIE
</b>			(her mother's daughter)
		Never.

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>			(bright smile)
		Honey, we have gifts for you and all
		sorts of surprises.  Where is America?  I
		know she's here somewhere.

	Joe reaches for the gifts.

<b>			JOE
</b>		I'll take them.

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		No, I have a little talking to do with
		America.  Privately.  I'll find her.

<b>			SALLY
</b>			(to Sophia)
		In the kitchen.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Who'd like to go and find Otis?

<b>			EVIE
</b>		Me!

<b>			JACK
</b>		I guess.

<b>			JUDY
</b>		The infamous dog?

<b>			JOE
</b>		He's the best dog in the world.
			(to Judy)
		They're both coming tonight.  Not my
		idea.

<b>			JUDY
</b>		Ours.

<b>			JOE
</b>		It's Jerry's worst idea.

<b>			CAL
</b>		What's that?

<b>			JOE
</b>		The neighbors from hell.  The kind that
		lay in wait.  I'd rather move actually.
		Wouldn't I?
			(to Sally)
		Wouldn't I?

<b>			SALLY
</b>			(small smile)
		Yes.

<b>			JOE
</b>			(to the kids)
		Okay.  Last one to find Otis is a smelly
		old bum.

	Joe goes off with the children to find Otis.  Cal sits at the
	piano, plays.

<b> 				INT. FOYER - FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	Joe holds Evie in one arm.  Jack stands beside him, holds his
	hand.  MONICA and RYAN ROSE face him across the threshold --
	the NEXT DOOR NEIGHBORS.  She's in her late twenties - and
	beautiful, eyes everywhere - star struck and house struck.
	Ryan is somewhat older, a little awkward in company,
	swallowing resentment and a little self righteous.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Well, hello you two.
			(putting Evie down; to Jack)
		These are the people who live next door.
		Say hello.

	Jack does.

<b>			JOE (CONT'D)
</b>		And close the door, Jack.  Because if we
		leave it open, Otis will run out and you
		know what will happen then?

<b>			JACK
</b>		Uh, uh.

<b>			JOE
</b>		He'll run next door into their backyard
		and he'll bark and bark and bark and eat
		their pitbull for his dinner.  Is it a
		pitbull?

<b>			RYAN
</b>			(not amused)
		No, actually.

<b>			JOE
</b>			(to Jack)
		Oh whatever.  We don't want that to
		happen, do we?

<b>			JACK
</b>		No?

<b>			RYAN
</b>		It's a rottweiler, actually.
			(to Jack)
		I don't think our rottweiler is in any
		danger, Jack.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Well, Jack and I are very relieved.

<b>			RYAN
</b>		I thought this was a party.  Are we going
		to talk about the dog thing?

<b>			MONICA
</b>		Please, Ryan.

<b>			JOE
</b>			(kisses her cheek and shakes
			 his hand)
		No, he's absolutely right.  You're
		absolutely right, Ryan.  Dog talk must be
		banned.  Canine conversations are
		completely discouraged... it's really
		good of you to join us.  Can I get you a
		drink?

<b>			RYAN
</b>		Not for me, thanks.

	An awkward moment.

<b>			MONICA
</b>			(checks with Ryan)
		Something soft.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Right away.  Are you sure you wouldn't
		like something soft, Ryan?

<b>			RYAN
</b>		I'm sure, yes.

	Sally has watched some of this from the archway, joins them
	super-friendly.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Hi.  Monica and Ryan?

<b>			MONICA
</b>		Sally?

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Yes.  And you've met Joe.

<b>			RYAN
</b>		Yes.

<b>			SALLY
</b>			(a deep breath)
		Well, so glad you decided to come.

<b>			MONICA
</b>		We could hardly say no.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Oh?

	Joe slips the coke into Monica's hand.

<b>			SALLY (CONT'D)
</b>			(takes the gift)
		Thank you.  This was so unnecessary.  I
		hope you've noticed that Otis isn't
		barking as much.  We keep him in at
		night.

<b>			RYAN
</b>		At 4:30 today he barked for a solid
		fifteen minutes.  I have it on tape.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		You're keeping a record, are you?

<b>			RYAN
</b>		It's just very distracting when you're
		trying to work.

<b>			MONICA
</b>		Ryan.

<b>			RYAN
</b>			(to Joe)
		I'm sure you understand.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Well the neighborhood is full of dogs,
		and it's not always Otis.

<b>			RYAN
</b>		Well today it was Otis.  And you should
		keep him away from our yard.  Because
		Sheila will defend herself.

<b>			MONICA
</b>		Ryan!

<b>			SALLY
</b>			(cuts off response from Joe; to
			 Ryan)
		Are you working on a new book?

<b>			RYAN
</b>			(caught short; flattered)
		Well, yes, actually.

<b>			MONICA
</b>		He always has two or three going...

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Really?  Joe can't manage more than one
		at a time.  With huge gaps in between.

<b>	NEW ANGLE
</b>
	MAC and CLAIR FORSYTHE wave from the door.  Clair's arms are
	full of presents.  Mac carries three video cameras under his
	arm.  He's got Otis by the collar.

<b>			MAC
</b>		You lose this?

<b>			JOE
</b>			(re: Otis)
		Ah there's our snookums now.

<b>			RYAN
</b>		Yes, well, but I haven't won a Booker
		either.  Or the Whitebread.

<b>			MAC
</b>		The gate was open.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Well, not yet.
			(she reacts to Mac)
		The gate was open?

<b>			JOE
</b>		It's taken care of.

<b>			MONICA
</b>		I think Ryan needs a new publisher.  I
		think he's outgrown him.  They're just
		not doing their job.

	A silence.  Awkward smiles go all around.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Hors d'oeuvres or something?

<b>			MONICA
</b>		Yes, great!  It's a beautiful house.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Thank you.  I understand you're an
		interior decorator.

<b>			MONICA
</b>		Yes.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		I so wish I'd known.

<b>			MONICA
</b>		Well, whoever did this is amazing.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		I did it.

<b>			JOE
</b>			(comes on them with the
			 Forsythes in tow)
		She rarely cops to it.
			(kisses Sally's cheek)
		Otis is home.

<b>			CLAIR
</b>			(re: the gifts)
		Where can I put these?

	Sally takes the gifts from her.

<b>			CLAIR (CONT'D)
</b>		What a fucking day!  We only just got a
		sitter.  I don't know her from fucking
		Adam.  She could be a serial killer.  I'm
		going to have to call every ten minutes.
		You have to let me give out the number.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Of course.

<b>			MAC
</b>		She already has.

<b>			CLAIR
</b>		It's alright, isn't it?

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Of course it's alright.

<b>			MAC
</b>		Clair is a hovering mother.

<b>			CLAIR
</b>		I'm not.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		This is Monica and Ryan.  Mac and Clair.

	Clair takes a glass of champagne off the tray as they make
	their way down the hall.

<b>			CLAIR
</b>			(a wide professionally
			 ingratiating smile)
		So nice...

<b>			MONICA
</b>		And for us... Truly.

<b>			CLAIR
</b>		Well...

<b>			MONICA
</b>		You will never know.

<b>			CLAIR
</b>			(pleased)
		Oh.
			(to Sally)
		I have a four-thirty call.  AM.  So we
		may have to leave early.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Why didn't you bring him?

<b>			CLAIR
</b>		What?

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Why didn't you bring him?

<b>			CLAIR
</b>			(searches)
		He's allergic.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Oh.

<b>			CLAIR
</b>		To dander.  Otis.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Oh.

<b>			CLAIR
</b>		Didn't I say?

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Well, probably.

<b>			CLAIR
</b>		They can tell from the eyelashes, you
		know?  He's got eyelashes yay long.  They
		must be a foot long.  The older you are
		when you have a baby, the more likely
		this stuff is to crop up.

<b>			SALLY
</b>			(muted)
		Oh.

	The Roses are happy to stand there on the fringe.  Next to
	someone they've only seen on screen and magazine covers.

	Clair's not in the least put off by them.  She manages to
	smile at them inclusively from time to time.

<b>			CLAIR
</b>		So they tell me.  Not soon enough, of
		course.
			(kisses her cheek)
		How are you, Sal?  You look fantastic.
		It changes your life, you know.  A baby.
		It puts everything in perspective,
		doesn't it.  Doesn't it, Mac?  You can't
		be the center of your own world, anymore.

<b>			MAC
</b>			(as grounded as Clair isn't)
		It's an object lesson in grace.
			(on seeing Cal Gold on the back
			 porch)
		Wow!  Look who's here before me!  My
		leading man is on time for once.

<b>			CAL
</b>			(at the piano)
		Those who can't direct.

<b>			MAC
</b>		Fuck you.

<b>	EXT. POOL AREA
</b>
	Mac and Cal sit on the porch sharing a joint.  Cal is maybe
	the only living complete works of Shakespeare and pulls out
	his most arcane quotes on occasion.

<b>			CAL
</b>		Are those our dailies?  You're totally
		outrageous.  It's their anniversary.  Is
		nothing sacred!  Well...so...how am I?

<b>			MAC
</b>			(laughing)
		Oh man, you are so fucking funny in the
		kitchen scene.

<b>			CAL
</b>		I liked the third take, the accidental
		disaster with the silverware.

<b>			MAC
</b>		Nothing you do is accidental...

<b>	MEDIUM FULL SHOT
</b>
	The CAMERA spots GINA TAYLOR through moving bodies.  Tall,
	beautiful, centered grace.  She's got a Leica around her
	neck... drops her two large camera bags on the floor.

	Several of the other guests greet her, Mac among them.

<b>	TIGHT CLOSE
</b>
	Joe sweeps her up to his arms.  It's an intimate,
	appreciative embrace.  Theirs was a mid-30s relationship,
	certainly pre-Sally.  Maybe his first important love.

<b>			GINA
</b>			(re: the cameras)
		I'm the hired help.

<b>			JOE
</b>			(affectionate)
		Fuck you.

<b>			GINA
</b>		I never put myself in harm's way.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Anymore.

<b>			GINA
</b>		No, not anymore.  Happy anniversary,
		scout.

<b>	NEW ANGLE
</b>
	Sophia bursts from the kitchen.

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		Oh my God!  America told me your
		neighbors are coming?

<b>			SALLY
</b>		And here they are!

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		And she was saying how happy you were to
		finally have them over.  Because you're
		both, so, what - introspective?  And you
		should have done it ages ago.  I'm Sophia
		Gold.
			(rescuing Sally)
		Come meet my husband, Cal.

<b>			MONICA
</b>		Cal Gold?

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		The very one.  And you are...

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Monica and Ryan.

<b>			RYAN
</b>		Rose.

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		Sorry?

<b>			RYAN
</b>		Ryan Rose.

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		Yes.

	She shakes his hand.  He's amazed at the solid grip.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		He's a novelist.

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		Ah.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Like Joe.

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		Hmm.
			(to Sally)
		Where are my kids?

<b>			SALLY
</b>		In the guest room.  I've laid out a paint
		table for them.

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		I hope they're watercolors!

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Nevermind.

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>			(to Monica)
		Would you like to meet my husband?

	It's all Monica can do to keep from putting her hand to her
	chest.

<b>			MONICA
</b>		I'd be thrilled.

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		Then he'll be thrilled.

	She ushers them toward the living room.

<b>			JOE
</b>			(re: Sophia, appreciative)
		She's such pure evil.

	Sally approaches, gives Gina a warm kiss on the chest.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Thanks for coming.

<b>			GINA
</b>		Happy anniversary.  You're a good match,
		you two.
			(to Joe)
		Can you help me with this stuff?

<b>			JOE
</b>			(re: one of her bags)
		That for us?

<b>			GINA
</b>		What a nose.  You missed your calling.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Can I open it?

<b>			GINA
</b>			(defers)
		Sally?

<b>			JOE
</b>		Please?

<b>			SALLY
</b>		He's impossible.  Go on then.

	Joe rips open the gift.  It's a framed black and white of
	Joe, Sally and Otis lying on the couch.  It's clear which
	photos in the house are Gina's.  It's a breathtaking print,
	an amazing caught moment.  All light and shadow.  A touching
	study.

<b>			SALLY (CONT'D)
</b>			(respectful of the talent)
		It's beautiful, thank you so much.

	Joe, moved somehow, hugs Gina to him.  Kisses her.

<b>			JOE
</b>		I love you,  Gina Taylor.

	Sally's uncomfortable, a little jealous... feels intrusive.
	Aware that Gina got there first.  Knew him when.  And always
	captures something naked and vulnerable in his face.

<b>						   CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT. GUEST ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	In the center of the room a low table with paints and crayons
	and glue and baubles.  Two child size chairs either side.
	Empty, the table hasn't been touched.

	Evie stands against the far wall.  She wears a helmet and is
	surrounded by toy suction arrows.  The arrows make a perfect
	outline of her head and body.  Jack stands three feet away,
	bow in hand -- the archer prepares his next shot.

<b>	INT. LIVING ROOM
</b>
	Cal is at the piano, charming the neighbors.  Judy chats with
	Mac.  Jerry is on his cellphone, holding his Palm Pilot, his
	hand pressed against his ear to block out the chatter.  Sally
	joins Cal on the piano stool.  Sophia moves to Clair on the
	couch, kisses her cheek.

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		You look so well, Clair.  A wraith.

<b>			CLAIR
</b>			(pleased)
		You think so!?  I've been working out a
		lot since the baby.
		And I've been working.  And that takes
		it's toll, you know.

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		I'm glad that's all over for me.

<b>			CLAIR
</b>		Don't you miss it?

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		Never.

<b>			CLAIR
</b>		Really.

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		Not for a second.  Cal can have all that.

<b>			CLAIR
</b>		Really?

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		So where is young Jonah?

<b>			CLAIR
</b>		With a sitter.  We have a sensational
		sitter.  Jonah's really comfortable with
		her.  You know, a second mom sort of.
		Like part of the family.  Amazing with
		kids.

	She inadvertently touches the beeper on her belt, and it
	beeps.  She jumps.

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		What is that thing?

<b>			CLAIR
</b>		So this sitter can always reach me.  I'm
		still not used to leaving him.

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		You should have brought him.

<b>			CLAIR
</b>			(shrugs)
		Dander.  He's allergic.  Otis.

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		Oh.  Do you have any pictures?

<b>			CLAIR
</b>		Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I
		left my tote in the damn trailer.  But!
		He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac
		shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact
		is they probably didn't even need me for
		this birth.

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		Are you the funniest person I know, or
		what?

<b>			CLAIR
</b>		I can't think how you gave it all up,
		Soph.

	Sophia sends her a soft, content smile.  Otis comes over and
	nuzzles Clair's knee.

<b>			CLAIR (CONT'D)
</b>			(freeks)
		Oh my God, the dog!

<b>	INT. KITCHEN/HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	Clair leads Sally towards the bedroom.

<b>			CLAIR
</b>		It sounds hysterical, but Otis just
		rubbed up against me and I'd kind of like
		to change into something of yours.  You
		know it could be disaster.  He's so
		allergic.  It's terrifying.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Borrow whatever you like.

<b>			CLAIR
</b>		I'll change back before we leave.

<b>			SALLY
</b>			(pointed)
		Whatever you like.  I'm afraid it'll all
		be too big for you.
			(a moment)
		Are you alright, Clair?

<b>			CLAIR
</b>		I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Well, I'm a little
		stressed.  And I've been taking pills to
		get my weight down since the baby.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		I'd say it was down.

<b>			CLAIR
</b>		And the doctor said they might make me a
		little jumpy.  I've got a ghastly
		headache, actually.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		You want a Tylenol, or something?

<b>			CLAIR
</b>		I'd love a Xanex.
			(a moment)
		Sally, please don't tell Sophia that I'm
		not breast feeding.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Why would she care?

<b>			CLAIR
</b>		You know Sophia.  She's so damned
		judgemental.  And she's so damned...
		perfect.  And so fucking... serene.  Just
		fucking don't tell her.  Because you know
		Mac thinks she's God.  And I can feel him
		comparing.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		You need to knock off the pills, Clair.

<b>			CLAIR
</b>		Just don't fucking tell her.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		It's not going to come up.

<b>	INT. FOYER - LEVI PANES THROUGH THE GLASS DOOR - DAY
</b>
	A Peter Sellers look-a-like holding a violin case.

<b>			JOE
</b>			(opens the door)
		Panes!  How are you?

<b>			PANES
</b>		Oh, you know, I am.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Has she called?

<b>			PANES
</b>		She'll never call again.  She called last
		week to tell me she'll never call again.
		Where's Sally?

<b>			SALLY (O.S.)
</b>		Here I am.  Panes, my love!

	Sally starts down the hallway.

<b>			SALLY (CONT'D)
</b>			(for Panes; a long supportive
			 hug; a kiss)
		Good, you brought your violin.  I want
		you to play.

<b>			PANES
</b>		It's a machine gun.  I thought I'd kill
		myself.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Are you lovesick?

<b>			PANES
</b>		Suicidal.  It's much less codependent.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Will champagne help?

<b>			PANES
</b>		Not enough.

	Sally takes Panes into the living room where everyone chats,
	drinks, smokes.  They all like each other out of habit, if
	nothing else.  Ryan and Monica are on the fringe, stand at
	the edges of conversation.  There's always someone at the
	piano, and they can all pretty much play.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Panes is here!

<b>			PANES
</b>			(gives everyone a shy, pained
			 little wave)
		Oh great.

	Everyone stops, turns, toasts.

<b>			EVERYONE
</b>		Panes!

<b>			MONICA/RYAN
</b>			(a little late; into silence)
		Panes.

	Panes gives them another little wave.  Doorbell rings.

<b>	TIGHT CLOSE - SKYE DAVIDSON
</b>
<b>			SKYE
</b>		Hi.

	She's the young, beautiful actress who'll play the lead in
	Joe's film.

<b>			JOE

		Skye!

	She's in jeans, but somehow looks dressed to the 9s.

<b>			SKYE
</b>		You're Joe, aren't you?
			(nods knowingly)
		I recognized you from the book jacket.

	Joe grins from ear to ear.  Uncharacteristically star struck
	in front of this beauty.

<b>			JOE
</b>		How do you do, Skye?

<b>			SKYE
</b>		Oh, I love that.
			(throws arms around him)
		I'm just great.  I'm so happy to be here.
		And I apologize for invading you.  And
		I'm so happy you asked me to.  I'm so
		touched.  I know how private you and
		Sally are.

<b>			JOE
</b>			(uncomfortable)
		Yeah, well, it's just us and a few
		hundred of our closest friends.

<b>			SKYE
</b>			(genuine)
		When I read your work I felt that you
		knew me.  Women must tell you that.  And
		this one in particular speaks to me, do
		you know?  I am Genna.  How many women
		must tell you that.  And the script is
		wonderful.  Wonderful and lean and
		visual...

<b>			JOE
</b>		I'm so happy you like it.  I'm so
		relieved you said yes, and I'm really,
		um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to
		finally meet you.

<b>			SKYE
</b>		You're going to be a remarkable director,
		a brilliant director.

	There's a long moment.

<b>			JOE
</b>			(finally)
		I think you're my first Goddess.

	Sally and Panes have been watching from the living room.

<b>			PANES
</b>		She's even better looking in the flesh.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Really?  I need a drink.  Come hide with
		me.

<b>	INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
	America and Rosa are working at the counter, Panes and Sally
	come through.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Oh, Jesus, Panes.  I can't, I can't
		believe that bitch is in my house.

<b>			PANES
</b>		You don't know she's a bitch.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		She's all over him, are you blind?

<b>			PANES
</b>		It could be worse.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		How?

<b>			PANES
</b>		She could be playing the role in Joe's
		movie that should be yours.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Fuck you, Panes.

<b>			PANES
</b>		You see, that's worse.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		I just wanted tonight to be with the
		people we love.

<b>			PANES
</b>		Like your business managers?

<b>			SALLY
</b>		They're not just our business managers,
		Panes.

<b>			PANES
</b>		Oh, okay, forgive me.  Your neighbors are
		here, for fuck's sake.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Exactly what I mean.  It's all ruined.

<b>			PANES
</b>		It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's
		one of your parties.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		I don't want it to be just one of our
		parties.

<b>			PANES
</b>		"How are you really doing, Panes?"
		"Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Like the last time.

<b>			PANES
</b>		No.  No, not like the last time.  She was
		the rest of my life.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Like the last time.

<b>			PANES
</b>		I wasn't finished.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Okay.

<b>			PANES
</b>		"We can't stand seeing you like this,
		Panes.  I hate you being alone.  Why
		don't you stay with us for a while?"
		"I'd love to, thanks."

<b>			SALLY
</b>		It's our anniversary, Panes.

<b>			PANES
</b>		I didn't hear me say tonight.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		We're just feeling our way back.

<b>			PANES
</b>		"Otherwise, we'd insist on your being
		here."

<b>			SALLY
</b>		You know it's true.

	Skye bursts into the kitchen, Sally and Panes freeze.

<b>			SKYE
</b>			(stuck)
		Oh my God, sorry.  I'm interrupting.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		I'll be right out.

<b>			PANES
</b>			(over Sally)
		Come on in.

<b>			SKYE
</b>		I'm in the same room with Sally Nash.  Oh
		my God.  You're my icon.  I've been
		watching your films since I was a little
		girl.  Like, four years ago I followed
		you all around the Beverly Center - at
		least half a day, working up the courage
		to introduce myself.

	Joe enters the kitchen, watches.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		I don't think I ever spent half a day in
		the Beverly Center.

<b>			SKYE
</b>		Whatever, do you remember?  I've seen all
		your movies.  When I was in rehab, the
		second time, they wouldn't even let us
		see your drug addict movie.  They said
		you were too real.  I worship you.  And I
		couldn't be more flattered, because I
		know the part I'm playing in Joe's movie
		is based on you as a young woman.

	Joe winces, uncomfortable, picks up the bottle of wine and
	leaves.

<b>			SKYE (CONT'D)
</b>		And I'm overwhelmed.  And I want to do it
		justice.  And I hope we can spend time
		together.  And I'm gushing.  It's my
		worst quality.

<b>			PANES
</b>		Not at all.

<b>			SKYE
</b>		Oh my god.  I've been so rude.  I'm Skye
		Davidson.  Has anyone ever told you, you
		look like Peter Sellers?

<b>			PANES
</b>		No, never.

<b>			SALLY
</b>			(overlapping Panes)
		Everyday.

<b>			PANES
</b>		I'm Levi Panes.  Will you excuse us,
		Skye?  It's time for Sally's meds.

	Panes steers Sally out of the kitchen.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		It's nice to meet you... again.

	They go.  Skye is left in the kitchen alone.

<b>			SKYE
</b>			(to America)
		Oh my God, she remembers me!

<b>	INT. FOYER - MEDIUM CLOSE
</b>
	Sally and Panes start down the hall in search of privacy.

<b>			SALLY
</b>			(under her breath)
		Thank you, thank you, thank you.

<b>			CLAIR
</b>			(on the way down; a dream in
			 white)
		My God, your wardrobe is incredible.  It
		took me forever to decide.  Oh, and I
		found Dr. X, thank you.  You saved my
		life.

	She moves past them.

<b>			SALLY
</b>			(a moment; sotto)
		Shit!

<b>			PANES
</b>			(re: the dress)
		I'd cut off her red wine if I were you.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Shit.  It's my Galiano.

<b>			PANES
</b>		What does that mean?

<b>			SALLY
</b>		About five thousand dollars.  With my
		discount.

	The CAMERA follows them into the bedroom.  They flop down
	onto the bed and into FRAME.

<b>	INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	More guests have arrived.  Sophia and her children play with
	Otis.  America and Rosa pass round hot hors d'oeuvres.

	Joe places Gina's photo on the mantelpiece.

<b>			GINA
</b>			(regards him)
		Directing suits you.

<b>			JOE
</b>		I'm not so sure.  Look again in three
		months.

<b>			GINA
</b>		It must be nice having so many strangers
		kiss your ass all of a sudden.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Ow!  Gina, you obviously need to get
		fucked.

<b>			GINA
</b>		Just did.  Jealous?

<b>			JOE
</b>		When does he graduate high school?

<b>			GINA
</b>			(laughing)
		Oh, very jealous.

	Joe laughs.

<b>			GINA (CONT'D)
</b>		I saw Lucy when I was in London, she
		seems okay.  It's hard to tell with her.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Shit, I forgot to call her back.  She's
		off on a trip somewhere.  Oh God, my
		grandad's flat in London's been sold.

<b>			GINA
</b>		In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a
		meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.

<b>			JOE
</b>		I should have damn well bought it.  Well,
		we can't afford it.  The movie's going to
		eat up a year of my life and I'm getting
		paid next to nothing.  Do you know how
		much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four
		million.

<b>			GINA
</b>		Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow
		job.

<b>			JOE
</b>		You really need to be fucked.

<b>	INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
<b>			SALLY
</b>		So how are you really doing, Panes?

<b>			PANES
</b>		Why don't you go fuck yourself?

<b>			SALLY
</b>			(laughs)
		No.  Really.  For real.  Really.

<b>			PANES
</b>		I'm worried about your Galiano.

<b>			SALLY
</b>			(slaps him)
		You're a shit.

<b>			PANES
</b>		No, really, five thousand with your
		discount.

	He rolls out from under her swat, she misses him.

<b>			PANES (CONT'D)
</b>		You hurt, you know.  You're stronger than
		you think.

	They lie prone across the bed, about a foot apart.
	Contemplating the floor.

<b>			PANES (CONT'D)
</b>			(finally)
		How's the movie going?  Your movie.  You
		are making a movie, aren't you?

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Yes.  Fine.

<b>			PANES
</b>		That's it?  Yes.  Fine?

<b>			SALLY
</b>		I don't want to talk about it.

<b>			PANES
</b>		Why not?

<b>			SALLY
</b>		I never like to talk about my work.

<b>			PANES
</b>		Alright.  Well, that's something new.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		No.  Not something new.

<b>			PANES
</b>		Well, something's wrong.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Nothing's wrong.  It's great, okay?
		Having the time of my life.  Mac's a
		fantastic director.  And what can anyone
		say about Cal that hasn't been said.  And
		it's great working with friends, blah
		blah blah.

<b>			PANES
</b>			(a moment; little smile)
		Um.  Happy for you.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Thanks.

<b>			PANES
</b>		So tell me, how's it going?

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Oh you know.  No doubts.  No second
		thoughts.  Am I a monster?

<b>			PANES
</b>		You're my best friend.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		That's not an answer, is it?

<b>			PANES
</b>		Yes, you're a monster.

	She takes his hand.  Sounds of the party come from below.

<b>			SALLY
</b>			(a moment)
		Thank you, Panes.

<b>			PANES
</b>		You don't need to thank me.

<b>			SALLY
</b>			(another moment)
		We're going to have to go back out there.

<b>			PANES
</b>		I guess.

	But neither of them moves.

	SANFORD JEWISON is at the piano playing his own stuff,

	through the French doors at the pool, alone, a glass of

		I'm Jeffrey.

<b>			MONICA
</b>		Monica.

<b>			JEFFREY
</b>		And you know our friends, how?

<b>			MONICA
</b>		We live next door.

<b>			JEFFREY
</b>		Oh.  You're them.

<b>			MONICA
</b>		Excuse me?

</b>		We've heard lots about you.

	Judy Adams lost herself a little, steps outside, sits

		Hi.

<b>			RYAN
</b>		Hi.  A little close in there.

<b>			JUDY
</b>		Yup.

<b>	INT. MUSIC LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	A small, narrow room.  Not much more than an alcove.  With
	space for a desk, stereo equipment, and shelves packed with
	CDs.  The topmost shelf is a line of record albums.

	Joe's picking through the CDs.  Monica wanders in from the
	living room, toting a glass of champagne... watches him for a
	moment.

<b>			MONICA
</b>		Your Eames table is incredible.  And the
		B&amp;B.  I just put that in a client's home,
		actually, but in red.

<b>			JOE
</b>		You're an interior decorator, right?

<b>			MONICA
</b>			(nods)
		Sally did all this herself?

<b>			JOE
</b>		In fits and starts -- and then, later, of
		course, she had to accommodate me.  So
		things shifted a little bit then, became
		more eclectic.  And it keeps changing.

<b>			MONICA
</b>			(somehow at a loss)
		Mmm.  It says something about the two of
		you maybe.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux.
			(re: champagne)
		I see you've moved up from the soft
		stuff.

<b>			MONICA
</b>		Oh, yes.  You know Ryan's been sober
		eight years.  And it's difficult if I...
		you know.  It's better if I don't.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Uh-huh.

<b>			MONICA
</b>		I'm a little nervous, so...

<b>			JOE
</b>		Oh.

<b>			MONICA
</b>		A little out of my element.

<b>			JOE
</b>		No you're not.

<b>			MONICA
</b>		Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on
		the outside, yes.  And there's been all
		this friction.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Hm.

<b>			MONICA
</b>		I don't know why, but these
		misunderstandings have a way of
		escalating.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Very well put.

<b>			MONICA
</b>		I think a lot of this could have been
		avoided if Sally made more of an effort.

<b>			JOE
</b>		What?

<b>			MONICA
</b>		But you're very private people.  You
		know, there's a kind of elitism...

<b>			JOE
</b>			(pissed)
		Elitism?

<b>			MONICA
</b>		The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that.
		And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.

<b>			JOE
</b>		And you know, he really does not.

<b>			MONICA
</b>		And Ryan works at home.

<b>			JOE
</b>		And your phone calls are nasty and
		abusive.  And I've come this close to
		suing you for harassment.  And you're
		only here because we're supposed to be
		sucking up to you.

	Her eyes well with tears.

<b>			JOE (CONT'D)
</b>		Oh shit.  I'm sorry.

<b>			MONICA
</b>		Well, that's what Ryan thought.  I was
		more generous, actually.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Oh shit.  I'm sorry.  I'm a total fucking
		maniac.  Delete all that, okay?  I spoke
		for myself, this needn't rub off on my
		wife.  Oh shit.  I get pissy sometimes.
		Much worse than Otis.  Otis doesn't bite.
		It's just, I really love my dog and he
		doesn't really bark a lot.
		We live in a canyon.  We hear dogs
		barking at night, too.  And it's not
		Otis.

	Monica starts to laugh.

<b>			MONICA
</b>		Alright.

	It appears she's consumed more than one glass of champagne.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Easy tiger.

<b>			MONICA
</b>		Alright.  Please don't tell Ryan I'm
		drinking.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Scout's honor.

<b>			MONICA
</b>			(grins)
		I'll be your best friend.

	She feels they've bonded.  She pulls a well-thumbed copy of
	Joe's novel from her purse.

<b>			MONICA (CONT'D)
</b>		Would you sign it for me.
			(digs for a pen)
		I'm sure this is inappropriate.

<b>			JOE
</b>		We're way past inappropriate.

	Monica giggles, presses back the bubble rising in her chest
	and moving toward her throat.  Manages not to burp.

<b>			MONICA
</b>			(as he signs it)
		I'll treasure this.

	He moves towards the doorway, Monica at his heals.

<b>			JOE
</b>		I need to leave you now.

<b>			MONICA
</b>		I will treasure this.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Panes?

<b>			PANES
</b>		From Jewish Folk Poetry, a song cycle...

<b>			MAC
</b>		What?

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Trust him.

<b>			PANES
</b>		It's Shostakovich.

	Ryan spots his book on the shelf and pulls it out, delighted.

</b>		The Wind Up Bird Chronicle.

<b>			SALLY
</b>			(turns to him)
		Ryan?

<b>			RYAN
</b>			(pleased)
		I didn't know you had this.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You

</b>		Good idea.

</b>		Why last?

<b>			MONICA
</b>		The Katzenjammer Kids.

	There's a hush.

</b>		You know.  It's the Funnies.  The

		It's alright.  Be our guests.

	Panes mimes a belly laugh.

	Panes sighs.

</b>		Two words.

	He belly laughs.

	Panes does an "ON THE NOSE."  Gets on all fours.  Licks his

</b>		To, the, but, or...

	Jerry shakes his head.  Goes to the third word.

<b>			TEAM (CONT'D)
</b>		Third word.  One syllable.

	Jerry pulls his ear, "sounds like".  Slides his finger
	through the O created by his thumb and forefinger.

<b>			TEAM (CONT'D)
</b>		Fuck...sounds like... Fork.  Flock...

	he does the finger sign again.

<b>			TEAM (CONT'D)
</b>		Fuck.  Folk.

	Jerry gives them "on the nose."

<b>			TEAM (CONT'D)
</b>		Second word.

</b>		Second word.

	He strokes his beard again.

	Jerry looks at her, amazed.  She stands, throws hands up in

	Panes finds room next to Skye.

<b>			PANES
</b>		Is there space here?

<b>			SKYE
</b>		Yes.

<b>			PANES
</b>		Do you need anything else?

<b>			SKYE
</b>		No, no thanks.

	He sits on the floor along side her.  They eat in silence for
	a moment.

<b>			PANES
</b>			(finally)
		I was impressed.

<b>			SKYE
</b>		Oh?

<b>			PANES
</b>		The charades.

<b>			SKYE
</b>		Thank you.

<b>			PANES
</b>		That was my clue.

<b>			SKYE
</b>		Oh?

<b>			PANES
</b>		The Shostakovich.

<b>			SKYE
</b>		Really??

<b>			PANES
</b>			(does Seller's Indian)
		Oh yes, indeed.  That was my clue, you
		see.

	Skye giggles appreciative response.

<b>			PANES (CONT'D)
</b>			(still Indian)
		So you are well acquainted with this
		Shostackovich, as am I.

	Other arrivals pick their way through bodies and plates.
	Walk over to Sally and kiss her cheek.  Joe and Gina and
	Jeffrey sit off to the side.

<b>			JOE
</b>		I hate the idea of some one else living
		in it.

	Joe pulls Sally to him and wraps his arms around her.

<b>			JOE (CONT'D)
</b>		Sally's never even seen it.  I thought
		we'd raise our kids there.

	Sally held in Joe's arms, smiles.  The cat who ate the
	canary.

<b>			JOE (CONT'D)
</b>		Have I ever told you how Lucy and I
		nearly squashed each other getting into
		the dumb waiter.

<b>			GINA/JEFFREY/SALLY
</b>		Yes./Often./I stopped counting.

<b>			JOE
</b>		The dumb waiter was our...

<b>			GINA
</b>		Escape hatch.

<b>			JOE
</b>			(eyes her)
		Escape hatch.  And Dad was having a go
		about the garden.  Something was
		misplanted...

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Not properly watered.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Whatever!
			(to Gina)
		You know how he gets.  Well, he went
		absolutely bonkers.  Lucy and I were
		frantically trying to scramble into the
		dumb waiter and I didn't fit any more.
		It was almost fatal.  And that, my dear
		friends, is the day...

<b>			SALLY/JEFFREY
</b>		I realized I had become a man.  Ta da!

<b>			GINA
</b>		You're not a man, Joe.  You're a boy.

<b>			JOE
</b>			(childishly)
		So?

<b>			GINA
</b>			(laughs)
		I love you, Joe Therrian.

<b>			SALLY
</b>			(at a loss, small)
		Me too.

	Sophia watches from across the living room.

<b>	NEW ANGLE
</b>
<b>	INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Astrid squeezes in next to Sally, on her second portion of
	everything.  She allows Anouk to nibble from her plate.

<b>			ASTRID
</b>		You're not upset that I brought the dog?

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Would it make a difference?

<b>			ASTRID
</b>		Anouk isn't like a dog, really.  More
		like a small person.  So is there anyone
		here for me?  No one looks new.
			(fixes on Ryan)
		Who's that?

<b>			SALLY
</b>		You don't want that.  It's married and
		it's the neighbor.

<b>			ASTRID
</b>		Oh I think he's cute.  How's the marriage
		part working out?

<b>			SALLY
</b>		You're fucking desperate.

<b>			ASTRID
</b>		Like you didn't know.
			(re: Skye)
		Who invited the bimbo?

<b>			SALLY
</b>		One guess.

<b>	INT. LIVING ROOM
</b>
	The CAMERA stays close on the cake as America wheels the cart
	into the living room.  The top of it sports Sally and Joe's
	faces on either side of Otis, a detailed edible photograph.
	There are three sixes across the top.

	There's a freed up pathway.  Cal taps the side of his
	champagne glass with a fork.

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>			(re: the cake as it comes in)
		Part of our gift.  Honey!!

<b>			CAL
</b>			(clinks his glass)
		Here, here.

	Clair picks up discarded dinner plates.  Otis takes care of
	those behind couches, under tables.

	The gifts are stacked high, near the fireplace.  Sally is on
	the floor, nestled between Joe's knees, leaning back against
	him.  His arms are wrapped around her, face pressed against
	hers.

	There's a SERIES OF CUTS through speeches, gifts,
	entertainment.  Sophia and Cal do a well rehearsed, very
	funny, impromptu something with their kids.

	Panes and Mac do an interpretive dance symbolizing the
	marriage.

	Cal and Sophia carry sleeping children down the hall.

	There are speeches about Sally and Joe, outrageously dirty,
	funny, sometimes touching - that cover their recent
	separation, the custody of Otis, their trying to have a
	baby...

	Panes plays a piece on the violin.  Someone else sings.  And
	finally...

<b>	MEDIUM CLOSE - SKYE
</b>
	She looks out at the guests...

<b>	NEW ANGLE
</b>
	They look back at her.

<b>			SKYE
</b>		I wasn't prepared to say anything.  I'm
		honored to be a part of tonight.  To be
		in the same room, with my favorite living
		actress...

	The CAMERA barely catches the grimace on Mac's face; Clair
	elbows him.

<b>			SAM
</b>			(sings out)
		Still living.

<b>			SKYE
</b>		And my favorite novelist.  And all their
		amazing --

<b>			SAM
</b>			(sings out)
		And talented.

<b>			SKYE
</b>		Friends.  And talented friends.  This
		room is so filled with love..

<b>			ASTRID
</b>			(sings out)
		And the winner is...

<b>			PANES
</b>		Let the woman speak.

<b>			SKYE
</b>		And I brought a gift of love.  A gift
		that is love.

	She pulls an envelope from behind her back, which she's
	decorated in flower-child fashion; it harkens back to the
	sixties, puts it into Sally's hand, kisses her cheek.

<b>			SKYE (CONT'D)
</b>			(tears up)
		Happy anniversary.  Thank you for making
		me a part of it.

<b>			SALLY
</b>			(pours the pills into her hand)
		What are they?

<b>			JOE
</b>			(pleased, surprised)
		Dolphins.  Great.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		It's ecstasy, Sal.

<b>			SKYE
</b>		I think there are sixteen there.

<b>			JOE
</b>			(kisses Skye)
		This is an amazing present.  What a
		sweetheart you are.

	Skye's pleased she's made him happy.

<b>			SALLY
</b>			(regards Joe; to Skye)
		What a sweetheart you are.

	A pall descends on the party.  There's a FULL SHOT of the
	group.  Nobody quite knows what to do.  There's torn wrapping
	paper all over the room.

<b>			ASTRID
</b>			(Anouk still in her lap)
		It's late.
			(kisses Anouk)
		You sleepy baby?

	There are awkward excuses.  Some of the guests leave.

<b>	INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
	The core group remains.

<b>			JOE
</b>		I think we should all take it tonight.
		Everyone's staying, stays.  No driving.
		That's the rule.  I love you Sally-Mae.
		You're going to have a fabulous time.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		I'm worried about my spine.  I'm very
		worried about my brain and my spine.

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>			(laughs)
		Oh honey, you're gonna love it.

<b>			JOE
</b>			(to her Look)
		Sophia's going to do it, Panes is going
		to do it, trust me.

<b>	INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	Cal carries the envelope into the room.

<b>			CAL
</b>			(on seeing America, bursts
			 into)
		America, America God shed his light on
		me.

	He dances her around the kitchen, he picks up the sterling
	dish, arranges the pills, carries them back to the living
	room.

<b>	INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	Ecstasy is passed from guest to guest.  Ryan expects Monica
	to abstain.

<b>			MONICA
</b>			(his glare; simply)
		I want to try it, Ryan.

<b>	EXT. POOL - LATER
</b>
	The drug has begun to take effect.  The party is now in full
	swing.  Music is playing, and Sophia and Clair are dancing.

	People are swimming, some naked, some in swimsuits.  Judy
	floats around the pool on an inflatable dog.

	Sally and Skye cuddle together on one of the benches round
	the pool, chatting; a friendly, feely touchy conversation.
	Joe passes around bottles of water and chewing gum to
	everyone, emceeing the event.

	Everyone is relaxed and open, except Ryan, who sits beside
	Monica at the edge of the garden, separated from the others.

<b>			MONICA
</b>		I love it here.  Don't you love it here,
		Ryan?  I love it here.  And I love
		tonight.  And I love these people.  And
		this feels utterly fantastic, Ryan.
			(touches her own cheek, ever so
			 lightly; shivers against the
			 sensation)
		Utterly fantastic.

<b>			RYAN
</b>		You know what Sally Therrian was saying
		about your spine and your brain?  She
		didn't pull that out of thin air.  It
		causes brain damage.  You'd better drink
		a lot of water.

<b>			MONICA
</b>		Do you want to go home, Ryan?

<b>			RYAN
</b>		Yes.

<b>			MONICA
</b>		I think you should then.  You should look
		in on Sheila.

<b>			RYAN
</b>		I'm not going to leave you alone.

<b>			MONICA
</b>		They're really nice people, Ryan.
		They're like us...

<b>			RYAN
</b>		They're nothing like us.

<b>			MONICA
</b>		I think you need to speak for yourself,
		Ryan.  But I think you're really nice
		people...

	She puts arms around him, kisses his cheek.  He stiffens.

<b>			RYAN
</b>		Are you making an ass of yourself?

<b>			MONICA
</b>		There's only you, Ryan.  You know what,
		Ryan?  You're beautiful.  I love you so
		much... You need...

<b>			RYAN
</b>		I don't need a drug.

<b>			MONICA
</b>		You need a good review and you'll be
		fine.  The whole color of the world will
		change, mark my words.

	She gets up.

<b>			RYAN
</b>		Ready to go?

<b>			MONICA
</b>		I'm going to go get my swimsuit.  I do
		know, Ryan, this is non addictive so you
		mustn't worry.
			(turns back)
		Ryan, you're a great man.

	The CAMERA follows Monica along the side of the pool.  She
	passes Sophia and a very exuberant Clair.

	The CAMERA stays at the pool.  Clair tears off Sally's
	Galiano, flings it to the ground and dives topless into the
	pool.

<b>			CLAIR
</b>		This water is great!

<b>			JERRY
</b>			(swimming past her)
		Wanna dive for a baton?

<b>	MEDIUM CLOSE UP - JUDY
</b>
	She stands at the side of the pool.

<b>			JUDY
</b>		Okay, I'm about to throw five colored
		batons in the water.  Then I'm going to
		count to three, and then you may start
		diving.  I'm playing too.  The red one is
		ten extra points.  Ready?
			(she throws batons in)
		One, two, three, go!!

	There is a melee of diving and screaming.

<b>						   CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	EXT. BACKYARD LANDING
</b>
	It's at the end of a bridge, overlooking the pool.  Voices
	drift up from below.  Mac and Joe walk in circles pacing
	around one another.

<b>			MAC
</b>		You got your DP?

<b>			JOE
</b>		What?  Oh yeah, the camera man?  They
		gave me a list.

<b>			MAC
</b>		And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big
		leagues for a first timer.  Do you even
		like movies?

<b>			JOE
</b>		Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God
		I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet,
		Mac?

<b>			MAC
</b>		Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver
		Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're
		friends.  And great DP's I could give
		them a call for you.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Thanks, Mac.
			(regards him)
		And thanks for being so supportive about
		all this.
			(throws arm around him, hugs
			 him close)
		I really love you, you know.

<b>			MAC
</b>		Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.  Anything
		I can do.

<b>			JOE
</b>			(lets go of Mac)
		God, I really need to jump about a bit.
			(begins jumping)
		How's your film going?

<b>			CAL
</b>		It's going.  It's going.

<b>			JOE
</b>		And how's the diva doing?

<b>			MAC
</b>		Well, you know...good days, bad days.

<b>			JOE
</b>		I meant Sally.

<b>			MAC
</b>		I meant Sally.

<b>			JOE
</b>			(stops jumping, studies him)
		Oh.  You're serious.

<b>			MAC
</b>			(throws and arm around him)
		No.  No.
			(a beat)
		Let me tell you something.  Directing's
		the best preparation possible for
		fatherhood.  The sleep depravation alone.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Oh don't.  Everyone says that.

<b>	INT. MUSIC LIBRARY
</b>
	Sally's taken Gina's photograph of them from the mantelpiece
	in the living room, and looks for a spot for it on the CD
	shelves.  Sophia is studying the CDs very intently.  They are
	both bopping to the music.

<b>			SALLY
</b>			(re: the photograph)
		Isn't this a fabulous picture?

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		Yes.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		She's such a great photographer.

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		Hm.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		So where should I put it?

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		I thought it was okay where it was.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		It's much more personal in here.

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		A notch above the storage room.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		We're always in here.
			(regards the photo)
		She really gets him, doesn't she?

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		The both of you.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		But she really gets to the heart of Joe,
		doesn't she?  She's a genius.

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		So how much do you hate her?

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Big time.

	They both laugh, then...

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		Well, I don't trust her.  I never have.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		She took our wedding photos, for
		chrissakes.  You don't trust anyone.

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>			(a moment simply)
		I trust you.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Oh Soph...

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		You'll hate it in London.  It's wet and
		miserable.  A medical hellhole Sally.
		It's socialized.  Beds in the corridors.
		Terrible plumbing.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		And the food sucks, I know.

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		You are not having your baby in London.
		You're going to have your baby at Cedars
		in Beverly Hills, America, delivered by
		Dr. Milton Cohen.  Period.
		And you're getting that epidural right
		away, don't let anyone talk you into any
		of that Lamase bullshit.  There's no
		excuse for pain like that.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Sophia!  I'm not even pregnant!

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		Well good.  Thank God.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Let's go in the kitchen and spy on
		everyone.

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		Oh honey, let's.

	They've started to walk through the house.

<b>			SALLY
</b>			(stops short; turns to her)
		What do you mean, thank God?

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		Well, are you sure about this baby thing?
		It's not the ticking clock shit, is it?

<b>			SALLY
</b>		No, no, not at all... I mean I've still
		got plenty of time.  Don't I?  I mean I
		still have a good six years, whatever.
		We could have three kids yet, if we
		wanted.  And I know I've always said I
		never wanted kids, and I didn't... but
		this year, I really, truly, feel ready...

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		Honey, I'm not worried about you.  You
		are going to be a fantastic mom.  Not an
		issue.  I pressed you, remember?  Joe, on
		the other hand, is a different story.

<b>			SALLY
</b>			(laughs)
		Oh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids.
		Joe thinks he needs kids.

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		He wants playmates.  Oh he's a
		sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him.
		But he's not going to be a good father.
		He's just not parenting material.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Hey, let's sit down.  I bet the rug feels
		really nice against your skin.

	Sally drops out of frame.

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		Don't try and change the subject.
			(sitting, joining Sally)
		Oh God, it feels great!  He's just a
		little narcissistic, irresponsible and
		unreliable.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		And Cal's this massive adult?

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how
		happy Joe was when the drugs came out
		tonight?

<b>			SALLY
</b>		You weren't exactly horrified.

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>			(laughing)
		I don't have a drug problem.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Neither does Joe.

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		His sister does.  Big time.  And the New
		York Times says addiction is genetic --
		I'll e-mail you the article.

	Sally stares at her friend suddenly mute, eyes wide.

<b>			SOPHIA (CONT'D)
</b>		You don't have kids to keep a marriage
		together, Sally.  It's only five months
		since Joe came back.

<b>			SALLY
</b>			(getting up)
		We're fine.  We're great.  We're having a
		baby and we're moving to London.

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>			(following her)
		Well, you weren't fine last summer when
		you went Sylvia Plath on me in
		Connecticut.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Not nice.  Not kind.

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		Ha!  Not half so not kind as your husband
		was in his portrayal of you in his novel.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Why are you doing this?

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		His image of you is a possessive, fragile
		neurotic.

<b>			SALLY
</b>			(tearing up)
		But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>			(also tearing up)
		No you are not.  You're Sally Nash.
		Listen to me, you're Sally Nash.  You're
		my best friend and I love you more than
		anyone, and you're not going to move to
		London to have the offspring of a
		sexually ambivalent man-child.  "Oh now
		I'm a novelist, oh now I'm a director..."
		English prick bastard Joe Therrian who's
		probably going to leave you for Skye
		Davidson anyway.

	They hug a bit weepy.

<b>			SOPHIA (CONT'D)
</b>		He's always one step removed, always
		looking over his shoulder always looking
		for something else, something more
		intoxicating, and I don't mean drugs.  I
		love him, Sal, but he's a child.  He's
		not ready.
			(a choked sob, tears well and
			 fall)
		Oh God, you're so lucky you don't have
		kids.  You can't stick your head in the
		oven.  You can't take a handful of
		Percoden if you want to, or slit your
		wrists.  You can't do yourself in.  Kids
		rob you of that option.  Trust me.
			(a beat)
		Oh my God, this ecstacy must be really
		good.

<b>	EXT. POOL SIDE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	Joe and Cal sit by the edge of the pool watching Skye dance
	by herself at the far end.  Joe has his hand on Cal's chest.
	Cal is stroking Joe's hair.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Isn't Skye amazing?

<b>			CAL
</b>		She's got great tits.

<b>			JOE
</b>		She's a constant surprise.

<b>			CAL
</b>		And you've only just met.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty
		seven and...
			(taps his head)
		The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew
		that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice?

<b>			CAL
</b>		Absolutely.  And she's got great tits.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Yeah, God she really does have great
		tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work
		with her.

<b>			CAL
</b>		The camera loves her.  A great actress.

<b>			JOE
</b>		With great tits.  I'm going to ask her if
		I can touch them.

	He gets up to go towards Skye, is stopped by...

<b>	EXT. MEDIUM SHOT - CLAIR
</b>
	Clair is climbing up the pool steps.

<b>			CLAIR
</b>		Has anyone seen Mac?

<b>			JOE
</b>			(pointing further up the
			 property)
		I saw him wandering over there, I think.
		How're you feeling, Clair?

<b>			CLAIR
</b>		I'm so good.

	She kisses Joe and Cal, and goes off to find her husband.

<b>			CAL
</b>		Poor Mac.  It's been a bit of a struggle.
		I'm sure Sally's told you.

<b>			JOE
</b>		No, what?

<b>			CAL
</b>		The movie.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think.
		Is Mac okay?

<b>			CAL
</b>		I don't know what's going on.  I don't
		care to guess.  Mac's really unhappy.
		She isn't there, that's all.  She's no
		idea what she's playing, not a clue.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Who, Sally?

<b>			CAL
</b>		And, you know it isn't rocket science,
		this script.  She can barely get the
		lines out.  There was a scene last week -
		she sobbed, through every take.  I know
		crying's easy for her but it's a fucking
		comedy, Joe.  Something's gone.  You
		know, that thing that was Sally - that
		always surprised you.  It's gone.  I
		think she's scared.  And that's death.

<b>			JOE
</b>		I still think she sails above the rest.
		I mean not like her early films.  But
		those were all such great directors.

<b>			CAL
</b>		Mac's a pretty great director, Joe.  He's
		a woman's director.  And nothing's
		happening.  Course he won't fire her,
		because of the friendship... But it was
		discussed.  He had to battle his studio
		to get her in the first place.

<b>			JOE
</b>		What?

<b>			CAL
</b>		Hey, listen, I love her.  She's Sophia's
		best friend.
			(to Joe's stare)
		I never said any of this, alright.  I'll
		deny it on the stand...
			(into the silence)
		You guys are gonna have kids.  That is so
		great.  Maybe that's what this is all
		about.  Maybe she doesn't want to do this
		anymore.  You know adults don't do this
		for a living.  You guys are gonna have
		your kids, you'll be directing -- one
		asshole in the family is enough.  Sophia
		knew that intuitively.  Look at Clair.
		Clair's a mess.
			(throws an arm around him)
		Make sure she gets the epidural.  Forget
		that natural childbirth shit.
		Everything's going to be what it's
		supposed to be.  "Life is but a walking
		shadow.  A poor player who struts and
		frets his hour upon the stage and then is
		heard no more..." And speaking of me, the
		role of Leo in your film?

<b>			JOE
</b>			(stares at him)
		Leo?

<b>			CAL
</b>		Any thoughts on casting yet?

<b>			JOE
</b>			(regards him)
		Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude
		passed.

<b>			CAL
</b>		Well, I can't make any promises, and of
		course I haven't read the script but I
		loved the novel...when are you shooting?

<b>			JOE
</b>		October-ish.

<b>			CAL
</b>		I have a small window of time.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Leo.  Leo's twenty-eight, Cal.

<b>			CAL
</b>		Scratch the two, write in a four.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Scratch the two, write in a four.

<b>			CAL
</b>		You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty
		nine.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Five years ago, I was at the party,
		remember?

	Joe looks up and sees Sally standing in the sun room.  He
	blows her a kiss.  She kisses her finger tips and puts her
	hand flat against the window pane.

<b>	INT. BEDROOM CLOSET - TIGHT CLOSE - SALLY
</b>
	She's in her wardrobe pacing back and forth a bit frantic.
	Trying on clothing, tossing garments to the ground.  The
	floor is a heap of discarded ideas.  She pulls on jeans and a
	t-shirt.  Very similar to what Skye is wearing.  She sits a
	moment on the floor.  The sounds of the party below are
	muted.

<b>			SALLY (O.S.)
</b>		Oh Warren, that was awful, I can't sing.

	The CAMERA stays with Sally as she gets to her feet, walks
	along the corridor, toward the sound of her voice.

<b>	INT. DAILIES ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Mac is on the edge of the couch, elbows on knees, staring at
	the television screen - watching his dailies.  At some point
	he drops his head.  Stops watching...

<b>	INT. MOVIE SET
</b>
<b>			CAL'S VOICE FROM THE T.V. (O.S.)
</b>		You sing like a bird.

<b>			SALLY'S VOICE FROM THE T.V. (O.S.)
</b>		A bird with dropsy.  A caged bird.  That
		hasn't long to live.

<b>			CAL'S VOICE FROM THE T.V. (O.S)
</b>		You seem so alive up there.

	Sally stands at the open door.  Stunned.  Watches Mac watch
	her.  Watches herself, with a professional, acute eye.  More
	critical than Mac's could ever be.

<b>			SALLY (ON TV)
</b>		I was faking it.  I've been feeling caged
		for sometime.  Funny, huh?

<b>			MAC
</b>			(moans)
		No, it's not... Fuck fuck fuck fuck.

<b>	INT. CORRIDOR - CLOSE SHOT - SALLY
</b>
	She backs up into the corridor mortified.  Leans against the
	wall.

<b>			CAL'S VOICE FROM THE T.V. (O.S.)
</b>		It's preposterous.  You're free to do
		whatever you like.

<b>			SALLY'S VOICE FROM THE T.V.
</b>		Yes, well, we'll see won't we?

<b>			MAC (O.S.)
</b>		Jesus Christ.

<b>			SALLY
</b>			(a deep breath)
		Well...wow...

<b>	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

</b>		You can cut around it, whatever it is.
		You always do.

<b>			MAC
</b>		Not this time.

</b>		It's always not this time.  If you can do

		You don't have any clothes on.

<b>			CLAIR
</b>		How nice for everybody.  Come swimming.
		The water's glorious.
			(re: the film)
		You'll fix it.  You'll come up with one

<b>			MAC
</b>		Or I won't.  I can't help her.  I'm out

<b>			CLAIR
</b>		Things always look much worse in the

<b>			MAC
</b>		I don't know how to make her funny.

<b>			CLAIR
</b>		You're coming swimming in the pool, and
		in a few minutes you won't even remember

</b>		Are you okay?

<b>			MONICA

<b>			MONICA
</b>		I'm a little in the puke zone.

</b>			(giving her some water)
		Here, drink this.  Drink lots of water.
			(puts the bottle in her hand)
		Hold on to this.  Take deep breaths.
		Nice and slow.
			(sits her down; produces a

		Would you like a lolly?

<b>			MONICA
</b>		What am I, five?

<b>			JOE
</b>		You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm

<b>			MONICA
</b>			(a grin)
		Okay.

	He pulls out another one.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Lemon or raspberry?

<b>			MONICA
</b>		Lemon.

</b>		Lemon it is.

	The two suck on their lollipops for a moment.

</b>			(finally)
		Ryan's really angry with me.

<b>			JOE
</b>		I think he's really angry with me too.

<b>			MONICA
</b>			(laughs)
		It's really not the same thing.
			(a moment)
		He was really nicer when he drank.

<b>			JOE
</b>		I'm sorry.

<b>			MONICA
</b>		Eight years, though.  That's quite an

<b>			JOE
</b>		That's a lot of those.

</b>		Medallions.

<b>			JOE
</b>		A lot of cakes.

<b>			MONICA
</b>		Yes.

<b>			JOE
</b>		And he doesn't smoke?

<b>			MONICA
</b>		He has to find non-smoker's meetings that
		used to be almost impossible, you know?
		It's gotten much better.

<b>			JOE
</b>		How long have you been married?

<b>			MONICA
</b>		Nine...nine, yes?  Nine years, just
		about.

<b>			JOE
</b>		You must have been a baby.

<b>			MONICA
</b>		Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.
			(a moment)
		I'm cold.

</b>		Come here.

	Joe holds Monica.

<b>			MONICA
</b>			(a moment)
		That's very nice.

<b>			JOE
</b>		I like you.

<b>			MONICA
</b>		I'm so glad.  You know, I recognize that

		running into each other in the movie
		theatre.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Sorry?

<b>			MONICA
</b>		I know you changed it to a bookstore.
		And the color of my hair.  But the moment
		was exactly the same.  The same, you
		know, dynamic.  And almost verbatim,
		wasn't it?

<b>			JOE
</b>			(humors her)
		Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's
		sacred.
			(thinks a moment)
		No, nothing at all.

<b>			MONICA
</b>		I think it's great that I made an
		impression at all, you know.

	Joe regards the open trusting face, is touched by it.  Leans
	in, kisses her lips very lightly... and again.  Her arms
	can't make up her mind, whether to come up around him or not.
	Finally do.

</b>		Otis!!  Otis, come!  Oh fuck!

</b>			(horrified)
		I'm sorry.

		There's a goddamn sign on the gate.

</b>		How long ago was it?

</b>		Stop being such a bitch, Sal.

</b>		I'm so sorry.

</b>		It was a mistake.  This isn't a plot to

</b>		Don't be so sure.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Listen to yourself...
			(to Monica)
		Don't worry, it's alright.  We'll find

			(to Sally)
		What's wrong with you?

<b>			SALLY
</b>			(re: Monica)
		She left the fucking gate open.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Well he can't have gone far.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Can't have gone far?  He's like a
		greyhound.  He could be miles away.

<b>			JOE
</b>		He'll find his way back.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		There are fucking coyotes out there.

<b>			JOE
</b>			(calming)
		Sally, calm down.  We're not going to

		A long time.

</b>		So you were here when they were doing the

<b>			AMERICA
</b>		Oh yes.

</b>		Did you know the contractor?

<b>			AMERICA
</b>		Very well.

<b>			RYAN
</b>		Was it a contractor?

</b>		It's the way they do things.

</b>		To code?

	Her back is to him.  She exchanges a glance with Rosa, and

</b>		You should talk to Mr. Joe.

	Monica bursts into the room.

</b>		Ryan, you've got to come!  You've got to

</b>		You're not serious.

</b>		God willing.

</b>		We have to find the dog, Ryan.

</b>		Why?

<b>			PANES
</b>		Otis!!  Shostakovich identified with the

		under the thumb of Stalinist imperialism.

<b>			SKYE
</b>		Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis,
		come!!

<b>			PANES
</b>		Andre Zhdanov?  How the hell do you know
		about Andre Zhdanov?

<b>			SKYE
</b>		Who doesn't know about the infamous
		composer's conference of 1948 where
		Zhdanov persecuted the leaders of Soviet

		Myaskovsky.

<b>			PANES
</b>		I'll tell you who doesn't know, cute

<b>			SKYE
</b>		Do Peter Sellers again.

<b>			PANES
</b>			(a la Sellers)
		Otis you crazy dog!  Otis are you in this
		God forsaken Canyon?  My people are very
		hungry.

<b>			SKYE
</b>		I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I
		played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who
		gets shot in the head, and they used
		Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.

<b>			PANES
</b>		Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!

<b>			SKYE
</b>		Exactly!  So I dug it, and I did a lot of
		research.

<b>			PANES
</b>		Do you really, you really, like
		Shostakovich?

<b>			SKYE
</b>		Yeah.

<b>			PANES
</b>		Would you, like, marry him?

<b>			SKYE
</b>		If he were still alive, maybe.

<b>			PANES
</b>		How about someone who really really liked
		Shostakovich?

<b>			SKYE
</b>			(smiling)
		Are you asking me to marry you?

<b>			PANES
</b>		No, I'm just testing to see how deeply

<b>			SKYE
</b>			(laughing)
		Very.

<b>			PANES
</b>		Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really

<b>			SKYE
</b>		Who told you that?  No.  I'm twenty...

	We hear them calling for Otis.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Otis!!!!

<b>			JOE
</b>			(on her heels)
		Otis!!!!

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Otis, good boy, come here.  Oh my god, oh
		my god, oh my god.

<b>			JOE
</b>		This is a nightmare.  We should have kept
		him upstairs.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		It was done.  When Sophia put the kids to
		bed, America brought Otis in the room and
		closed the door.  It was done.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Well someone clearly let him out before
		Monica opened the gate.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're
		at it.  But I guess that's what I
		interrupted.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Jesus, Sally.  You are a medical miracle.
		The only person who's ever taken ecstacy
		and become angrier.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Yeah, let's talk about that.  You seem to
		be rather an expert.  I don't remember in
		the last five months of counselling your
		ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage
		parties.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Rave parties?!  That's so typical - you
		would think it was called rage.  Perfect!

<b>			SALLY
</b>		What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's
		get really clear here.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Sally, so I took a few pills.  I went out
		dancing.  I tried to forget how upset I
		was about splitting up with you.  I
		haven't lied to you.  I told you about
		the people I've slept with.  I just
		didn't mention the few occasions I took
		drugs because you're so fucking
		judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end
		of it, and you have so little faith and
		so little trust in me.  Sally, we're
		back, I love you.  Trust that.  Please
		let's not do this.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Otis!  Come!  Good boy!  Come!

<b>			JOE
</b>		Otis!

<b>			SALLY
</b>		I'm not sure we understand that word in
		the same way.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Love?

<b>			SALLY
</b>		You walked out on a five year marriage.

<b>			JOE
</b>		That hasn't the first fucking thing to do
		with love.  It's whether we can live
		together... like this!  All the time.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		It's not like this all the time.

<b>			JOE
</b>		DO I want anyone else?  No.  Do I want to
		be with you for the rest of my natural
		life?  I'm trying.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		And how hard it hit?

<b>			JOE
</b>		Just stop right there, Sally.  We've been
		through this.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		You've been through it.  That's how you
		love people.  When it's easy for you,
		when it's convenient for you.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Sally, first of all, you're talking
		bullshit.  And second...

<b>			SALLY
</b>		You want to talk about bullshit?  Lucy
		called you three times this week.  She's
		a fucking mess, Joe.  Your sister is a
		fucking mess.  She needs you.  I talk to
		her more than you do.

<b>			JOE
</b>		That is not true.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		It is true.  You know how you love, Joe?
		You dedicate a book to someone.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Every novel I've had published in every
		language I've dedicated to Lucy.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Right.  And when was the last time you
		spoke to her?

	Joe is silent.

<b>			SALLY (CONT'D)
</b>		And how fucking dare you cast Skye
		Davidson in that part?  Have you any idea
		how humiliating that is for me?  I'm an
		actress!  It's about our marriage for
		fuck's sake.  Everybody knows that...

<b>			JOE
</b>		It's a novel.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		About me!

<b>			JOE
</b>		Who the fuck do you think you are?  The
		part of Genna is not just about you.
		It's about every woman I've ever loved in
		my entire life.  Including my mother.
		The character is also clearly in her
		early twenties, Sally.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		What are you saying?

<b>			JOE
</b>		Hello?  Last birthday was?

<b>			SALLY
</b>		I don't look my age, Joe.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Sally, I have never considered you for
		this part because you are too old to play
		it.  And you are out of touch with
		reality if you think differently.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		It's a shit novel anyway.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Well there you go.  I let you off the
		hook.  You're one goddamn lucky actress.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Not really.  I mean your books have
		always been pop, but this is the
		shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all
		our friends think, anyway.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle,
		stripped ten years off your face, still
		couldn't have got the thing made.
		Because I don't mean anything as a
		director, and your name doesn't mean fuck
		all anymore.  And the people that can
		hire you are afraid to, because they
		think you're phoning it in.  That you
		don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?

<b>			JOE
</b>		Your director and your co-star of your
		current movie.  Don't dish if you can't
		take it, Sally.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Mac?  Mac says it?  Cal?

	Joe doesn't respond.

<b>			SALLY (CONT'D)
</b>		Cal, too?

<b>			JOE
</b>		Sally, for Christ's sake.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Anyone else?

<b>			JOE
</b>		This is insanity.
			(moves toward her)
		Sally...

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Don't.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Don't push me away.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		I had an abortion two weeks ago.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Don't do this.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		I found out I was pregnant and it scared
		the shit out of me.

<b>			JOE
</b>			(threatens)
		Don't do this!

<b>			SALLY
</b>		I told you when we met I never wanted
		children.  I don't want kids in my life.
		We talked about it.  You weren't
		listening.

<b>			JOE
</b>		You changed your mind.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		I wanted you back.

	Joe slaps her hard across the face.

<b>			SALLY (CONT'D)
</b>		You think this was to hurt you?!  My God,
		Joe.  It isn't about you.

<b>			JOE
</b>		What?!  You aborted our child?!

<b>			SALLY
</b>		I'm a monster.  Exactly.

<b>			JOE
</b>		You're not ready.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Don't make allowances.  I'll never be
		ready.  Some people just shouldn't have
		children.  I'd be a terrible fucking
		mother, Joe.  I did want it for us.  But
		I couldn't do it.  I don't really think I
		can do it.

<b>			JOE
</b>		I wasn't part of that picture at all, was
		I?  I wasn't part of that decision.  Did
		I occur to you at all?  It's a fucking
		farce.  It's a fucking farce.  How long
		did you think you could keep it going.
		You're amazing.  Do you have any idea
		what you've done to us?

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Yes.

<b>			JOE
</b>		I'll never forgive you.

</b>			(laughs; shakes his head)
		Stupid tart.

<b>			GINA
</b>		She left a note.

<b>			JOE
</b>			(realizes the import; to Gina)
		Fuck you.

	Tears start down Sally's face.

<b>			GINA
</b>		You need to call your dad.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Leave us alone right now.

<b>			GINA
</b>		I've booked you a flight and packed you a
		bag.  You just need to get into a car and
		go.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Would you leave us alone right now?

<b>			GINA
</b>		I love her too, Joe.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Alright, good.  Thanks for your trouble.
		So will you leave Sally and me alone
		right now?

<b>			SALLY
</b>			(a shrug; simply)
		Everybody hates the messenger.

	Gina exits.

<b>			SALLY (CONT'D)
</b>			(to Joe)
		I'm coming with you.

	Joe starts to cry.  Sally holds him, kisses him, strokes him,
	rocks him.

<b>			JOE
</b>			(inconsolable)
		I don't want you to go.

	He wipes tears away that start afresh; his nose is running,
	he wipes that too.

<b>			JOE (CONT'D)
</b>		I can't got tonight.  I don't want to be
		on a plane on my own tonight.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		I'll be with you.

<b>			JOE
</b>		I don't want to go tonight.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		You don't have to.

	They sit on the floor.  Sally soothing, rocking Joe like a
	baby.

<b>			JOE
</b>			(bereft)
		Stupid tart.

<b>	INT. KITCHEN - LATER
</b>
	Gina's put up some coffee.  Sophia, Cal, Mac and Clair stand
	around awkwardly.  Sally comes into the room.

<b>			MAC
</b>		How's he doing?

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Not good.

<b>			GINA
</b>		He's gonna miss his flight.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Yeah.

	Al the guests are a little stunned.

<b>			GINA
</b>		Is he not going?  I booked a flight.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		He's not going tonight.

<b>			GINA
</b>		I told his father he'd be on that flight.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Well you could tell him otherwise.  It
		was good of you to be all this help.  But
		he doesn't want to go tonight.

<b>			GINA
</b>		Jesus, Sally.  I'm not the enemy.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		And you're not the wife.

<b>			GINA
</b>		It's not a contest.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Damn straight.

<b>			CAL
</b>		Should I go up?

<b>			SALLY
</b>		I don't think so.

<b>			CAL
</b>		You want us to stay?

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Maybe not.

<b>			MAC
</b>		So much for ecstacy, right?

	They all laugh a little.

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		Let's get the kids.

<b>			CLAIR
</b>		Oh my God, the sitter.

<b>			SALLY
</b>			(laughs)
		Oh Clair, you're so... You know.  You
		just put things in perspective.

<b>	INT. MUSIC LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	Joe listens to the answering machine message Lucy left that
	morning.  He plays it again and again.

	HE fast forwards to his father's voice.  Presses the STOP
	button.  Sits there, stunned.

<b>			JOE
</b>			(dials phone, a moment)
		Hey, Dad...

<b>	INT. GUEST BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	Cal and Sophia bundle up their sleeping kids.  The CAMERA
	follows them to the landing as they head downstairs, pass
	Sally who is coming up.

<b>			SOPHIA
</b>		I'm going to be home all weekend, call if
		you need anything.

	Sally kisses Cal's cheek.

<b>			CAL
</b>		Hang in.

<b>	INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	Panes and Skye are fucking on Joe and Sally's bed.  Sally
	walks in on them searching for Panes' ear, her best buddy.

<b>			SALLY
</b>			(resigned)
		Oh perfect!

<b>	EXT. BACKYARD LANDING - MEDIUM FULL SHOT
</b>
	Jerry and Judy lie alongside each other, hands propping
	heads.  They aren't privy to anything that's happened.

<b>			JERRY
</b>		I call that a perfect day.

<b>			JUDY
</b>		A perfect night.

<b>			JERRY
</b>		Damn near.
			(long moment)
		And a damn near perfect drug.

<b>			JUDY
</b>		Hm.  We should do it again.

<b>			JERRY
</b>		Just every once in a blue moon, you know.

<b>			JUDY
</b>		Hm.
			(a long moment)
		You think we should ask them for their
		landscaper?

<b>			JERRY
</b>		Hm.  Do you like fucking out of doors?

<b>			JUDY
</b>		Not as a rule.

<b>			JERRY
</b>			(a long moment)
		They didn't sign their goddamn tax
		returns!

<b>	EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	Sally stands at the threshold, watches Cal and Sophia load
	their kids into the car.

<b>	INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	Clair and Mac and Gina hug and say their goodbyes to Sally.

<b>			GINA
</b>			(kisses Sally; whispers)
		Take good care of it.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Count on it.

<b>	EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	Monica and Ryan return from their unsuccessful search.  They
	come through the gate with it's sight: KEEP GATE CLOSED.
	Monica and Ryan start for the kitchen entrance.

<b>	INT. KITCHEN - FROM MONICA AND RYAN'S POV
</b>
	Sally and Joe are alone in the room.  They hold each other,
	weep...

<b>			RYAN
</b>			(appalled)
		Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog!

<b>			MONICA
</b>			(regards them)
		Don't go in, Ryan.

<b>			RYAN
</b>		What?

<b>			MONICA
</b>		Let's just go home, okay?

<b>	INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	A much embarrassed Panes and Skye enter.

<b>			PANES
</b>		Coffee?

<b>			JOE
</b>		Sure.

<b>			PANES
</b>		I'll do it.

	Panes starts to make some; Skye starts to clean up glasses
	and ashtrays.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		You don't need to do that.

<b>			SKYE
</b>		I don't mind...

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Relax.  You've done enough.

<b>	EXT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	We see Judy and Jerry bounding around the side of the house.
	Jerry has his briefcase in his hand.  They are laughing.
	They enter the kitchen.  The camera stays outside.  We see
	them brought up short by the gloom, but hear nothing.

<b>	INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	Sally and Joe are at the table, signing their tax returns.
	Jerry supervising.  All is quiet.  Judy's sunk into a chair.

<b>	INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	Morning's finally come.  Light fills the room, empty except
	for party debris.

<b>	INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	It's empty but for glasses, wrapping paper, abandoned dishes
	of leftover cake.

<b>	INT. EMPTY KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
</b>
<b>	INT. GUEST BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	The bed is rumpled and indented from the sleeping children.
	Their drawings and paints strewn all over the floor...and
	Walls.

<b>	INT. EMPTY DEN - CONTINUOUS
</b>
<b>	INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	The bed still shows the remains of Panes and Skye's love
	making.

	The CAMERA moves through the suite into the bathroom.
	Sally's in the tub.  Joe comes into the room in the buff.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Can I come in?

	Sally looks up at the nakedness.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Sure.

	HE slips into the tub with her.  They lie there facing each
	other.

<b>			OE
</b>		My plane leaves in a few hours.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Okay.  Do you want me to come with you?

<b>			JOE
</b>			(simply)
		No.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Okay.

<b>			JOE
</b>			(a moment)
		Pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't
		it?

<b>			SALLY
</b>		I guess.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Life gets messy.  Ugly messy.  But I
		don't understand you.  And I don't think
		I ever understood Lucy.  I don't
		understand throwing it away.  How do you
		throw all that away?  Any of it.  I want
		it all.  You guys want guarantees?  I
		want the possibilities.  And all kinds of
		crap comes with that.  A lot of bad shit.
		And I think that's okay with me because,
		because of the rest of the stuff.  All
		the good shit.  All the surprises.  It's
		a fucking miracle when you come down to
		it.
			(a moment)
		We'd have had amazing children, you and
		me.  We'd have had a ride.  You'd have
		surprised yourself.
			(regards her)
		I'll never love anybody else, you know.

<b>			SALLY
</b>			(a little choked laugh)
		Me too.

<b>			JOE
</b>		That's under lock and key.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Me too.

	Joe reaches out of the tub for gift-wrapped box.  He hands it
	to sally.  It's their ritual gift-giving site.

	Sally opens the gift.  Takes out a Calder mobile.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Happy anniversary.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		It's a Calder.

<b>			JOE
</b>		I know.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		He's my favorite.

<b>			JOE
</b>		I know.  It's for the baby's crib.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Ah...

	She hands him a small wooden box.  He opens it, takes out a
	set of keys.

<b>			SALLY (CONT'D)
</b>		They're the keys to your grandad's flat.
		Happy anniversary, baby.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Oh, Sally Mae...

	He can't say anymore.

<b>			SALLY
</b>		I know.

<b>			JOE
</b>		Will you make love with me?

<b>			SALLY
</b>		Sure.

	She reaches out with both arms.

<b>	INT. BATHROOM - TIGHT CLOSE
</b>
	Joe and Sally tenderly make love.  It's the dissolution of
	their marriage.

<b>	INT. FOYER - NINE A.M.
</b>
	America and Rosa begins to clean up the debris from the
	party.

<b>	EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	A taxi pulls up.  Joe gets in with his bags.  The cab backs
	out...

<b>	INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MEDIUM CLOSE
</b>
	The two wedding rings rest on the nightstand, hers nestled in
	his.  Sally's hand opens the drawer, sweeps the rings into
	it.

<b>	EXT. HOUSE - LATE MORNING
</b>
	The "FOR SALE" sign is hammered into the ground.

<b>					DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>	EXT. HIGH SHOT - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	Otis wanders along the street, up the driveway and disappears
	through the flap in the kitchen door.

<b>						 FADE OUT.
