                                            by

                                     Edmund H. North

                                   Revised final draft

                                    February 21, 1951

<b>                
</b>
<b>               EXT. BEACH - PACIFIC ISLAND - MED. SHOT - DAY
</b>
               Backgrounded by palm trees and rolling surf, an American 
               army radar operator sits at his huge instrument, intently 
               tracking a target. Without interrupting this, he speaks with 
               tense excitement into a telephone transmitter strapped to 
               his chest. (It is 8:00 a.m.)

               (In this and the subsequent scenes, music and cutting build 
               to an exciting crescendo).

<b>               EXT. FIELD - HONG KONG - MED. SHOT - DAY
</b>
               A group of British soldiers, in shorts and tropical gear, 
               are gathered tensely around a piece of radar equipment, which 
               is tracking a target. The radar operator says something to 
               another soldier, who turns and speaks excitedly into a field 
               telephone. (It is 5:00 a.m.)

<b>               INT. INDIAN RADIO STATION - NIGHT
</b>
               The microphone bears the word CALCUTTA. An Indian announcer, 
               his expression one of excitement and terror, jabbers into 
               the mike in a native tongue. A clock on the wall indicates 
               that it is 2:26

<b>               EXT. RUSSIAN BOMBER IN FLIGHT - (STOCK) - NIGHT
</b>
               The plane is identified by a red star on the fuselage.

<b>               INT. RUSSIAN BOMBER - NIGHT
</b>
               The radioman is tracking an object on his radar scope. He 
               points it out excitedly to the pilot. The pilot adjusts his 
               microphone and starts making a report back to his base in 
               Russian.

<b>               EXT. FRENCH VILLAGE - STREET CORNER - MED. CLOSE SHOT - 
</b><b>               NIGHT
</b>
               A group of French farmers is collected around a radio, 
               listening wide-eyed to the keyed-up voice which is telling 
               them, in French, of a strange object that has been seen in 
               the sky. They exchange uneasy glances. One old man crosses 
               himself.

<b>               SPLIT SCREEN SHOT
</b>
<b>               RIGHT SECTION OF SCREEN SHOWS INT. AMERICAN RADIO STATION - 
</b><b>               DAY
</b>
               A breathless American radio reporter is speaking into his 
               mike, but we can't hear what he's saying. On the wall behind 
               him is a clock which reads 3:32.

<b>               LEFT SECTION OF SCREEN SHOWS INT. BRITISH RADIO STATION - 
</b><b>               NIGHT
</b>
               A clock shows the time to be 8:32. The British announcer 
               tries to maintain his traditional BBC calm, but finds it 
               almost impossible to control his excitement.

<b>                                     BRITISH ANNOUNCER
</b>                         Reports are coming in from all over 
                         the Empire -- from all over the world. 
                         The Government have not yet issued a 
                         statement, but there seems to be no 
                         question that there actually is a 
                         large, unidentified object circling 
                         the earth at incredible speed.

               This announcer keeps talking, but his voice fades out, and 
               now we hear the words the American announcer is saying...

<b>                                     AMERICAN ANNOUNCER
</b>                              (staccato with 
                              excitement)
                         We still don't know what it is or 
                         where it's from –- but we do know 
                         there's something there. It's been 
                         tracked around the world by radar 
                         traveling at a rate of four thousand 
                         miles an hour.

<b>               INT. NEW YORK TAXI - DRIVER AND FARE – DAY
</b>
               The driver and his fare are listening intently to the radio, 
               as we hear the voice of another radio reporter.

<b>                                     2ND RADIO REPORTER
</b>                              (voice off scene)
                         This is not another "flying saucer" 
                         scare. Scientists and military men 
                         have already agreed on that. Whatever 
                         this is -- it's something real.

<b>               EXT. SUBURBAN GAS STATION
</b>
               The attendant, who is filling a car with gas, leans around 
               to hear the car's radio, oblivious to the fact that the car's 
               tank is overflowing.

<b>                                     3RD RADIO REPORTER
</b>                              (voice off scene)
                         We interrupt this program to give 
                         you a bulletin just received from 
                         one of our naval units at sea. "A 
                         large object, traveling at supersonic 
                         speed, is headed over the North 
                         Atlantic toward the east coast of 
                         the United States."

               Music builds to a climax and ends.

<b>               INT. WASHINGTON RADIO STATION
</b>
<b>                                     4TH RADIO REPORTER
</b>                              (with deliberately 
                              controlled calm)
                         Here in the nation's capital, there 
                         is anxiety and concern, but no outward 
                         sign of panic. As a matter of fact, 
                         there are signs of normalcy that 
                         seem strangely out of place; the 
                         beautiful spring weather, the tourist 
                         crowds at the various monuments and 
                         public buildings...

<b>               EXT. LINCOLN MEMORIAL - LONG SHOT (STOCK)
</b>
               A small crowd of tourists is climbing the steps to the 
               columned entrance.

<b>               EXT. WASHINGTON MONUMENT - LONG SHOT (STOCK)
</b>
               Under this shot a barely audible, distant hum is heard. It 
               grows in volume so imperceptibly in this and the next two 
               shots that we are unconscious of it.

<b>               EXT. JEFFERSON MEMORIAL - LONG SHOT (STOCK)
</b>
<b>               EXT. THE MALL - LONG SHOT
</b>
               Crowds are strolling on the Mall and across the well-kept 
               lawns in front of the Smithsonian Institution with the 
               leisurely, meandering quality that distinguishes sight-seers.

<b>               MED. SHOT
</b>
               Including several small groups of people moving toward the 
               Smithsonian. Their attention is attracted as the hum off 
               scene becomes a roar. The sound is unearthly in its intensity 
               and almost unbearable in its swiftly increasing volume. The 
               people stop in their tracks and look up in the sky in terror.

<b>               MED. CLOSE SHOT
</b>
               Several people on the steps of the Smithsonian have turned 
               to look. There is cold, frozen fear in their eyes. The awful 
               sound keeps increasing in volume.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT
</b>
               A man, following the progress of a huge object in the sky 
               with his eyes. He is held terror-stricken.

<b>               LONG SHOT INTO SKY (SERSEN SHOT)
</b>
               A giant shape, still at some distance, is approaching the 
               earth at incredible speed.

<b>               LONG SHOT ON GROUND
</b>
               A group of people run wildly across a large expanse of lawn. 
               A huge shadow cast from above onto the grass seems to be 
               pursing them.

<b>               LONG SHOT INTO SKY (SERSEN SHOT)
</b>
               The great shape is considerably nearer now.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT
</b>
               Of a woman, thoroughly shaken, held immobile by what she 
               sees and hears.

<b>               LONG SHOT
</b>
               People scatter madly in all directions as the huge spaceship 
               comes in for a landing on a smooth, grassy area. The 
               tremendous roar of its motors is suddenly cut off and the 
               great ship settles gently to a perfect landing.

<b>               MED. SHOT - THE SHIP
</b>
               The gleaming surface of the ship shows no break of any kind -- 
               no windows, no ports, not even the outline of a hatch. It is 
               a fearsome, terrifying object, giving no evidence of its 
               source or its intention.

               Shooting down on a section of lawn, showing the varying 
               reactions of people to the landing. Some are still running 
               madly away; others, singly and in little groups, stand as 
               though rooted, staring at the ship from a respectful distance.

               As he stares at the ship with fascination and horror. He'd 
               like to run but he can't. His mouth twitches and he emits a

               A woman is holding a two-year-old child by the hand as she 
               watches the ship, awe-struck. Several people run past them. 
               Suddenly the woman grabs up the child with a little sob, 
               turns and runs away.

                         you that so far there is no reasonable 
                         cause for alarm. The rumors of 
                         invading armies and mass destruction 
                         are based on hysteria and are 
                         absolutely false. I repeat -- these

                         where it came from, but I can reveal 
                         that military leaders are considering

               We are at the actual location now, not looking at TV. We see 
               the ship surrounded by soldiers, two medium tanks, two 
               artillery pieces, and a couple of machine guns. Some distance 
               away is a suggestion of the crowd of civilians, held back by 
               police. Prominent in the scene are newsreel and television 
               cameras. OUR CAMERA MOVES IN to MED. SHOT. As it does so, we 
               see a couple of metal objects rising slowly from the top of 
               the ship. One, which is an oddly-designed coil of wire, slides 
               up and revolves slowly. The other is a section of vented 
               pipe with a convex cap on it.

               on the soldiers, their eyes glued to this first sign of 
               activity from the ship. They shift uneasily, gripping their 
               rifles more firmly.

<b>               MED. SHOT - THE SHIP
</b>
               After a long, tense moment, a ramp appears silently out of 
               the side of the ship and slides down to the ground. There is 
               an audible gasp as a man appears at the top of the ramp. He 
               looks around at the crowd with cool and imperturbable dignity. 
               This is KLAATU. He is completely human in appearance. The 
               only unearthly thing about him is his clothing. He wears a 
               tunic that is very good looking, but at the same time 
               thoroughly comfortable and practical. On his head is a metal 
               helmet that obscures most of his face. (It would be impossible 
               to identify him later.) The design of this helmet gives the 
               impression that it is more a formal headdress than for 
               protection. Klaatu is above all an impressive man -- a man 
               of tremendous dignity and presence. He has the tolerant 
               superiority that comes with absolute knowledge.

</b>
               After an impressive moment, he raises his arms in the 
               universal gesture of neutrality. Then he speaks, in perfect 
               English, his voice amplified as though through an enunciator.

                         and with good will.

               Klaatu walks slowly down the ramp toward the soldiers. As he 
               does so, he draws from inside his tunic a strange looking 
               object, longish and tubular. It might be a a telescope -- or 
               it might be some strange kind of weapon.

</b>
               shooting from the side, showing Klaatu advancing slowly toward 
               the line of soldiers. He holds out the mysterious object in 
               front of him in a gesture that is actually one of offering 
               but could be misinterpreted as menacing. There is a growing, 
               uneasy rumble of muttering among the soldiers as Klaatu 
               advances. They are clearly frightened of what he may do.

               Klaatu starts toward the platoon leader, raising the object 
               he holds toward the man, trying to make clear his intentions. 
               Misinterpreting this as a menacing gesture, the platoon leader 
               raises his carbine to his shoulder.

               of one of the tank commanders in the turret of his tank. He 
               is watching Klaatu advancing toward the platoon leader and 
               he has drawn his pistol. Convinced that the lieutenant is in 
               jeopardy, the tank commander aims at Klaatu and fires.

<b>               MED. SHOT

               as Klaatu falls to the ground wounded. The object he was 
               holding has dropped from his hand and smashed. The soldiers 
               start to gather around Klaatu excitedly when suddenly there 
               appears in the entrance to the space ship a huge robot. There 
               is a gasp of amazement from the crowd and the solders draw 
               back at sight of him. The robot is ten feet tall, is made in 
               the almost-perfect image of a man. He is to be played by an 
               actor and his flesh appears to be made of a greenish metal. 
               His eyes flash as though lighted internally. His perfectly-
               fashioned, muscular body is covered only with a loincloth. 
               This is GORT.

               There are cries of amazement as Gort walks slowly ponderously, 
               down the ramp to the ground. As he does so, the ramp closes 
               behind him. Gort's face is, and always remains, utterly 
               expressionless. He stops to look at Klaatu, lying on the 
               ground. Then he looks around at the soldiers, the tanks and 
               guns. All the guns have been traversing to follow him.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT - GORT
</b>
               From inside him there comes an ominous crackling sound, as 
               though power were being generated within him. His eyes flash 
               toward the tank from which Klaatu was shot.

<b>               MED. CLOSE SHOT - TANK
</b>
               There is a great metallic clatter and the Sherman tank is 
               suddenly reduced to a pile of junk metal, its parts completely 
               disintegrated. Only a piece of tank track and twisted gun 
               barrel emerge from the heap on the ground to identify what 
               had been there. The tank's crew has remained unharmed.

</b>
               The crackling sound continues as his eyes start to sweep in 
               a semicircle taking in all the troops.

               SHOOTING FROM BEHIND Gort, with the back of his head in f.g., 
               CAMERA PANS to follow Gort's sweeping gaze. In a growing 
               crash and clatter of metal, every weapon in sight is 
               destroyed. The two machine guns are little heaps of junk. 
               The 75's are larger heaps. The second tank, like the first, 
               is a three-foot pile of scrap. Rifles have dropped from the 
               soldier's hands and lie on the ground as little mounds of 
               wood and metal. None of the men has been harmed, but their 
               faces show the utter terror of what they have experienced.

               as they react to the full shock of what has happened. Most 
               of them stand rooted to the ground. Several laugh 
               hysterically. A few break and run wildly.

<b>               MED. SHOT - CROWD OF CIVILIANS
</b>
               Sudden pandemonium breaks out. Utterly terrified by what 
               they have witnessed, the crowd becomes a wild, milling, 
               screaming mob, concerned only with escape.

               He is walking slowly, deliberately, menacingly toward the 
               tank commander who fired on Klaatu. Standing by the debris 
               of his tank, the man is immobilized with terror. The robot 
               starts to reach out to grab him.

               lying on the ground. He speaks to Gort sharply, in a strange 
               language.

<b>               MED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT
</b>
               He pauses obediently in the act of reaching out for the tank 
               commander. Dropping his arms, he stands motionless and remains 
               that way.

</b>
               He has raised himself to a sitting position on the ground, 
               his wounded shoulder giving him considerable pain. The two 
               platoon leaders come into scene hesitantly, badly shaken by 
               the awesome demonstration of power they have seen. They are 
               uncertain as to what they should do. The platoon leader eyes 
               the smashed object on the ground curiously and turns 
               questioningly to Klaatu. With great dignity, Klaatu picks up 
               the broken object, which we see well for the first time. It 
               is a delicately-made tubular telescope, badly smashed. On it 
               are indications of small electronic gadgets.

                              (glances at the broken 
                              object ruefully)
                         With this he could have studied life 
                         on other planets.

               Klaatu lets the object drop with a shrug of mild exasperation. 
               The two lieutenants exchange a helpless look of bewilderment. 
               Then Klaatu raises himself to his feet painfully, holding 
               his wounded shoulder. As he does so, a colonel and a captain 
               come into scene.

               The three junior officers exchange ineffectual glances and 
               look to the colonel, who thinks for a moment before making 
               his decision.

</b>
               There is a door to the corridor and a door to Klaatu's room. 
               In the small sitting room, talking in tones of hushed concern, 
               is a group of men. There's a Major General, a likable man 
               with a chest full of ribbons. There are also a Colonel in 
               command of the hospital, a high-ranking police officer, a 
               couple of medical officers and two civilians. The conversation 
               is interrupted by the entrance from Klaatu's room of a Medical 
               Corps Major, followed by an Army Nurse.

</b>                         No, sir, he didn't.

               The door to the corridor opens and a worried young Captain 
               enters.

                         They're swarming all over the lobby.

               The Colonel turns, in deference, to the General.

                              corridor)
                         Mr. Harley's here from the White 
                         House.

               Harley appears in the doorway, a brief case under his arm. 
               He's a dignified, intelligent member of the White House 
               secretariat. He proceeds uninterruptedly into the room, 
               nodding cordially to the General.

                         Right in there, Mr. Harley.

               Harley proceeds in businesslike fashion to the door. He knocks 
               and then enters.

<b>               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - FULL SHOT
</b>
               as Harley enters, closing the door behind him. Klaatu no 
               longer wears his helmet and we see his face clearly for the 
               first time. Even sitting up in bed, with his shoulder strapped 
               in bandages, he is a figure of great authority. His face 
               reflects inner dignity and assurance. Harley, who is a 
               hardened diplomatist, can't help being impressed by his 
               present assignment and a little awed by Klaatu. Harley 
               obviously has been sent by the President to find out what he 
               can. Klaatu's eyes study him, cool, penetrating, reserved.

                         Sit down, Mr. Harley.

               Somewhat relieved, Harley seats himself. He speaks with a 
               half smile, hoping to ease the tension.

               Harley glances at him quickly to be sure he's not joking. 
               He's not.

               Harley reacts, as his wildest assumptions are so blandly 
               corroborated.

                         The first two years of television we

               Harley smiles. Then his mind reverts to the seriousness of 
               the situation and he speaks gravely.

                         produced the tension in our world.

                         How do we proceed, Mr. Harley?

               Harley is thoroughly shaken. The tremendous force and power 
               implicit in Klaatus's manner preclude the possibility of 
               argument.

                         table.

               Growing a little impatient with such nonsense, Klaatu eyes 
               him evenly, speaks with Jovian authority.

               The eyes of the two men meet for a long, silent moment. Then 
               Harley rises quietly.

               Searchlights have lighted up up the eerie shapes of the space 
               ship and Gort. A circle of soldiers guard the area, while a

               A Master Sergeant of Engineers, dressed in fatigues, is 
               inspecting the side of the ship carefully. He has an acetylene 
               torch in his had and a welding helmet over his face. The 
               Major General, previously seen in the hospital sitting room, 
               enters and speaks to the Sergeant.

               A man named Carlson, a civilian metallurgical expert, comes 
               into scene. The General nods to him.

                              and reads)
                         "The Premier wishes to inform the 
                         Government of the United States that

                              glance at Klaatu,

                              cable)
                         "The suggestion of the President 
                         regarding the possibility of a meeting 
                         in Moscow would be unacceptable to

                         be sent only if the meeting were

                         Well -- there you have it.

               Harley extends a sheaf of cables for Klaatu's inspection, 
               but he ignores them. Klaatu has listened to this recital, 
               first incredulously, then with mounting indignation. Conscious 
               of his quiet, Olympian wrath, Harley continues uncomfortably.

               Harley has paused near the door, a little embarrassed by

               With a polite nod, he goes out. Klaatu stares after him as 
               he realizes that he is in effect a prisoner. He shakes his 
               head slowly, thoughtfully. The ways of this planet are strange

               pauses as the M.P. takes out a key and inserts it in the

               CAMERA is on the back of a man dressed in a business suit, 
               who is walking along the sidewalk of a dimly lighted, almost 
               deserted, middle-class street. He carries a suitcase and he 
               glances idly at the drab-looking stone facades of the old 
               two-story houses. As he passes, from the open windows of the 
               houses come the voices of radio announcers. We get a sentence 
               or two from one house and then, as the man and our CAMERA 
               pass on, this voice fades and another is picked up. We get 
               the impression that everyone is glued to his radio.

               --these fantastic descriptions of the creature are denounced 
               as rumor by police Chief Walter Baxter. He is not eight feet 
               tall, as reported -- nor does he have tentacles in place of 
               arms--

               the "space man" in the past hour. One from Des Moines, Iowa;

               CAMERA OVERTAKES the man as he pauses under the light of a 
               street lamp, and reveals that it is Klaatu. He has stopped

               He seems to hesitate, debating a plan he has in mind. He 
               raises his right arm to scratch his head thoughtfully, and 
               notices for the first time a small tag, or ticket, attached 
               to the inside of the right forearm of the coat he is wearing. 
               Puzzled, he pulls off the ticket and looks at it.

               It is the sort of tag a cleaning establishment attaches to

               from the screen. The room is done in average boardinghouse

               is satisfied that she's established a cozy atmosphere.

</b>
               Five of the boarders -- Mr. and Mrs. Barley, Mr. Krull, Helen 
               Benson and Klaatu - are finishing their Sunday morning 
               breakfast. Mrs. Barley is a middle-class Helen Hokinson lady, 
               form and unrelenting. Her husband is a born complainer. Mr. 
               Krull is a shriveled little accountant, precise and finicky. 
               As they finish their coffee, all except Helen are immersed 
               in the Sunday papers. Helen seems preoccupied with her own 
               thoughts. From a portable radio on the table comes Gabriel 
               Heater's voice.

<b>                                     GABRIEL HEATER'S VOICE
</b>                         --and so, this Sunday morning, we 
                         ask the question that's been plaguing; 
                         the entire nation for two days now: 
                         "Where is this creature and what is 
                         he up to?" If he can build a space 
                         ship that can fly to Earth -- and a 
                         robot that can destroy our tanks and 
                         guns -- what other terrors can he 
                         unleash at will? ...Obviously we 
                         must find this monster. We must track 
                         him down like a wild animal and 
                         destroy him.

<b>               INSERT - NEWSPAPER PAGE IN MRS. BARLEY'S HANDS
</b>
               It is a full page layout, in the style of the American Weekly, 
               showing a demented artist's conception of a mass invasion of 
               space ships. Weird-looking creatures are slaughtering Earth 
               people with ray guns. The caption at the top of the image 
               reads: "Are We Long For This World?" (Gabriel Heater's voice 
               continues uninterruptedly over this and the next two scenes.)

               He is reading his paper with considerable interest.

<b>               INSERT - NEWSPAPER STORY
</b>
               The third-page story reads: SAVANT CALLS MEETING TO STUDY 
               SPACE SHIP. Professor Jacob Barnhardt, world-famous scientist 
               and Nobel Prize winner, has invited fellow scientists from 
               all over the world to meet with him in Washington and study 
               the recently landed "Space Ship."

<b>               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU
</b>
               His face is thoughtful as he finishes reading. This story 
               seems to impress and interest him. Then suddenly he finds 
               his attention caught at what the Radio Voice is saying.

<b>                                     GABRIEL HEATER'S VOICE
</b>                         But where would such a creature hide 
                         himself? Would he disappear into the 
                         north woods? Or would he slither off 
                         into the sewers of some great city?

               Klaatu has a reaction of affronted dignity at this monstrously 
               distasteful idea.

                         can we do to protect ourselves? What 
                         measures can we take that will--

               During the above, Mrs. Barley has turned to her husband in 
               sharp annoyance.

               Helen is debating the matter in her mind, concerned about 
               leaving Bobby with a comparative stranger, but tempted because 
               of her favorable impression of Klaatu.

               as they move on away from the excited crowd of people. 
               Klaatu's reaction has been one of mild curiosity. Bobby looks 
               up at him.

                         I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to 
                         doubt it.

                              walking)
                         Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity 
                         mean?

                         Velocity is the time rate of change 
                         of position.

               This explanation misses Bobby by several light years. He 
               glances up at Klaatu blankly.

               Pulled out of his reverie, Klaatu glances down at Bobby and 
               smiles apologetically. Bobby grins back at him. Then, as 
               they walk on a few more steps, Klaatu stops and speaks 
               thoughtfully.

<b>               EXT. BARNHARDT'S HOUSE - MED. SHOT - DAY
</b>
               The house is an unimposing old-fashioned structure, shouldered 
               on either side by similar one-family dwellings. There is a 
               flight of stone steps leading up to the entrance and a large 
               porch across the front of the house. Klaatu and Bobby walk 
               into scene and pause, Klaatu glances at Bobby and Bobby nods 
               toward the house. They move on up the steps to the entrance.

<b>               MED. CHOOSE SHOT - AT FRONT DOOR
</b>
               Bobby, all eagerness and excitement, presses the bell. They 
               wait a moment and there is no answer.

</b>                              (disappointed at the

                         Gee -- maybe he isn't home.

               Bobby wanders down the porch and looks into a window. 
               Fascinated by what he sees, he gestures to Klaatu.

</b>                         Betcha this is where he works--

               After a glance at the front door, Klaatu joins Bobby at the 
               window and looks in.

<b>               FULL SHOT - BARNHARDT'S STUDY
</b>
               SHOOTING through the window, over the heads of Klaatu and 
               Bobby. The room is more of a workroom than a study. It is in 
               comfortably shabby disarray, with papers and books everywhere. 
               There's a battered old desk and a day bed. One wall is solid 
               bookshelves and on the other two are blackboards covered 
               with a fantastic array of complex equations, graphs and 
               diagrams.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU
</b>
               His attention has been caught by one of the blackboards and 
               he studies it with great interest and curiosity.

<b>               MED. CLOSE SHOT - SECTION OF BLACKBOARD
</b>
               It is covered with a particularly complicated series of 
               equations in a chalky scrawl, involving angles of vector, 
               Keplerian ellipses, etc. The final equations are unsolved; 
               they have no answers after the "equals" sign. Across are 
               little printed signs tacked to the blackboard reading: "Don't 
               erase!" and "Don't touch!"

<b>               TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND BOBBY
</b>
               Bewildered, Bobby looks from the blackboard up at Klaatu. 
               Still studying the blackboard, Klaatu is shaking his head 
               and clucking his tonsure as one might at the attempts of a 
               child to solve a problem in arithmetic.

                              equations)
                         What does that mean?

<b>                                     KLAATU
</b>                         It's a problem in celestial mechanics.

<b>                                     BOBBY
</b>                         Bet he's the only one in the world 
                         knows the answer.

<b>                                     KLAATU
</b>                              (he shakes his head, 
                              smiling)
                         He doesn't know the answer. And he'll 
                         never get it that way.

               Bobby moves over to a pair of French doors beyond the window 
               and tries to peer in through the curtained doors. He absently 
               tries the doors and finds them locked. Then he turns away 
               with a disappointed but philosophical shrug.

</b>                         We probably couldn't get to see him 
                         even if he was home.

               As Bobby moves away from the doors dejectedly, Klaatu puts 
               his hand on the knob.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY

               He's watching Klaatu and his eyes widen at what he sees.

<b>               CHOOSE SHOT - KLAATU
</b>
               He has opened the door and is standing in the doorway, his 
               hand, still on the knob. He is smiling at Bobby with secret 
               amusement. He's got an idea.

                         we ought to leave a calling card.

               Klaatu disappears into the study. Amazed, Bobby follows.

</b>
               Bobby watches as Klaatu walks to the blackboard and picks up 
               a piece of chalk. As though correcting a schoolboy's work, 
               he makes large check marks at several points in each equation.

<b>               EXT. PORCH - BARNHARDT'S HOUSE
</b>
               An efficient-looking middle-aged woman is mounting the steps 
               to the entrance, getting her front door key out of her purse, 
               when her eye falls on the French doors, which are standing 
               ajar. Puzzled, she starts down the porch toward the doors. 
               This woman is Barnhardt's secretary and her name is HILDA.

               Bobby is watching as Klaatu writes across the blackboard in 
               a bold hand: Differentiate the equation ( ).

               Klaatu underlines this comment with a sharp stroke, when a 
               stern voice is heard off screen.

                         Do you realize the Professor has

                         I think you'd better leave now. 
                         Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk 
                         and scribbles something on a scratch 
                         pad. He tears off the piece of paper 
                         and hands it to Hilda.

                         I think the professor will want to 
                         get in touch with me.

               With a polite nod he goes out the French doors, followed by 
               Bobby. Hilda eyes the door for a moment, then glances down 
               at the paper in her hand, disturbed and puzzled by this 
               stranger. Her glance wanders to the blackboard and she picks 
               up an eraser, debating whether to erase Klaatu's corrections. 
               At that moment the French door opens and Klaatu sticks his 
               head in. Startled, Hilda drops the eraser.

                         I wouldn't erase that. The Professor 
                         needs it very badly.

               And he disappears, leaving Hilda to glare after him in 
               impotent rage. Deciding that this man is either a crackpot 
               or a menace, she goes to the telephone on the desk and starts 
               dialing a number.

               move on up the sidewalk, revealing two kids playing hopscotch.

               Bobby and Klaatu come out of a wooded path into a section of 
               the cemetery where the myriad crosses seem to reach into 
               infinity. They pause for a moment, then Bobby leads the way

               Klaatu's glance roves out thoughtfully to the infinite rows 
               of crosses, and his eyes are sad as they return to Bobby.

               His eyes are drawn subconsciously out to the rows of crosses. 
               Then he turns back to Klaatu with a slow-dawning look of 
               curiosity, and Klaatu deliberately changes the subject.

               The boy studies Klaatu's face to see if he's kidding. 
               Realizing that he's not, Bobby's face takes on a childishly 
               shrewd expression -- as though he were about to trade a 
               jackknife for an ocean liner.

               The boy takes out two dollar bills and offers them almost 
               challengingly. Klaatu takes the bills and hands Bobby two 
               good-sized Diamonds. They study their new acquisitions with 
               interest. Bobby looks up from his diamonds to steal a guilty

               stops in front of the boardinghouse. A Detective in 
               plainclothes gets out and gestures to the uniformed Driver 
               to pull up the street a way and wait. The Driver nods and

               Klaatu and the Detective nod to Helen and they go out. Helen 
               watches the door close with real concern, wondering why the 
               police want Klaatu and hoping he hasn't done anything wrong. 
               Still disturbed, she turns to lead Bobby upstairs.

               satisfy Helen. He is climbing the stairs beside her.

               The place is crowded and there is a feeling of feverish but 
               well-ordered activity. Unidentified people who have been 
               picked up in the search for the space man are being screened 
               by the police. They are all men -- all between forty and 
               sixty years old -- and they are from all walks of life. A 
               series of desks have been arranged in a row, with signs over 
               them reading IDENTIFICATION. At each desk is a team of cops 
               and before each desk is a line of men waiting to be screened. 
               At the far end of the room Klaatu can be seen at the desk of 
               a Police Lieutenant, with the detective who picked him up.

               Shooting over the shoulders of two cops at one of the desks, 
               toward the line of people they are screening. A nondescript, 
               middle-aged vagrant stands before the desk as one of the 
               cops flips through a card file.

               The man is taken out of the line as CAMERA MOVES ON to the 
               next desk, with another pair of cops and another line. A 
               rather distinguished-looking business man is placing a sheaf 
               of identification cards and papers on the desk.

               CAMERA MOVES ON to a third desk where a small, rat-faced man 
               is standing uneasily before the two cops, one of whom is 
               flipping through a card file.

               A Detective Lieutenant in plain clothes is questioning Klaatu, 
               who stands beside the Detective who brought him in. The 
               Lieutenant is a rugged but dignified man about fifty, 
               intelligent and businesslike.

               The Detective takes Klaatu's arm and leads him toward the 
               door. As they go they pass a Military Police Captain, who 
               makes his way straight to the Lieutenant's desk.

               as they come out of the station. Klaatu hesitates a moment, 
               looks around. His face reveals nothing, but he seems to be 
               momentarily considering the idea of making a break. The 
               Detective, sensitive to such a possibility, hooks his arm 
               under Klaatu's and nods his head toward the sidewalk in silent 
               command. Klaatu allows himself to be led off.

               as the Detective leads Klaatu across the sidewalk to the

               is an Army staff car.

               speaks with a polite smile, a smile that might be one of 
               mild triumph.

               as the M.P. Captain and Klaatu enter the front door, which 
               is held open for then by Hilda. She gestures them toward the 
               half-open door of Barnhardt's study, where Barnhardt can be 
               seen puzzling over the problem on the blackboard. The Captain 
               knocks on the open door to attract his attention and enters 
               with Klaatu.

               continues to study Klaatu for a moment, then points to the 
               notations he made on the blackboard. There is a controlled 
               but anxious excitement in Barnhardt's attitude.

               Klaatu glances at the work Barnhardt has been doing on the 
               board. Then he points to one of the expressions in an 
               equation.

                         --at this point.

               Impressed and interested, Barnhardt tugs at his chin as he 
               studies and weighs the results.

                         order terms. But what about the effect

                         Hospital. Room 309. My doctor's name 
                         was Major White -- and I had a very 
                         attractive nurse called Ruth, who's 
                         getting married next Wednesday.

                         time.

               Barnhardt hesitates for a long, thoughtful moment. Then he 
               goes to the door, opens it and speaks to the Captain outside.

               him with a faint smile. Barnhardt sinks into a chair, trying 
               to adjust his mind.

</b>                         I came here to warn you that, by 
                         threatening danger, your planet faces 
                         danger -- very grave danger. I am 
                         prepared, however, to offer a 
                         solution.

</b>                         Would you care to be more specific?

<b>                                     KLAATU
</b>                              (evenly)
                         What I have to say must be said to 
                         all concerned.
                              (with a suggestion of 
                              deference to Barnhardt)
                         It is too important to be entrusted 
                         to any individual.

               Barnhardt is forced reluctantly to accept Klaatu's refusal 
               to go any further. After a moment's thought, he speaks 
               seriously, but with a twinkle in his eye.

</b>                         I gather that your efforts on the 
                         official level were not entirely 
                         successful.

                              unpleasant episode 
                              is recalled)
                         I come to you as a last resort -- 
                         and I confess that my patience is 
                         wearing thin.
                              (with Jovian annoyance)
                         Must I take drastic action in order 
                         to get a hearing?

</b>                              (uneasily)
                         What -- what sort of action do you 
                         mean?

<b>                                     KLAATU
</b>                         Violent action -- since that seems 
                         to be the only thing you people 
                         understand.
                              (quietly)
                         Leveling the island of Manhattan, 
                         perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of 
                         Gibraltar into the sea.

               Barnhardt stands staring at him for a moment, passes his 
               hand across his brow. Then, as Klaatu watches, Barnhardt 
               paces the floor, trying to digest what he has heard. After a 
               moment, he turns to Klaatu.

</b>                         Would you be willing to meet with 
                         the group of scientists I am calling 
                         together?. Perhaps you could explain 
                         your mission to them, and they in 
                         turn could present it to their various 
                         peoples.

                         That's what I came to see you about.

               Barnhardt flings him a glance, then looks momentarily 
               sheepish. But his own eagerness carries him on. He paces the 
               floor thoughtfully.

</b>                         It is not enough to have men of 
                         science. We scientists are too easily 
                         ignored -- or misunderstood. We must 
                         get important men from every field. 
                         Educators -- philosophers -- church 
                         leaders -- men of vision and 
                         imagination -- the finest minds in

</b>                         No -- not at all.

                         earthy character living in a 
                         respectable boarding house.

                              concerned)
                         I'm afraid I can't offer you any 
                         real protection. I have no influence 
                         in cases of inter-planetary

                              thoughtfully)
                         One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this 
                         group should reject your proposals. 
                         What is the alternative?

                              inescapable power)
                         I'm afraid you have no alternative. 
                         In such, a case the planet Earth 
                         would have to be--
                              (he looks for the 
                              right word)
                         --eliminated.

               The implications of this statement leave Barnhardt speechless, 
               his keen mind reeling.

</b>                         I assure you such power exists.

               Barnhardt stands silent for a moment, trying to collect his 
               shattered thoughts. Klaatu watches him as he starts pacing 
               again.

                         must be made to realize this. They 
                         must understand what is at stake.
                              (after a thoughtful 
                              moment, he looks up)
                         You mentioned a demonstration of 
                         force--

</b>                         Would such, a demonstration be 
                         possible before the meeting?

</b>                         Something that would dramatize for 
                         them and for their people the 
                         seriousness of the situation. 
                         Something that would affect the entire 
                         planet.

                         That can easily be arranged.

                         I wouldn't want you to harm anybody --

                         think of something.

                              smile)
                         Maybe a little demonstration.

</b>                              (thinking about it)
                         Something dramatic -- but not 
                         destructive.
                              (intellectually amused)
                         It's quite an interesting problem.
                              (Barnhardt nods vaguely)
                         Would day after tomorrow be all right? 
                         Say about noon?

               Klaatu's bland manner leaves Barnhardt shaken, almost wishing 
               he'd never started this business.

<b>               INT. LIVING ROOM - BOARDINGHOUSE - NIGHT

               It is about 3:30 the following evening. Helen is sitting in 
               a chair leafing through a magazine. She is dressed to go 
               out. A corner of the dining room can be seen, where Mr. and 
               Mrs. Barley are playing cards with Mr. Krull. Mrs. Crockett, 
               the landlady, enters from the hall on her way to the dining 
               room and notices Helen.

                         up.

                         Personally, I won't go out after 
                         dark these days.
                              (with an attempt at 
                              slyness)
                         But then -- I'm not courting, am I?

               She turns to go on into the dining room and as she does so 
               almost bumps into Klaatu who is coming out, having been 
               kibitzing the card game.

                         Oh -- Mr. Carpenter--!

               Klaatu steps aside as she hurries nervously into the dining 
               room. He turns, puzzled, to find Helen watching with a slight 
               smile.

                              (he shakes his hands 
                              to indicate 
                              nervousness)

               Helen watches him, a little uneasy in his presence. She is 
               fond of him, and she can't help being curious and concerned 
               about his brush with the police.

                         I've made since I've been here.

               Helen is deeply moved by Klaatu's affection for the boy, She 
               tried to dismiss her curiosity about him, but she can't. She 
               decides to face it.

                         Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a 
                         few questions. Bobby and I tried to 
                         see Professor Barnhardt in the 
                         afternoon, but he wasn't in. 
                         Apparently they thought I was looking 
                         for secrets of some kind.

               Helen has reacted in puzzlement at this second mention of 
               Barnhardt. They are interrupted by the ringing of the 
               doorbell. Helen goes to answer it.

               as Helen opens the front door to admit Tom. He appears 
               impatient, anxious to get going.

                         I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm 
                         intruding.

               Helen tries to shush him, to indicate Klaatu is in the next 
               room, when Klaatu appears in the doorway. He must have heard 
               Tom's remark, and there is an awkward moment. Klaatu is 
               completely unperturbed, but Helen is embarrassed.

               He goes on up the stairs. Helen steers Tom toward the living 
               room.

                         I'm sorry. I guess I'm just tired of 
                         hearing about Mr. Carpenter.

                         I don't like the way he's attached 
                         himself to you and Bobby. After all, 
                         what do you know about him?

               This touches on Helen's own private doubts, and she cannot 
               answer.

               She turns quickly and goes into the hall and hurries up the 
               stairs. Tom looks after her, dismissing the matter with a 
               shake of the head and a philosophical sigh. Of such stuff 
               are women made.

               Helen reaches the top of the stairs, crosses to her room and 
               grabs a coat off the bed. She's putting it on as she moves 
               down the hall to Bobby's room, the door of which is open.

               Bobby is at a table doing his homework and Klaatu has just

                         I'll say goodnight again.

               Helen is embarrassed. She would like to apologize for the 
               awkwardness downstairs but she doesn't quite know how to go 
               about it.

               He turns and goes out, closing the door. A little distracted, 
               Helen turns to Bobby.

               Helen watches as he starts to put away his work. She wants 
               to tell him something, but finds it difficult to say.

               Helen is surprised to get this corroboration for Klaatu's 
               story. Sensing his mother's uneasiness, the boy looks for 
               something intriguing -- some deep, dark secret.

               Not wanting to go into this any further, Helen blows him a 
               kiss and backs out, closing the door. Bobby stands thinking 
               for a moment, his mind still speculating on all sorts of 
               wonderful possibilities. Still preoccupied, he drifts over 
               to his bed and sits down to take of his shoes. He drops the 
               first one to the floor and is starting on the other, when 
               there is a light rap on his door. The door opens and Klaatu

               Klaatu goes out, closing the door behind him. Bobby hesitates 
               a moment, puzzled and curious. Then he goes over to the door, 
               flips off the lights, and slowly, noiselessly opens the door

               in and flips off the lights and closes the door. He then 
               scans the hall in both directions. Satisfied he isn't seen, 
               he moves surreptitiously down the hall toward the stairs,

               What does he want the flashlight for and where is he going? 
               Bobby decides he's got to find out. Hurriedly he laces on

               shooting over Klaatu's shoulder. As he watches, a Jeep filled 
               with armed soldiers -- apparently regular patrol -- drives 
               up to the entrance of the building. They stop for a moment 
               while their Sergeant checks with the guards. Assured that 
               everything is under control, the Sergeant signals his driver 
               and the Jeep moves off.

               Scanning the side of the building, he sees what he's looking 
               for. Waiting until the Jeep disappears, he starts toward one 
               side of the building, keeping himself concealed in the 
               foliage.

</b>
               as Klaatu maneuvers around the side of the building, where 
               there is a window. It has no glass in it but is heavily 
               barred.

               as he leaves the concealing foliage and crosses the clear, 
               grassy area surrounding the building. He stops and tries to 
               see through the window.

</b>
               shooting through the barred window into the building. The 
               huge robot looms large and eerie in the shadows cast by a 
               couple of naked work-lights. His head is angled, away from 
               the window.

</b>
               as Klaatu approaches the window. Aiming his flashlight at 
               Gort, he flashes the light intermittently, as though 
               signaling. (This should not approximate any known code.)

               As we watch, the intermittent flashes of Klaatu's light appear 
               on the wall ahead of Gort. Slowly, evenly, the robot's head 
               turns to face the window.

               from Gort's viewpoint, of the window, with Klaatu's light

               shooting on his back, as he finishes signaling and cuts off 
               the flashlight. He turns ant starts back for the concealment 
               of the foliage.

               craning his neck to look for Klaatu, who has eluded his view. 
               Suddenly he sees Klaatu again.

</b>
               making his way behind the foliage toward the front of the 
               building. Arriving at a point opposite the entrance, Klaatu 
               waits and watches.

               The two guards are standing in the doorway in positions of 
               relaxed alertness. Suddenly, inside the building behind them, 
               the giant figure of Gort looms silently in the doorway. His 
               two great arms reach out, grab the two guards and drag then 
               back inside the building.

</b>
               He lets out an inaudible gasp as he sees this. Bug-eyed, he 
               glances quickly to the point where he last saw Klaatu. He is 
               amazed at what he sees.

</b>
               from Bobby's viewpoint. Klaatu has emerged from the 
               concealment of the tree-lined path and is making his way 
               calmly toward the entrance of the building.

</b>
               As he watches Klaatu enter the building, his curiosity 
               conquers his fear and he starts tremblingly toward the 
               structure.

</b>
               as Klaatu enters. The huge shapes of the space ship and Gort 
               loom large and eerie. Klaatu starts across the barren 
               enclosure toward the ship.

               as Bobby approaches the door, fearful but fascinated. He

</b>
               In *f.g., near the door, the two guards lie unconscious. As 
               Klaatu walks toward the ship Gort slowly turns his head to 
               follow him with him with eyes. Klaatu touches a point on the 
               unbroken surface of the ship and the ramp silently swings 
               out and down to the ground. Klaatu mounts the ramp and 
               disappears inside the ship, whereupon the ramp silently 
               closes.

</b>
               as he watches this; his eyes bulging. He can scarcely believe 
               what he has seen. Suddenly a wave of sheer terror sweeps 
               over him. Scrambling to his feet, he turns and runs wildly 
               away.

</b>
               CAMERA FOLLOWS Klaatu as he moves down the tiny, dimly lighted 
               entrance corridor. He steps into the main cabin of the ship 
               and flips a switch which bathes the cabin in a diffused, 
               shadowless light. The walls are lined with a complex of 
               mysterious gadgetry -- knobs, dials, indicators, etc. All of 
               this should be as imaginative and unorthodox as possible, 
               while still retaining a feeling of sound but highly advanced 
               engineering.

               as Klaatu moves to the communications panel, flipping switches 
               and turning dials. Indicators light up. There are crackling, 
               whirring and buzzing sounds. Klaatu starts speaking into a 
               built-in microphone in his own strange language. He speaks 
               in rapid-fire explanation, continuing to talk, as we--

               as one of them slowly regains consciousness. Looking around, 
               he sees the great figure of Gort and is terror-stricken. He 
               shakes his companion frantically in an effort to bring him

               Bobby is curled up in a chair waiting for his mother to come 
               home. He's sleepy, but the excitement of what he has seen 
               precluded any such possibility. From the hall we hear the 
               front door opening as Helen and Tom come in.

               corridor door opens and Helen enters, tense and nervous.

               in her arms. He looks up at her with a feeble smile. Then 
               his face takes on an expression of urgency.

                         Get that message to Gort. Right away--

               Klaatu is unable to say any more. He is dead. Helen looks 
               around wildly, helplessly, with tears and terror in her eyes.

               as the soldiers pile out of their vehicles and close in on 
               the place where Klaatu lies. He is their first and all-
               important concern, and Helen finds herself pushed out of the 
               way, toward the edge of the growing crowd of soldiers.

               Shocked and, staggered by what's happened, she realizes she 
               must get to Gort. Taking advantage of the milling confusion 
               in the dark, she edges toward the pedestrian underpass until 
               she can slip into its entrance without being noticed. And 
               she disappears.

<b>               INT. BUILDING ENCLOSING SPACE SHIP - MED. SHOT - GORT - 
</b><b>               NIGHT
</b>
               In the eerie light of the huge building, the great robot 
               stands encased in a solid block of clear, transparent plastic. 
               As CAMERA MOVES IN slowly, we hear a low whirring sound, as 
               of power being generated. A faint glow, visible through the 
               plastic, emanates from Gort's body. His eyes, which seem to 
               express rage, shifts as though he were straining to break 
               out. As the whirring sound and the glow of Gort's body 
               increase in intensity, the sharp edges at the top of the ice-
               like block melt into roundness and the plastic starts to 
               drip away. (About 150 folding chairs are arranged on the 
               floor near the space ship for the meeting tonight.)

<b>               EXT. BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT - TWO SOLDIERS
</b>
               The whirring sound can be heard faintly from inside. The two 
               soldiers standing guard at the door hear the sound and listen 
               apprehensively. The two men exchange an uneasy glance. After 
               hesitating a moment, one of them decides to investigate. He 
               turns and goes inside the door.

<b>               INT. BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE SOLDIER
</b>
               As he stops and looks up at the robot, his eyes go wide with 
               terror.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT - GORT
</b>
               Gort is an awesome and terrifying sight. His head is free 
               now and he seems to be straining against the plastic, which 
               is dripping down the sides of the block.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT - SOLDIER
</b>
               He glances around nervously to see that his companion has 
               entered the building and is staring up at the robot, bug-
               eyed. Slowly the second soldier moves up beside the first. 
               Wordlessly, they bring their rifles up to the ready and click 
               them off safety. In spite of their terror, they advance slowly 
               toward the robot.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT - GORT
</b>
               The whirring sound is ominous and his body glows brightly. 
               And his eyes are fixed on the two advancing figures.

               as they move toward Gort.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT - GORT
</b>
               From inside him comes a new and terribly sharp crackling. 
               sound. And from his eyes two pencils of light dart out. After 
               a moment the crackling sound stops and the light goes off.

               from same angle as scene before last. But the two soldiers 
               have utterly disappeared.

               as Gort resumes breaking out of the plastic. There is no 
               sign of the two soldiers.

<b>               EXT. MALL - MED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN - NIGHT
</b>
               Hurrying along a footpath, nervous and distraught, she pauses 
               for a moment, looking at the entrance of the building. Then 
               she starts determinedly across the grass toward the entrance.

<b>               MED. SHOT
</b>
               PANNING with Helen as she approaches the entrance fearfully. 
               Rallying all her courage and determination, she forces herself 
               to step inside.

<b>               INT. BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN
</b>
               as she enters the huge, weirdly lighted building. She stops 
               short as her glance falls on the awesome figure of Gort. 
               Loneliness and terror grip her and she wants to run -- but 
               she realizes she can't.

<b>               MED. CLOSE SHOT -GORT
</b>
               He has seen Helen and his flashing eyes bore into her. His 
               upper body and arms are free now, and the plastic is rapidly 
               melting away.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT - HELEN
</b>
               She is held fascinated by the robot's staring eyes. For 
               another moment it looks as if she would, break and run. But 
               she summons all her courage, and moves slowly toward Gort, 
               whose legs are still held captive.

<b>               MED. SHOT - HELEN AND GORT
</b>
               as she moves slowly, fearfully toward him.

<b>               MED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT
</b>
               The plastic is dripping off his legs now. With great effort, 
               he pulls his legs free and steps out of the stuff. A huge 
               figure in the heavy shadows, he moves slowly and menacingly 
               toward Helen.

<b>               MED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN
</b>
               as she stops advancing, rooted to the spot in fear. Then she 
               starts backing away, keeping her eyes on him.

<b>               MED. SHOT - HELEN AND GORT
</b>
               As the great, hulking figure approaches, Helen can't stand 
               her ground. She turns and runs wildly toward the far end of 
               the building. Gort follows her with unhurried, inescapable 
               strides. Unwittingly, Helen has run into a corner, and the 
               robot is closing in on her.

<b>               MED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN
</b>
               Her eyes go wide with terror as she realizes she's trapped. 
               In a wild effort to run around him, she stumbles and falls 
               to the floor. Immobilized with fright, she lies breathless, 
               looking up at him. Then she gives a piercing scream.

<b>               TWO SHOT - HELEN AND GORT
</b>
               as the great robot bends over her menacingly, arms 
               outstretched as though to grab or smash her.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT - HELEN
</b>
               All hope gone, she is blessed with a moment of lucidity, and 
               she remembers the message Klaatu told her to deliver.

<b>                                     HELEN

<b>               CLOSE SHOT - GORT
</b>
               He pauses as he hears the words. His face doesn't change 
               expression, but the words obviously have an effect on him. 
               He hesitates thoughtfully for a moment.

<b>               TWO SHOT - HELEN AND GORT
</b>
               Helen watches him in an agony of suspense. Then the robot 
               slowly bends down, picks her up in his arms and starts walking 
               toward the space ship.

<b>               MED. SHOT
</b>
               PANNING with Gort as he carries Helen, speechless with fright, 
               to the side of the ship. He touches the side, and the ramp 
               moves slightly out. He mounts the ramp, still carrying Helen, 
               and disappears into the ship with her. And the ramp closes 
               silently behind them.

<b>               INT. SMALL CORRIDOR - SPACE SHIP
</b>
               CAMERA FOLLOWS as Gort carries Helen through the dimly lighted 
               corridor into the main cabin, where he flips a switch that 
               lights up the cabin. The robot proceeds to a small door 
               leading off the main cabin and disappears with Helen inside 
               it.

<b>               INT. SMALL CABIN - FULL SHOT
</b>
               This is revealed as a weirdly equipped laboratory, the walls 
               of which are lined with the most complex array of mechanical 
               and electronic apparatus. Gort sets Helen down on a stool 
               and indicates for her to stay there. Too terrified to move, 
               Helen watches as he busies himself with the apparatus. He 
               starts flipping switches and turning dials. As a result, 
               lights begin to flash and there's a strange series of 
               mechanical noises.

</b>
               Unable to guess the reason for these preparations, she is 
               gripped with a terrible fear.

<b>               FULL SHOT
</b>
               Ignoring Helen completely, Gort finishes his work. Then he 
               moves to the door and goes out, closing the door behind him. 
               Helen rushes to the door and searches frantically for the 
               knob -- only to find, to her terror, that there is none. 
               Frenziedly she beats on the solid metal door.

               as the ramp comes down and Gort steps out. With grim, 
               determined strides he starts toward the entrance of the 
               building as the ramp silently closes.

               A squad of armed soldiers, led by the lieutenant, is admitted

               down the corridor toward a cell at the far end.

<b>               INT. CELL - POLICE STATION

               This is a cell on the ground floor. In the far wall is a 
               heavily barred window, beyond which is as alley. In f.g. are 
               Klaatu's feet, stretched out on a crude table. As CAMERA 
               HOLDS, the huge figure of Gort appears outside the barred 
               window, Seeing Klaatu, he reaches up and yanks out the steel 
               bars as though they were chicken wire. With a crushing blow 
               of his knee he crumbles the brick and mortar below the window 
               and steps inside the cell. He moves without interruption 
               toward the body of Klaatu.

                         That no one can say.

               Klaatu moves one of the sliding panels and reaches for a 
               suit of his "other world" clothing from behind the panel. 
               With a nod of apology, he steps behind the panel to change.

               Helen is genuinely upset at the thought of his leaving and 
               the knowledge that he is to die. There is a compelling warmth 
               of feeling between these two.

                         mistake before you make it.

               Klaatu looks at her in warm, considered admiration. Then he 
               moves to one side of the cabin and flips a switch. Suddenly 
               an entire section of the side wall is made transparent. 
               Through it, as through a screen, we can see out into the 
               building. Most of the chairs are already occupied, and 
               latecomers are still moving in through the door. Facing the 
               group, on a little dais, is Barnhardt. As Klaatu and Helen 
               watch, Barnhardt raps for order and begins to speak. His 
               voice comes in the ship through a speaker.

               He addresses them gravely, with a note of terrible 
               disappointment in his voice.

                         we were to meet here tonight with a 
                         man from another planet -- the man 
                         who came here in this ship.
                              (there are audible 
                              exclamations of 
                              surprise and 
                              disappointment)
                         As you all know, this is no longer 
                         possible. I can only say that I share 
                         the bitterness of your disappointment.

               INTERCUT with the above are group and individual shots of 
               the people in the meeting. They are the cream of Earth's 
               intellectuals -- scientists, churchmen, educators, leaders 
               of social and political thought. There are several women 
               among them. There are turbaned Indians, Chinese, Japanese, 
               several Negroes. All religions are represented. Every 
               important world power is represented.

               Klaatu and Helen are watching and listening, as the last 
               sentence of Barnhardt's speech above comes over the speaker. 
               Klaatu flips off the switch, which cuts off the view of the 
               meeting and also Barnhardt's voice. At this moment Gort moves 
               across the cabin and Klaatu speaks to him.

               Gort moves off obediently.

               Full of chagrin, he continues addressing the meeting.

                         is for our safety, I can do nothing 
                         but suggest that we comply--

               Barnhardt is interrupted by the sudden and unexpected 
               appearance of the ramp, silently opening out of the side of 
               the space ship.

               as they react in startled amazement to the mysterious 
               appearance of the ramp. Then, as they watch, there is a sudden 
               gasp of terror.

               ground. In a moment, Klaatu and Helen appear at the entrance 
               of the ship. Helen comes down the ramp to join Barnhardt, 
               while Klaatu remains at the head of the ramp.

               The Colonel stands near the door, flanked by a group of 
               soldiers, their rifles at the ready. The Colonel is startled 
               by what he sees. His eyes are on the revered figure of Klaatu 
               and he's debating what he should do.

               He is a figure of intense dignity in his impressive otherworld 
               tunic. He stares with even defiance at the armed soldiers, 
               as though holding them off by sheer weight of his personality. 
               He turns to look out at the audience, which is held 
               spellbound. Then, after a breathless moment, he speaks.

<b>               MED. SHOT
</b>
               CAMERA MOVES IN on Klaatu as he is saying goodbye to Barnhardt 
               and Helen. He turns then and speaks to Gort, glancing up at 
               the building as he does so.

<b>                                     KLAATU
</b>                         Gort -- veracto.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT - GORT
</b>
               He looks up at the roof of the building, and once again we 
               hear the peculiar generating sound from within him.

<b>               MED. LONG SHOT
</b>
               including the delegates, the space ship, everything that is 
               inside the building. As we watch, the roof and walls of the 
               temporary structure suddenly disintegrate as the tanks did 
               in the opening. The entire layout -- delegates, space ship 
               and all -- remain exactly as they were except that instead 
               of being under a roof they are out in the open Mall under a 
               starry sky. The area is ringed with the debris of the 
               building.

<b>               MED. SHOT AT SHIP
</b>
               Klaatu is standing at the head of the ramp as Gort comes up 
               the ramp and disappears inside the ship. Klaatu is nodding 
               goodbye to Barnhardt and Helen.

<b>               TWO SHOT - BARNHARDT AND HELEN
</b>
               as they wave to Klaatu. Barnhardt is moved and impressed, 
               and Helen's face shows her emotions at this strange parting.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU
</b>
               He nods and smiles at them with warm affection. Then he turns 
               and disappears into the ship, and the ramp closes behind 
               him.

<b>               MED. SHOT - THE SPACE SHIP
</b>
               From inside the ship comes the muffled roar of great power 
               generating -- not the sound of earthly motors, but of a 
               tremendous dynamo.

<b>               MED. SHOT - THE DELEGATES
</b>
               watching breathless, stunned by what they have heard and 
               seen.

<b>               MED. LONG SHOT - THE SHIP
</b>
               As the sound from inside it builds to a climax, the great 
               ship takes off with a tremendous roar.

<b>               REACTION CUTS OF DELEGATES
</b>
               All are deeply moved and impressed. In the mind of each is 
               the burning question that Klaatu has posed for them.

<b>               LONG SHOT - THE SHIP
</b>
               as it soars away into the inky blackness of the outer spaces 
               from which it came.

<b>                                                                  FADE OUT:
</b>
<b>                                         THE END
</b>
