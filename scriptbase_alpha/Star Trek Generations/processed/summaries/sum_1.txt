It is the late 23rd century.
Retired Starfleet officers James T. Kirk, Montgomery Scott and Pavel Chekov are guests of honor aboard the newly-christened Enterprise-B.
However, a test run takes an unexpected turn when the starship encounters two vessels trapped inside the Nexus, a mysterious energy ribbon.
During a perilous rescue attempt, Kirk is swept out into space.
Seventy-eight years later, Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the crew of the Enterprise-D rescue an El-Aurian scientist named Tolian Soran.
Unbeknownst to Picard, Soran harbors a deadly plan that includes the destruction of the Enterprise and millions of lives.
Now Picard's only hope for the future rests within the Nexus... and a legendary captain from the past.
