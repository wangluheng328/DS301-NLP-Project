<b>                   FADE IN:
</b>
<b>               1   EXT. SPACE (VFX-I)                                           1
</b>
                   A vast and sparkling starfield. A pinpoint of LIGHT 
                   appears and starts moving toward the camera... a small 
                   and distant cylindrical object tumbling end over end, 
                   but we can't determine exactly what it is yet...

<b>               2   EXT. WHEATFIELD - DAY                                        2
</b>
                   A vast and undulating sea of wheat. We become aware 
                   that there are two HEADS sticking out of the stalks of 
                   wheat: two men are standing and looking up at the 
                   sky. As we move towards them,  we begin to hear their
                   conversation...and we can see that the two men are 
                   SCOTTY and CHEKOV, dressed in civilian clothing.

<b>                                           CHEKOV
</b>                                     (points to sky)
                             There he is -- there, to the 
                             South!

<b>                                           SCOTTY
</b>                                     (peers upward)
                             What are ye, blind? That's a 
                             bird.

                   As they stare up at the sky...

<b>               3   EXT. SPACE (VFX-I)                                           3
</b>
                   The cylinder tumbling through space is now closer, and 
                   we can now see that it is a BOTTLE of some sort, and it 
                   is tumbling directly toward the camera...

<b>               4   EXT. WHEATFIELD- DAY                                         4
</b>
                   As before, Chekov and Scotty staring at the sky.

<b>                                           SCOTTY
</b>                                     (concerned)
                             Repelling the Crystalline 
                             Trench... rafting down lava 
                             flows... orbital skydiving. it's 
                             like the man is running a bloody 
                             decathlon across the galaxy.

                   Suddenly we hear a double SONIC BOOM.

<b>                                           CHEKOV
</b>                                     (re: sound)
                             That should be him now. I think 
                             he's just crossed the sound 
                             barrier.

                   They shield their eyes against the sun and look up.

<b>               5   EXT. SPACE (VFX-I)                                           5
</b>
                   The bottle gets CLOSER...

<b>               6   EXT. WHEATFIELD - DAY                                        6
</b>
                   A man in a high-tech body harness and parachute LANDS 
                   in the wheat flat on his back. His body-suit is 
                   charred, scorched, wisps of smoke still curling off of
                   it. There are small thrusters attached to his backpack 
                   and boots. Scotty and Chekov move to him. The man 
                   removes his helmet. Revealing that it is KIRK. He 
                   smiles broadly, like a child who has just come off a
                   roller-coaster.

<b>                                           KIRK
</b>                             Right on target! I jump out over 
                             the Arabian Peninsula... and I end 
                             up here, right on the dime.

                   Kirk gets to his feet.

<b>                                           CHEKOV
</b>                             Actually, Captain, your precise 
                             target area was thirty-five 
                             meters...
                                     (points)
                             That way.
<b>

</b>                             Thanks for pointing that out.

                   Kirk starts to pull off his suit, reacts to a sudden 
                   pain in his back.

<b>                                           KIRK
</b>                             Oh...

<b>                                           SCOTTY
</b>                             I've warned ye about that back of 
                             yours. You should have a doctor 
                             take a look at it.

                   Kirk waves him away, and continues to remove his 
                   harness.

<b>              6A   EXT. SPACE (VFX-I)                                          6A
</b>
                   The tumbling bottle rushes past, and we can now see 
                   that it is a CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE - Dom Perignon, 2265. 
                   Follow the bottle as it tumbles through space...

<b>              6B   EXT. WHEATFIELD - DAY                                       6B
</b><b> 
</b>                   Kirk, Scotty and Chekov as before.

<b>                                           KIRK
</b>                             Tomorrow I want to make a tri-
                             elliptical jump. That's where you 
                             jump out over Northern China, and 
                             make three complete orbits before 
                             you start re-entry...

<b>                                           CHEKOV
</b>                             Captain. Perhaps you have 
                             forgotten that tomorrow is the 
                             christening ceremony.

                   This strikes a nerve with Kirk -- we see a flash of
                   hesitation and irritation cross his face.

<b>                                           KIRK

                             set foot on a starship again, and 
                             I meant it.

                   A large picture window overlooking the starship in its

                   CLOSE ON A SET OF TURBOLIFT DOORS as they slide open to

                   into their faces and they react. MOVE TO REVEAL -
                   that the bright light is coming from a futuristic
                   CAMERA with a small bank of lights attached to it. The 
                   camera is a holographic recorder with two lenses and is 
                   worn on an operator's head. There are four JOURNALISTS 
                   clustered in front of the Turbolift -- one associated 
                   with the camera, the others using PADDS to make 
                   notations.

                   Also clustered around the door are the BRIDGE CREW of 
                   the Enterprise-B. Everyone is APPLAUDING as Kirk and

                   Bridge.

                   Harriman is young, confident, eager -- this is his 
                   first command and he takes it very seriously.

                             school.

                   The original Enterprise officers all stop and give him 
                   a look. Harriman looks a little embarrassed -- he 
                   didn't mean to insult them. But Kirk gives him a
                   little smile, lets it roll off.

                   her.

                             years without James T. Kirk in

                             that?

                   The Journalist has unknowingly touched a nerve. Kirk's 
                   eyes flash for a moment -- the longer he's on this 
                   Bridge, the more he realizes he doesn't feel good about 
                   it at all. He tries to shrug it off with a smile.

                   He tries to move away from the Journalist, who dogs 
                   him.

                   At this point, Chekov approaches with a young, (mid-
                   twenties) attractive, Asian female Ensign named DEMORA.

                   Kirk is shocked. For a long moment, he stares at her

                   height.

                   Demora and Chekov move off and Kirk looks after them 
                   for a long beat. The expression on his face changes 
                   from shock to sadness... Something is clearly 
                   bothering him.

                   But Kirk's mind is still on Demora. He watches her as

                   The COM OFFICER hits a few commands in response.

                   We hear the voice of a crewmember who sounds panicked 
                   and urgent.

                             It' tearing us --

                   The voice is drowned out by STATIC. The SCIENCE 
                   OFFICER checks something on his console. The 
                   Journalist with the Holo-camera turns on his light and 
                   pans it around to capture the action.

                   The Holo-camera light is shined on Harriman as he 
                   shifts in his seat, hesitant to take the plunge. Kirk 
                   is drumming his fingers impatiently on his leg. 
                   Finally, Harriman takes a breath and straightens his

                             survive much longer.

                   The ship suddenly SHAKES. The Navigator works his

                   Harriman frowns at the screen, trying to figure out 
                   what to do. Kirk can barely contain himself -- to him 
                   the answer is obvious. He blurts out the answer --

                   Scotty quickly elbows him in the side -- this isn't 
                   Kirk's ship. Kirk shuts up.  Harriman glances at Kirk.

                   When Kirk hears this order, he shakes his head slightly 
                   and mouths the word "no" under his breath. He knows 
                   that won't work.

                             interference, Captain.

                   Harriman frowns again, trying to come up with another
                   solution, but it isn't easy -- it's his first day in 
                   command; his ship is under-manned and ill-prepared. 
                   It's a nightmare come true. Kirk is itching to get in 
                   On this, his fingers digging into the arms of his chair --
                   but he restrains himself.

                   A tense beat. Harriman glances over at the 
                   journalists, then glances over at Kirk. Kirk gives him 
                   a pained smile, trying to be encouraging even though he 
                   knows this is not the right course of action.

                   Suddenly the right-hand ship on the screen is engulfed

                   Harriman pales at the sight... seems shell-shocked by 
                   the destruction of the ship. He's overwhelmed now, at 
                   a genuine loss as to what to do next.

                   and dressed in distinctive clothing. The survivors are 
                   in various states of shock. Many sit on the floor, 
                   staring into middle distance. some lie on tables, 
                   unconscious. others are mumbling incoherently to 
                   themselves. Chekov and the Journalists are moving from 
                   person to person trying to get control of the 
                   situation as the ship is ROCKED and FLUNG about.

                   He looks at the tricorder.

                   One Journalist moves past a man sitting on a bio-bed 
                   with a dazed look on his face. He has a nasty-looking 
                   wound on one side of his face. (We will later learn 
                   that this man is named DOCTOR SORAN.)

                   The journalist is about to turn away when suddenly 
                   Soran GRABS him roughly -- clearly a man of great 
                   Strength -- and pulls him close. Soran's eyes are 
                   suddenly wild, crazed.

                             Let me go!

                   Soran begins to attack the journalist, but before he 
                   can do any real damage, Chekov injects Soran with a 
                   hypospray and Soran falls unconscious.

                   Suddenly a WOMAN with her back toward us stumbles 
                   nearby. Chekov quickly grabs her arm and catches her 
                   before she falls.

                   The woman turns around and we see her face for the 
                   first time -- it's GUINAN. She seems dazed and 
                   confused. Chekov smiles at her warmly.

                             day would come. Are you prepared 
                             to face the charges?

                   Worf doesn't answer and Troi jabs him in the side.

                   Picard looks to Riker, who then pulls out a large, 
                   rolled piece of parchment. He opens the scroll and 
                   begins to read from it. In the b.g. Geordi removes 
                   Worf's shackles.

                   shakes his hand.

                   Picard continues to smile at him for a moment...then 
                   Riker steps in.

                   Worf's face registers surprise as everyone GRABS HIM
                   and hauls him toward the side, where a long plank is 
                   being pushed out over the water.

                             plank... etc.

                   Picard gives Riker a questioning look.

                             to the lions, remember?

                   Picard shrugs it off... it's not exactly his cup of 
                   tea, but he'll go along with it.

                   Worf is hustled to the rail where BEVERLY is waiting 
                   patiently by the plank, holding a long PIKE. Worf is 
                   put on the plank and Crusher prods him with the pike 
                   until Worf is nearly at the end.

                   Worf finally stops and turns around.

                   Everyone falls silent a moment. Worf looks over 
                   the side at the water below.

                             convincing.

                   Beverly prods him with the pike and Worf FALLS INTO THE
                   SEA  with a huge SPLASH . Everyone LAUGHS and CHEERS.

                   the station...and come to the body of a Starfleet 
                   Science Officer. He has taken a disruptor blast to the 
                   back and there is a nasty-looking scorch mark on his 
                   uniform. Beverly immediately takes some devices out of

                   aside and begin to dig through the debris. Finally, a 
                   HAND can be seen grasping about from within the pile of 
                   rubble. Riker and Worf work faster. Worf grabs the

                   one of the survivors from the Lakul (and last seen 
                   in Sickbay aboard the Enterprise-B). Soran has not aged 
                   at all over the years but he does have a permanent 
                   scar on his face from the earlier wound. He blinks a

                   ENTERS with an odd look on his face...his body 
                   language subtly altered. He is looking at the world 
                   through new eyes. Geordi is following him closely, 
                   watching his every move. They move to the bar. Guinan 
                   comes over -- she has not aged at all since the

                   She pours two glasses of the liquid. Data takes one

                   staring out at the stars, lost in thought. His 
                   observatory uniform is distinctive, and sets him apart 
                   from everyone else in the room. Picard walks up to the

                   imposing physical presence, but at the moment he seems 
                   very much the eccentric scientists consumed with his

                   Picard moves to stand, but Soran reaches out and gently 
                   but firmly grabs him by the arm. The unexpected 
                   physical contact and the change of intensity in Soran's 
                   face stops Picard in his tracks.

                   For some reason, Soran's words have struck a deep chord 
                   within Picard.

                   He looks away from Soran's compelling gaze and thinks 
                   for a long moment. When he finally speaks, his voice

                   Picard is really not in the mood for this. His tone 
                   hardens.

                   Troi eyes an open photo album on the table. She reaches 
                   over and flips through the pages for a moment. There 
                   are many photos inside... from many periods in time
                   including one of Picard's brother standing next to his

                            remember hearing about the family 
                            line. The Picards that fought at 
                            Trafalgar... the Picard's that

                   Picard hesitates -- this is difficult for him.

                   Picard moves to the window, stares outside. A shadow 
                   crosses his face. He's getting to the heart of the 
                   matter.

                   Picard moves back to the photo album, open it to the 
                   last page, an then flips through the remaining pages --
                   they are blank.

                            I always accepted it as a 
                            calculated risk that goes along

                   Soran is standing at a console watching a graphic 
                   depiction of the star's collapse on a monitor when the 
                   door suddenly opens. Soran whirls around and FIRES his 
                   phaser at Riker and Worf. They dive for cover just 
                   outside the room. (NOTE: The probe Geordi examined 
                   earlier is now gone.)

                   Worf dodges another phaser blast and sees Geordi lying 
                   unconscious on the deck. Data is nowhere to be seen.

                            We've got to get out of here!

                   Soran's only answer is another phaser blast.

                   On a monitor where we can see a graphic depiction of

                   We are the inside an old Klingon ship - it's beaten up and 
                   patched in several places, obviously not a first-line 
                   model. Watching the Viewscreen are LURSA and B'ETOR, 
                   two powerful-looking Klingon women... They are sisters. 
                   aggressive... seductive... and very dangerous. Several N.D. 
                   male Klingons man the various stations.

                   The sisters stare at the image of the destroyed sun in 
                   awe.

                   Soran now ENTERS the Bridge. His expression is dark 
                   and angry. He is clearly not a prisoner here and he 
                   strides up to the sisters.

                   But without warning, Soran HITS B'Etor squarely in the 
                   jaw, knocking her back over a console. Several 
                   Klingons leap to their feet, drawing their weapons...
                   but B'Etor holds up a hand as she gets to one knee.

                            more careful in the future.

                   B'Etor grabs Soran and holds a wicked-looking knife to 
                   his throat.

                   Data's expression is still one of concern. Beverly 
                   pulls Riker aside.

                   Beverly activates the wall monitor and a picture of 
                   Doctor Soran along with some biographical information 
                   appears.

                            hundred years old. He lost his 
                            entire family when the Borg 
                            destroyed his world. Soran 
                            escaped with a handful of other 
                            refugees aboard a ship called the 
                            Lakul. The ship was destroyed by 
                            some kind of energy ribbon, but 
                            Soran and forty-six others were 
                            rescued by the Enterprise-B.

                   of the others on the Enterprise. None of the standard 
                   furniture, consoles or decoration are present. The 
                   floor is made of tile, not carpet... the walls are 
                   draped in exotic fabric. The lighting is moody and 
                   subdued.

                   Picard is standing before Guinan, who is sitting cross-
                   legged on the floor. They talk to each other with an 
                   easy familiarity... two old friends who know each 
                   other well.

                   Guinan stands and begins to move about the room...
                   she's clearly troubled by the memories. She hesitates,

                   of awe at the memory.

                   Picard weighs her words... sees the warning in her 
                   eyes... and carefully backs away and EXITS.

                            to you? Did he say why you were 
                            searching for trilithium?

                   On the PADD, we now see the dot has moved to a position 
                   next to Geordi's heart. Soran looks up at Geordi.

                   Soran taps a control on the PADD. Suddenly Geordi
                   grabs his chest in pain. Soran watches Geordi for a 
                   few seconds, then taps the PADD again. Geordi gasps 
                   and starts to breathe.

                   Soran's features soften as he smiles slightly. For a

                   a disturbing contrast to his usual dark intensity.

                   Soran taps a control on the PADD. Geordi gasps and 
                   strains against an unimaginable pain.

                   Soran picks up his pocket watch and opens the cover...

                   star and FOUR PLANETS. The RED LINE moves directly 
                   through the system -- it passes very close to the third

                   their stations. The ship is at Red Alert. Data's mood

                   another pebble toward the root. This time, the pebble 
                   bounces underneath the arch and rolls onto the plateau -
                   inside the forcefield. Picard keeps his expression

                   the ornament was designed and it's simply one of many 
                   ornaments on the tree.

                   reacts. The image of the ornament has touched a nerve 
                   within him somewhere. It has reminded him of something 
                   he'd nearly forgotten - a discordant note in an 
                   otherwise wondrous and magical scene. He frowns, the 
                   reverie momentarily disrupted. But he tries to push it 
                   aside, not wanting the spell to be broken. He stands 
                   and turns away from the tree and looks out a nearby 
                   window -- it's snowing and the beautiful image of snow 
                   soothes him for a moment. Then he reacts to something.

                   There's a general rush toward the adjacent dining room. 
                   The youngest boy looks at Picard, goes over to him and 
                   takes his hand.

                   heart swells, the temptation to stay here and live this 
                   out is profound. Almost in a trance, he takes a few 
                   steps with the child toward the dining room... His eye 
                   is caught again by the unusual ornament on the tree for a 
                   moment... torn between the two images. and then, in 
                   one of the most difficult moments of his life, he bends

                   Suddenly there's the cry of a HAWK from offscreen. 
                   Picard turns at the sound --

                   Picard finds himself standing outside a rustic, but
                   Architecturally striking house with spectacular views 
                   in the Canadian Rockies. A hawk is circling overhead, 
                   making the crying sound that Picard heard. The air is
                   cold, frigid -- Picard can see his breath. Picard is 
                   just starting to adjust to this sudden change in 
                   location when he hears the sound of wood being CHOPPED
                   from around the corner of the house. Picard moves to 
                   look around the corner and sees -

                   James T. Kirk. He's still in his uniform and looks 
                   exactly as he did the last time we saw him aboard the  
                   Enterprise-B at the beginning of the film. He is 
                   vigorously chopping wood with an axe. He's enjoying 
                   himself, lost in the sheer pleasure of the manual
                   labor. He's never felt this good in his life. There's 
                   no trace of back pain or any other ailment. Picard 
                   recognizes the famous Captain - as would any 24
                   Century Starfleet officer.

                   Kirk pauses, looks up at the strange man before him. 
                   His expression is wondrous, almost child-like. Like in    
                   Picard's Christmas sequence, Kirk is immersed in the 
                   sensual feeling of the Nexus. It's like a dream that's
                   over-powered him.

                   Kirk points to a nearby log on the woodpile.

                   It takes Picard a beat before he realizes that Kirk 
                   wants him to put the log on the chopping block for him.

                   Picard places the log on the block and Kirk gives it a 
                   vigorous chop with the axe.

                   Picard follows his look to see SMOKE billowing out of 
                   one of the windows of the house. Kirk rushes into the 
                   house, and Picard follows...

</b>
                   Kirk rushes in. The kitchen's decor is 19th century 
                   with a few 23rd Century touches -- copper pans and an 
                   antique stove mixed comfortably with computer consoles 
                   and Starfleet paraphernalia. Picard hesitates in the 
                   doorway -- a little unsure about rushing into some 
                   stranger's house.

                   Kirk yanks a burning frying pan of food off the stove. 
                   It's very hot -- he quickly sets it down near the sink, 
                   waves the smoke away with his hand.

                             Come on in, it's all right. This

                             to be, I sold it years ago.

                   Picard comes in and tries to orient Kirk to what's 
                   going on.

                   Before Kirk can react to this remark, an antique CLOCK
                   on a shelf CHIMES as it strikes the hour. Kirk moves 
                   to the shelf and looks at the clock in surprise and 
                   wonder -- he is entranced by this experience, beginning 
                   to connect with things and memories from his past.

                             century.

                   Kirk hears what Picard is saying, but like Picard in 
                   his fantasy, he is more interested in the sights and 
                   sounds around him. A dog barks from o.c. They both 
                   look as a large black dog bounds into the room and greets 
                   Kirk with enthusiasm.

                             He's been dead seven years.

                   Kirk is still looking around the kitchen when suddenly we 
                   hear a WOMAN'S VOICE from somewhere upstairs that 
                   stops Kirk in his tracks. As she speaks, we can see 
                   the shock on Kirk's face.

                   A beat.

                   Kirk looks at the food on the stove. He's beginning to 
                   realize something.

                   Kirk glances at Picard.

                             past...

                   Kirk moves to a drawer and opens it. Inside is a 
                   HORSESHOE with a tiny red bow tied to it. This 
                   confirms things for Kirk. He picks up the horseshoe.

                             Starfleet...

                   Kirk is swept up in the moment, overwhelmed by 
                   memories, sensations, feelings. He goes back to the 
                   frying pan and looks at the contents with a sudden 
                   burst of recognition.

                             And I gave her this.

                   Picard steps in.

</b>                             I know how real this must seem to

                             Really your house. We've both   
                             been caught up in some sort of 
                             temporal nexus.

                   But Kirk's mind is clearly elsewhere... he's being 
                   swept away by the emotion of the moment... realizing the
                   opportunity he suddenly has.

</b>                             Dill weed.

                   Kirk indicates a shelf, as if asking Picard to go to 
                   it.

<b>                                           KIRK

                             right behind the nutmeg.

                   Kirk moves to the stove and tosses out the ruined eggs. 
                   He cracks open two new eggs on the skillet and begins  
                   preparing a breakfast. Picard waits for a moment, then 
                   goes to the shelf, grabs the dill weed and hands it 
                   to Kirk.

                   Kirk takes the bottle and uses it to season the eggs.

                             these, will you?

                   Kirk moves to a cabinet and begins putting plates on a    
                   breakfast tray. Picard is getting a little impatient, 
                   but stirs the eggs anyway.

                             Thanks.

                   Kirk takes the pan of eggs back from Picard.

                   But Picard's words mean almost nothing to Kirk. He is  
                   Thoroughly enjoying himself and Picard is almost a
                   distraction. Kirk begins serving the eggs onto the 
                   plates and grabs a small vase of flowers to put on the
                   tray.

                   Then he remembers and turns to look at a nearby toaster -- 
                   as if on cue, two slices of toast pop out. Kirk grins 
                   and puts the toast on the plates. Kirk picks up the 
                   tray and heads for the door.

                   Kirk goes out of the kitchen and Picard follows...

                   Kirk brushes past Picard and stops at the foot of the

                   Picard suddenly finds himself standing in the doorway 
                   of a wooden barn. Straw on the floor... farm 
                   implements on the walls... sunlight streaming in 
                   through the slats. There are stalls in the barn with 
                   a few horses visible. 

                   Kirk is standing a short distance away -- he looks 
                   surprised as well... and he is no longer holding the
                   tray of food.

                             I took that horse out for a ride 
                             seven years ago... on a spring 
                             day.

                   Kirk moves to the barn door and opens it revealing a  
                   beautiful spring day.

                             this is the day I met Antonia.

                             one.

                   Kirk grabs the horse, swings up onto the saddle, and 
                   rides out of the barn, filled with excitement. Picard 
                   watches him for a moment, then looks at one of the 
                   other horses in the barn. he makes a decision and
                   then moves toward a saddle hanging on the wall...

                   Kirk is riding his horse hard over the countryside --
                   and across a stream... through a thicket of trees... and 
                   finally out onto a rolling plain. There is a large 
                   RAVINE up ahead. Kirk sees it and smiles tightly. He 
                   spurs his horse faster toward the ravine... The horse 
                   is tearing along... comes up to the edge of the 
                   precipice, and makes a daring leap to the other side.
<b> 
</b>                   Horse and rider land together and Kirk spurs the horse 
                   on. But as he rides, we begin to see a change come 
                   over him -- a look of doubt crosses his face. 
                   Something's not right. He slows the horse to a trot...
                   and then to a complete stop. He sits there for a 
                   moment and frowns. turns and looks back at the 
                   ravine, which is now a fair distance away. Something 
                   about that jump is nagging at him...

                   He turns his horse around and then digs in his heels. 
                   The horse breaks into a gallop, racing back toward the  
                   ravine. 

                   Kirk grips the reins tight in his hands and then the 
                   horse makes the LEAP across yet again.

                   This time when Kirk lands, he brings his horse to an   
                   immediate stop. We can see on his face that something 
                   is very wrong. He turns and stares at the ravine with 
                   a mixture of shock and sadness on his face.

                   In the distance, Picard can be seen approaching on a 
                   horse of his own. He stops next to Kirk. There is a 
                   long, quiet moment as the two men sit there side by 
                   side. Kirk is introspective as he sorts through his
                   feelings...

                             the hell out of me. But not this

                   A quiet beat. Kirk turns and looks toward a particular 
                   hill in the distance, shading his eyes against the 
                   bright sun. Picard follows his gaze and we can now see 
                   the distant figure of a WOMAN walking her horse.

                             matters...

                   All euphoria is now gone from Kirk -- It's a moment of 
                   self-revelation. He glances around.

                   hears what Kirk is saying but also knows that's not the

                   determination.

                   unexpectedly, a smile spreads across his face.

<b>             183   INT. READY ROOM - DAY                                      183
</b>
                   Picard and Riker are sifting through the rubble of what 
                   once was the Ready Room, looking for something...

                   Riker sees something in the rubble.

<b>                                           RIKER
</b>                             Is this it?

                   Riker holds up the family photo album seen earlier.

<b>                                           PICARD
</b>                                     (relieved)
                             Yes, Number One. Thank you.

                   He takes the album... brushes off the dust and flips 
                   through the pages for a moment. Riker looks around the  
                   wrecked room.

<b>                                           RIKER
</b>                             I'm going to miss this ship. She 
                             went before her time.

                   Picard has been rejuvenated by his experience... given 
                   a new perspective on the issues of life and death.

<b>                                           PICARD
</b>                             It's not how many years you've 
                             lived, Wil... but how you've lived 
                             them.
                                     (beat) 
                             Someone once told me that time is 
                             a predator that stalks us all our 
                             lives. But maybe time is also a 
                             companion who goes with us on 
                             our journey, and reminds us to 
                             cherish the moments of our 
                             lives... because they will never 
                             come again. 
                                     (beat) 
                             We are after all. only mortal.

                   A quiet moment... Riker finally smiles.

<b>                                           RIKER
</b>                             Speak for yourself, sir. I kinda 
                             planned on living forever.

                   Picard smiles back at him and the two men EXIT to...

<b>             184   INT. MAIN BRIDGE - DAY (VFX-P)                             184
</b>
                   Riker and Picard ENTER from the Ready Room. They look 
                   around the wrecked Bridge for a moment. Riker glances 
                   at the captain's chair.

<b>                                           RIKER
</b>                             I always thought I'd have a crack 
                             at this chair one day.

<b>                                           PICARD
</b>                             You may still... somehow I doubt 
                             this will be the last ship to 
                             carry the name Enterprise.

                   A beat, then Picard hits his combadge.

<b>                                           PICARD
</b>                                     (continuing, to com)
                             Picard to Farragut. Two to beam 
                             up.

                   The two men dematerialize.

<b>                   FADE TO BLACK.
