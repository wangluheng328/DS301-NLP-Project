The film follows the story of a young poker player who comes to 30s New Orleans to face the best player of the country, the one known as "the Man".
The Man has been the master of the game for many years now, so our "hero" thinks it is time for him to take his place.
And he believes he can make it without the "help" a gangster offers.
