Elderly Andrew Marsh is found dead in his bed in what looks to be murder, as a non drug using Andrew was found with cocaine in his system, which exacerbated the medical issues surrounding his heart condition.
Rebecca Carlson, Andrew's much younger girlfriend, is on top of the suspect list.
She hires a lawyer, Frank Dulaney, before she is even questioned or charged by the police.
But she is eventually charged.
Key to the case is motive, with Rebecca standing to inherit Andrew's $8 million fortune (which she states she being named his primary beneficiary she knew nothing about).
The case also stands on Rebecca and seemingly Andrew's "aggressive" sexual behavior, which included BDSM, with most believing that Rebecca was trying to "screw" him to death.
This brings into question Rebecca's past relationships, as well as the behavior of those around Andrew, such as his personal secretary Joanne Braslow, who would like to see Rebecca convicted more than anything.
As Frank begins to work on the case, he gets lured into Rebecca's seduction and the thought of entering into the world of BDSM with her, despite he being happily married.
This personal relationship with his client provides additional motivation to help her get acquitted, which he feels is his job anyway despite her guilt or innocence.
