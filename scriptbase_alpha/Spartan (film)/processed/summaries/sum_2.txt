In the US-government's special ops, Scott is a shooter, not a planner, doing the job without regard to quaint or obsolete convention.
When a Harvard undergrad goes missing (the daughter of a US leader), it's Scott who applies the pressure, first to her boyfriend, then to a madam whose cathouse is the initial stop en route to a white slavery auction in Dubai.
The abductors may not know the girl's identity, but once they figure it out, she's doomed.
Deadly double crosses force Scott to become a planner.
Through it all, earnest TV newscasters read the drivel they're handed.
