In September 1939, Władysław Szpilman, a Polish-Jewish pianist, plays on radio in Warsaw when the station is bombed during Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland at the outbreak of World War II.
Hoping for a quick victory, Szpilman rejoices with family at home when learning that Britain and France have declared war on Germany.
But Germany defeats Poland quickly and its troops enter Warsaw, where life for Jews deteriorates as the Nazi authorities prevent them from working or owning businesses and force them to wear blue Star of David armbands.
