               Behind the main title and the credits:

<b>               EXT. PLAINS COUNTRY - CLOSE SHOT - MOVING JUST ABOVE GROUND 
</b><b>               LEVEL - A STUDY OF HOOFPRINTS - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
               The hoofprints are deeply etched in the ground, picking their 
               way through scrubby desert growth. An occasional tumbleweed 
               drifts with the light breeze across the pattern of prints; 
               and lightly-blown soil and sand begin the work of erasing 
               them. The CAMERA FOLLOWING the hoofprints

<b>               RAISES SLOWLY TO:
</b>
<b>               EXT. PLAINS COUNTRY - LONG SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
               We see the rider now. BACK TO CAMERA, jogging slowly along -- 
               heading down a long valley toward a still-distant ranch house 
               with its outlying barn and corrals.

<b>               EXT. PLAINS COUNTRY - MED. SHOT - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
               The CAMERA FRAMES and MOVES with the lone horseman. He is 
               ETHAN EDWARDS, a man as hard as the country he is crossing.

               Ethan is in his forties, with a three-day stubble of beard.

               Dust is caked in the lines of his face and powders his 
               clothing. He wears a long Confederate overcoat, torn at one 
               pocket, patched and clumsily stitched at the elbows.

               His trousers are a faded blue with an off-color stripe down 
               the legs where once there had been the yellow stripes of the 
               Yankee cavalry. His saddle is Mexican and across it he carries 
               a folded serape in place of the Texas poncho...

               Rider and horse have come a long way. The CAMERA HOLDS and 
               PANS the rider past and we see another detail; strapped onto 
               his saddle roll is a sabre and scabbard with a gray silk 
               sash wrapped around it... Horse and rider pass, moving closer 
               to the ranch as a little girl and a small dog come tearing 
               around the corner of the house.

<b>               EXT. THE YARD OF THE EDWARDS RANCH - MED. SHOT - DEBBIE - 
</b><b>               LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
               She is staring wide-eyed at the distant horseman o.s.

               Her little dog has seen him too and is barking excitedly.

               DEBBIE quickly reaches to grab the dog by the scruff of the 
               neck, crouching over him. Debbie is 11 years old with a 
               piquant, memorable face.

<b>               EXT. THE YARD - CLOSE SHOT - DEBBIE
</b>
               Here we must establish and dramatize what it is about her 
               face that is memorable, so that if we were to see her again 
               five or six years later, we would know it is she -- perhaps 
               the eye color or the slant of eyebrow, or a trick of 
               scratching bridge of nose with crooked forefinger.

<b>               EXT. THE EDWARDS HOUSE - MED. SHOT - AARON - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
               The ranch house is of adobe, solidly built, with a sod and 
               cross-timbered roof, deep windows. A small gallery or porch 
               extends across the front. AARON EDWARDS comes through the 
               door, attracted by the dog's barking -- and then he, too, 
               sees the approaching horseman and comes farther out -- curious 
               but not at all apprehensive. Aaron is a lean, weathered and 
               tired man, with a down-swept mustache; a gentler-looking man 
               than Ethan and possibly a few years older.

               As he squints off, studying the rider, his older daughter, 
               LUCY, comes out to stand behind him. Lucy is from 16 to 18 -- 
               a pleasant, feminine girl. She is carrying a mixing bowl 
               with some sort of batter in it, which she now completely 
               forgets to whip in her interest in the approaching stranger.

               In the next instant MARTHA EDWARDS follows the daughter onto 
               the porch. Martha is a still-lovely woman, although the years 
               have etched fine wrinkles about her eyes and mouth, and work 
               has worn and coarsened her hands. Those hands will never be 
               idle when Martha is on scene... And now, while she shares 
               the family's interest in the approaching horseman, she 
               automatically notes that Lucy has forgotten her task -- and 
               she takes the mixing bowl from her and stirs the batter.

<b>               EXT. YARD OF THE EDWARDS HOUSE - FULL SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
               Along the side of the house comes BEN EDWARDS, 14, with a 
               man-sized armload of chunkwood clutched to his chest. He, 
               too, has spotted the stranger and is all attention. So much 
               so that he trips, but recovers his footing. He pauses to 
               dump the wood into a woodbox by the door -- his eyes always 
               riveted on the oncoming rider -- and then he moves toward 
               the others, biting a splinter out of a finger. Beyond Ben, 
               MARTIN PAULEY emerges from the barn and crosses the open 
               ground heading toward CAMERA. Martin is somewhat under 20, a 
               lithe, perfectly coordinated male animal, with Indian-straight 
               hair and a white man's eyes. He is carrying bridle or other 
               horse-gear. He looks to the family on the porch -- to see if 
               they recognize the stranger -- then out again. He continues, 
               followed by Ben, toward where

               Debbie crouches over her dog.

<b>               EXT. PLAINS COUNTRY - LONG SHOT - ETHAN - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
               As he rides downslope toward the house.

<b>               THE CREDITS END.
</b>
<b>               EXT. THE EDWARDS RANCH - MED. CLOSE SHOT - MARTHA, LUCY, AND 
</b><b>               AARON - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
               Suddenly, Martha's eyes widen as she -- even before Aaron -- 
               recognizes the distant rider. Her hand goes to her mouth to 
               check the name that trembles on her lips... An instant later 
               Aaron, too, identifies the oncoming horseman.

<b>                                     AARON
</b>                              (incredulous)
                         Ethan?

               He looks at her, frowning, then slowly steps out onto the 
               hard ground. Martha hands the bowl back to Lucy and follows 
               Aaron.

<b>               EXT. THE YARD OF THE EDWARDS HOUSE - FULL SHOT - THE GROUP
</b>
               as Ethan rides in and sits his horse, looking down at them.  
               There is a noticeable constraint on all of them. Finally:

<b>                                     ETHAN
</b>                         Hello, Aaron...

               His eyes shift to Martha and hold. Ethan is, and always has 
               been, in love with his brother's wife and she with him.

<b>                                     ETHAN
</b>                         Martha...

<b>                                     MARTHA
</b>                              (a bit shakily)
                         Hello, Ethan.

               Ethan slowly, stiffly swings out of the saddle. Aaron and 
               Martha exchange quick glances... troubled, puzzled. Aaron 
               pastes on an uncertain smile as Ethan comes around his horse 
               toward their side.

<b>                                     AARON
</b>                         How's California?

<b>                                     ETHAN
</b>                         How should I know?

<b>                                     AARON
</b>                         But Mose Harper said...

<b>                                     ETHAN
</b>                         That old goat still creakin' 
                         around?... Whyn't someone bury him?

               He goes to his saddle pack, begins unlacing it. Ben and Debbie 
               have inched closer -- half-shy, half-curious.

               Debbie's dog begins sniffing at his heels. Ethan looks down 
               at them - not unfriendly, just a man not used to children.

<b>                                     ETHAN
</b>                         Ben, ain't you?

               Ben nods.

<b>                                     ETHAN
</b>                              (frowning at Debbie)
                         Lucy, you ain't much bigger than 
                         when I saw you last.

<b>                                     DEBBIE
</b>                         I'm Deborah!
                              (pointing)
                         She's Lucy.

               Ethan looks in the direction of the pointing finger.

<b>               EXT. YARD - ANOTHER ANGLE

               as Martin -- with slightly averted face -- crosses to take 
               the bridle of Ethan's horse and lead him away.

               He completes unlacing the pack and takes it -- treating it 
               as though it contained something of value. Martin watches 
               with a touch of resentment: Ethan doesn't trust him.

               Ethan turns and sees the look. He doesn't care what Martin 
               thinks, nor does he explain. Martin leads the horse off.

               He hesitates, then grudgingly surrenders it -- conscious of 
               its sorry condition.

               He just nods, then turns to follow Aaron around the side of 
               the house toward the wash-up.

               She stands alone, looking after Ethan -- his coat in her 
               arms. She holds it against her breast for just a moment and 
               her eyes are tender.

<b>               INT. EDWARDS HOUSE - FULL SHOT - NIGHT
</b>
               The family is finishing dinner -- and the scene is not quite, 
               but almost, a still-life. Loud in the room is the pendulum 
               tick of a Seth-Thomas clock on the mantel above the fireplace -- 
               in which logs are burning briskly. Ben crouches near the 
               fireplace, fascinatedly examining the scabbard and sabre 
               Ethan has brought home from the wars.

               He tries to ease the blade just a bit out of its scabbard.

               Aaron sits at one end of the hand-hewn table, Martha at the 
               other. At her right is Ethan, his fork scraping the last 
               crumb off his plate. Lucy sits at her father's right and 
               Martin at his left. Next to Martin is Debbie. In the center 
               of the table is the sorry remnant of what was once a meal. 
               Lucy and Martin have finished eating. Aaron is sipping his 
               coffee, and Martha -- her own plate largely untasted -- is 
               watching Ethan.

               Ethan has shaved, changed his shirt. He straightens 
               contentedly and every eye is on him, expectantly.

               The clock rattles alarmingly -- the usual preliminary to its 
               striking; and then it bangs out the strokes like a fire-alarm 
               gong. Eight fast clangs.

               Martin nods and crosses to kiss Martha good night.

                         Good night, Uncle Ethan.

               Ethan doesn't like being called Uncle -- as we must know 
               from the quick look he shoots at Martin. But he acknowledges 
               it.

               Ben reluctantly puts the scabbard away, turns to Ethan.

               As Ben reluctantly heads out with Martin, Deborah crosses to 
               Ethan's side and studies him gravely.

                         made my neck green or not.

               Ethan looks at her gravely.

                              something, rises)
                         Wait.

               He crosses to where his pack is -- a side table or something -- 
               and burrows into it. Debbie is at his side.

               It is a gold medal or medallion -- something appropriate to 
               Maximilian of Mexico -- suspended by a long multi-colored 
               satin ribbon.

               She holds it high for mother -- and all -- to see. Martha 
               takes it and reacts at its weight.

                         picked up in Mexico.

               Martha reluctantly surrenders it to Debbie's eager hand.

               Aaron hasn't missed the word "Mexico" and looks sharply at 
               Ethan.

               The two girls leave the main room. Martha and Aaron both 
               look at Ethan -- half expecting some further explanation.

               He turns from them and looks into the fire. Martha begins to 
               clear the table. Aaron gets up, takes a pipe and a spill -- 
               lights it at the fire.

               Martha resumes her activity. Ethan crosses to his pack, 
               reaches into it for a leather pouch, brings it back and tosses 
               it onto the table. It lands with a resonant clink.

               Both Martha and Aaron draw close to the table.

               (NOTE TO WINTON HOCH: This scene should be dramatically back-
               lighted.)

               He opens a waistline shirt button and hauls out a leather 
               money belt and drops that on the table.

               He reaches into the belt and takes out a few mint-fresh gold 
               pieces which he slides across the table.

               Martha picks up one of the gold pieces, staring at the face 
               on the coin: the same as that on the medal -- staring sharply 
               then at Ethan. Aaron is examining another coin with a 
               different interest.

               He glances questioningly at Ethan.

</b>                         So?

               Aaron shrugs and crosses to a barrel chair. He raises the 
               seat and lifts out a pair of old boots, some rags of clothing 
               and then raises a false-bottom lid and drops pouch and money 
               belt into it. Carefully he replaces everything. During this 
               Ethan's attention has gone to Martha's hand, to one cut 
               finger, its wound barely healed. He takes the hand -- gently.

               She nods and withdraws the hand.

                         hands.

               She looks quickly at him and self-consciously tries to hide 
               her hands, conscious of their work-worn appearance.

               Then for a moment their eyes meet and hold -- and a world of 
               sadness and hopelessness is in the look.

               Aaron closes the seat of the barrel chair.

               He picks up one of the lamps and starts away toward their 
               bedroom door. Martha looks at Ethan again. His expression is 
               bitter.

</b>                         Night, Ethan... Come 'long, Martha.

               She turns obediently and follows Aaron. Ethan looks after 
               them and waits as Aaron opens the bedroom door. Martha goes 
               into it and Aaron follows and closes the door.

               Ethan crosses to the lamp on the mantel, blows it out.

               Only the firelight strikes his face as he stares broodingly 
               at the closed bedroom door.

</b>
               Debbie's dog is barking excitedly as six horsemen slowly 
               ride toward the house and dismount. A lamp goes on inside.

<b>               THE SIX HORSEMEN ARE:
</b>
               CAPTAIN, THE REVEREND SAM CLAYTON, a big man with frosty 
               blue eyes, graying hair, a bristly full mustache and the air 
               of grave and resolute authority. He is a minister of the 
               Gospel with a .44 on his hip.

               LARS JORGENSEN, the Edwards' neighbor, is a harried little 
               man, Scandinavian. As we shall find out soon, he has a brisk 
               and buxom wife and a rather astonishing brood of children.

               BRAD JORGENSEN is one of these: sandy-haired, brash, amiable, 
               impulsive. He is in his early twenties.

               CHARLIE MacCORRY, slightly older than Brad, is Sergeant of 
               Company A of the Rangers. (He is also Company A.) Charlie is 
               a taciturn, gently-spoken, competent man, clearly patterned 
               by his association with Captain, the Rev. Sam.

               MOSE HARPER is an old scout -- a walking bone-rack, yet 
               capable of tireless feats of endurance. Some think him 
               "tetched" yet he has managed to endure to his age during a 
               time and in a region where few men lived to see their 
               grandchildren. He wears a ragged dark overcoat in all weather, 
               a narrow-brimmed hat with a feather in its band.

               ED NESBY is a rancher and homesteader in his mid-thirties; 
               resolute, honest, self-effacing; nothing picturesque or 
               dramatic about him; just a solid citizen and a realist.

               She is at the window of her bedroom, wrapper clutched with 
               one hand, lamp upraised in the other as she stares into the 
               dawn to see who these callers are. We hear the heavy foot- 
               falls of the approaching men, then a loud knock thrice 
               repeated -- an ominous sound.

               The door is opened by Aaron -- holding a lamp and a gun. He 
               is only partly dressed -- pants, boots, undershirt. The bar 
               of light slashes across the faces of Sam and some of the men 
               behind him.

               Jorgensen enters -- an angry little man -- closely followed 
               by Mose Harper, who is grinning foolishly.

               her an exaggerated cavalier's bow.

               His eyes brighten as he looks toward the fire and spots a 
               rocking chair. He shuffles toward it, plants himself and 
               begins rocking and half-crooning to himself.

               The front door opens to admit Martin, fully dressed and armed, 
               with Charlie MacCorry.

               Martin ranges himself next to Aaron and both face Clayton.

               Martha sets out cups on the table, begins pouring the coffee.

               During the swearing-in, Ethan will enter the room from the 
               inner door -- unnoticed by the other men, but not by Martha.

               And as the scene plays, the audience must always be conscious 
               of the by-play of glances between Martha and Ethan as they 
               face the prospect of being left in this house together.

               As Ethan emerges he is brought to a momentary halt by sight 
               of a couple -- Brad and Lucy -- in each other's arms, standing 
               near the saddled horses of the posse. Clayton and Jorgensen 
               following him out, spot the couple, who now belatedly are 
               conscious of their audience.

               In confusion, Lucy runs back around the side of the house as 
               Brad -- unrepentant -- grins at his irascible old man and 
               heads for his waiting horse. Clayton chuckles and turns toward

               He swings her up in front of his saddle. They start away.

               Ethan is last to ride out. He is watching Martha. He brings 
               a gloved hand up in a salute. She starts to raise her hand 
               but only brings it just above her waist, a fluttering gesture 
               with tremulous fingers. It is the last he will ever see of

               Ethan and Mose are advancing at a steady walk, both men 
               leaning slightly out of their saddles to study the terrain -- 
               the trail they are following. Out to one side -- fifty yards 
               distant -- is the main body of the posse: Sam, Jorgensen, 
               Charlie, Ed, moving roughly parallel to Ethan but at a faster 
               clip. Martin comes riding in toward Ethan from behind CAMERA.

               as it comes up the rise and the men rein in on the crest.

               Jorgensen stares and his face mirrors shock and dismay.

               The other men look down into the long valley on the far side 
               with equally grim expressions.

               Jorgensen doesn't even seem to hear him. Angrily Ethan whips 
               out revolver and fires into the air. Then he swings his arm 
               in a come-back gesture. He rides out ahead then a short 
               distance and dismounts... and slowly the others follow.

               We see now, the bodies of a few bulls stiffening in the sun. 
               Ethan goes to the nearest one. A feathered lance is driven 
               into it. He pulls the lance out. Mose comes over beside him.

                         your place... or my brother's.

               Jorgensen wilts and casts an anguished look back over the 
               miles they have ridden.

               And with that one word, Jorgensen calls upon his son to follow 
               and they take off... fast. Ed Nesby and Charlie MacCorry 
               follow. Sam Clayton pauses.

               others. Ethan shrugs and stoically takes grain bag to feed

               The slanting blaze of the setting sun makes a brilliant area 
               of light in which she is sitting. Beyond her, on the porch 
               steps, Ben is squatting, whittling a piece of pine into a 
               slingshot frame. We hear Martha and Lucy busy with the dishes.  
               Aaron comes from behind CAMERA and stands in the doorway, 
               absently rapping out his pipe. Near the doorway, on a wooden 
               peg, hangs his gun, belt. He puts the pipe in his pocket and 
               glances down at Deborah, intent on her play. He looks swiftly 
               at where the women are busy - then stealthily eases the gun 
               from its holster and slides it under his shirt. He hasn't 
               made a sound and is sure he's got away with it.

               He clears his throat noisily and reaches for a light shotgun 
               pegged above the door.

               Aaron stares as the boy shifts a fold of blanket, or whatever, 
               by his side -- to disclose Ethan's cavalry sabre. Aaron smiles 
               and rubs the youngster's head, then sets out across the yard.

               He is walking through the scrub and brush grass, every sense

               casting each quadrant in turn. Once he whips, gun ready, as

               moves toward its summit, so that only head will be 
               silhouetted. He drops to one knee, half-leaning against the 
               slope and slowly looks out... The CAMERA PANS very slowly, 
               following his careful sweep of the terrain.

               Across the meadow, a shadow seems to touch the grass and at 
               once a covey of quail takes off, whirring loud. Aaron waits 
               no longer, but slides down the slope and starts running at a

               backward.

               achieved in "Yellow Ribbon" in the scene telling of Custer's 
               defeat.

               They are standing in the ruddy glare of the sunset and Ben 
               has Ethan's sabre in his hand. We hear Aaron coming at a 
               run, breathing hard. Ben takes a step as though to go to 
               him, but Martha's hand at once is on his shoulder. Aaron 
               gains the porch.

               He puts finger to his lips, sign for Ben to say nothing.

               Ben nods and goes inside. Aaron and Martha face each other, 
               the question large on her face. Slowly he nods the 
               confirmation of her fears, then gently propels her ahead of

               The room is deeply shadowed except where the dull crimson of 
               the sun through door and windows slashes the blackness.

               Ben is waiting and Martha turns toward Aaron as he pulls the 
               door shut, bars it and sets the shotgun down. He takes the 
               revolver from his waist and Martha holds it as he reaches 
               for his gun belt.

               Buckling on his gun belt, he moves toward the middle of the 
               room, looking around him, taking inventory of his resources.  
               Lucy slowly approaches, biting a knuckle, eyes wide with 
               fright.

               One shutter closes and the bar of light they were standing 
               in goes out. Martha, Aaron and Lucy are dark silhouettes now 
               against the red beam from another window.

               Debbie emerges from a shadowed corner into a beam of light. 
               She is clutching her rag doll, nibbling a cookie. She holds

               Ben closes the shutter. And now the room is almost completely 
               blacked out, except for the dying light filtering through 
               the rifle ports of the closed shutters.

               This should be an expansive view to convey the fact that the 
               posse has split -- the main group heading for the Jorgensen 
               place, Martin forking off to race alone for the Edwards ranch.

               Coming toward and passing CAMERA is Martin, riding all out.

               Several hundred yards away and moving in a divergent direction 
               are the others -- Brad and Charlie, Sam, Jorgensen and Ed 
               Nesby. The men are not compactly bunched, but strung out, 
               each taking his own best course and his own speed... As the 
               riders pass and the dust of their passing, we see two other 
               riders -- Ethan and Mose -- minute specks in the distance, 
               possibly a mile or two behind.

               they pass, becoming one with blue shadows of night.)

               Ethan and Mose are holding their mounts to a jog, in marked 
               contrast to the all-out pace of the others. The CAMERA PANS 
               after them as the dark fingers of the night stretch across 
               the valley. The wind begins to rise and somewhere off in the 
               hills a coyote pack yaps.

               Aaron is little more than a shadowy silhouette as he peers 
               into the night through a partly-opened shutter. Suddenly the 
               room leaps alight as Lucy opens an inner door and enters, 
               holding a lighted lamp. Aaron closes the shutter, spins on 
               her angrily.

               Martha crosses the room swiftly and blows out the lamp.

               In the brief moment the room has been lighted, we see that 
               Lucy is carrying a dark shawl in one hand; that Ben is 
               crouched at another window -- rifle ready; and that Deborah 
               is on her feet -- standing like a child who is being dressed.

               Deborah.

               her with an arm and draws back to the side of the window to 
               watch her go... Outside the little dog barks a welcome and 
               presumably starts to follow the girl. Aaron reacts.

               the ranch. Then he jerks the rifle from its saddle scabbard -- 
               struggling with it because it is under the horse. He freezes 
               then -- listening... And we hear the steady beat of two

                         Uncle Ethan... it's me... Martin!

               Ethan doesn't slacken, nearly rides him down.

</b>                         Out of my way!

               Martin goes sprawling to his hands and knees. Mose continues 
               without slowing.

                         Mose! Wait!...

               He goes running, stumbling after the riders -- desperately 
               calling to them...

</b>                         Ethan!... Mose!...

               And then at the crest of the rising ground, he stops --

               We see in the distance the glow of a fire leading from the 
               barns and the hayricks and the house of Aaron Edwards.

               Martin runs down the slope.

<b>               EXT. YARD AND APPROACH TO EDWARDS HOUSE - WIDE ANGLE - NIGHT
</b>
               (NOTE TO W. HOCH: Here again that use of red is suggested.)

               The ANGLE is past the porch uprights toward Mose and Ethan 
               as they ride in. Little tongues of fire are licking the edges 
               of the uprights. A few arrows, imbedded in the wood, are 
               burning along their shafts. Beyond are the glowing ashes of 
               the hayricks and the charred, smouldering rails of the corral.

               There are no bodies in evidence... The red glow of the burning 
               is on the faces of the men as they dismount.

               Ethan strides to the porch, knocking away one of the blazing 
               arrows as he heads to the door. He stops there -- and what 
               he sees makes the big shoulders droop, the huge frame slump.

               Slowly then -- and removing his hat -- he goes in. Mose 
               shuffles to the edge of the porch and squats there and rocks 
               back and forth, his face working and crying soundlessly with 
               senile grief. We hear a splintered door crash from its hinges 
               within the room and Ethan's muffled voice calling through 
               the house:

<b>                                     ETHAN (O.S.)
</b>                         Lucy?... Deborah? Lucy?

               He strides back through the main room and out onto the porch 
               just as Martin comes at a shambling run across the yard.

               Ethan takes a few steps out toward him. Martin would pass 
               him, but Ethan grabs his arm.

<b>                                     ETHAN
</b>                              (harshly)
                         You stay out!

               Martin tries to fight his arm free.

</b>                         Nothing for you to see.

</b>                         Leggo...

               Ethan turns him and drives a brutal right to his jaw. Martin 
               goes down -- out cold. And only now do we understand how 
               merciful the blow was as Ethan looks compassionately at the 
               fallen figure.

<b>                                     ETHAN
</b>                         Don't let him go in there, Mose...

               And he takes off at a stumbling run for the hilltop.

<b>               EXT. THE HILLOCK WITH THE TWO HEADBOARDS - FULL SHOT - ETHAN

               as he nears the graves.

                         Lucy -- Lucy!

               He runs in, looking around him. He sees the little dog, dead 
               on the ground. And then he sees a shadowed something:

               The shawl Debbie had worn. It is spread out, almost as though 
               concealing a body. Fearfully he stoops and pulls it away...

               There is nothing there, but the shawl. He drops to his knees, 
               his head bowed, his face tortured. The moonlight is clear on 
               the face of the nearer headboard. It is of weathered wood 
               and the chiselled letters on it read:

               The funeral is begun. In the foreground are three newly-

               made crosses at the head of as many open graves -- which we 
               need not see. With head bared, Sam Clayton is concluding his 
               prayer. Near him stand the Jorgensen family: Mrs.  Jorgensen, 
               Lars and LAURIE -- blonde, just beginning to reach her 
               maturity -- and a stepping-stone of tow-headed children.

                         Benjamin Edwards...

               Mrs. Jorgensen and Laurie -- impelled by the same feminine 
               sympathy and interest -- turn to look at Ethan and Martin.

               The PANNING CAMERA picks them up...Ethan standing dry-eyed, 
               looking at the grave of Martha; Martin -- with bruised lip -- 
               looking out across the plain.

               Clayton now opens his small, well-worn Bible to a marked 
               page.

               Ethan looks at him, angrily, impatiently.

               Ethan turns on his heel and walks -- CAMERA PANNING -- to 
               where Ed Nesby has been holding the horses. Brad is already 
               mounting. Mose is there too and Charlie MacCorry.  Silhouetted 
               against the dawn light are the rifles in each man's saddle 
               scabbard. Clayton is right behind Ethan.

               The young riders spur out.

               Ethan is about to mount when Mrs. Jorgensen comes up and 
               catches his arm.

                         fond of Martin...

               Ethan glances back at where Martin and Laurie are standing.

<b>               ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING LAURIE AND MARTIN

               The girl is looking at Martin full of compassion, tries to 
               console him by taking his arm and squeezing it as he stares 
               blindly at the graves and Jorgensen stolidly beginning the 
               work of shovelling them full.

<b>               EXT. NEAR HILLOCK - ETHAN AND MRS. JORGENSEN AS BEFORE

               Ethan looks back at her -- stone-faced.

                         don't let the boys waste their lives 
                         in vengeance!

               Ethan shrugs his arm free and mounts.

               He ignores her and turns angrily to where Martin is.

                         Come on, if you're comin'...

               He digs spurs and rides out with the others. Martin comes 
               over, with Laurie a step behind. His face is set, his eyes 
               almost unseeing.

<b>                                     MRS. JORGENSEN

                         We'll find them...

               He swings into his saddle. Laurie impulsively runs to his 
               side, steps onto the toe of his stirruped boot and pulls 
               herself up to his level to kiss him hard and full upon the 
               mouth.

               He looks at her dully, as though hardly conscious of it. And 
               she is back beside her mother. Martin rides away after the 
               others.

               Comanche head-dress of polished buffalo horn and feathers. 
               Brad doesn't even look up as the men ride in and dismount,

               crosses back to his horse. The men mount (those who have 
               dismounted) and they ride off.

               Brad is looking out into the night -- strain and tension in 
               every line. Beyond them we may see some of the other men -- 
               sitting or sprawled on the ground near a sheltered fire.

               They move off, heading for their blankets. The CAMERA HOLDS 
               on Ethan as he rolls up his blanket and turns on his side.

               He fishes a miniature out of his pocket and gravely studies

               Fog and heavy morning mist rise from the swamp. Some cattails 
               in the near ground. The effect is eerie, very still except 
               for the trilling of frogs. Then, very quietly, the men emerge 
               from the mist swirling around them. They are leading their 
               horses. Sam looks baffled, angry. They stand still, listening -- 
               then slowly continue.

               the ashes of a campfire. The men come through the mist -- 
               wary, vigilant. It is Mose who first spots the fire. He runs 
               to it and drops beside and feels the ashes.

               The mist is thinning as the men warily move along.

               Suddenly there is the faint hoot of an owl from behind and 
               to one side... the men turn slightly, hearing it... A moment 
               later another owl hoot, from the same side but up ahead.

               From the interchange of looks, we must know that the riders 
               are aware of its significance. Mose cups hand to his mouth 
               and he hoots in exact imitation of the other calls. Clayton 
               glares at him.

               Ethan grins wryly. And now the first, faint, ruddy touch of 
               the sun hits the slowly moving horsemen and begins to burn 
               through the mist.

               bespeaks tension, watchfulness. Suddenly -- and every man 
               sees it at the same time -- we see a file of eight Comanches 
               ride slowly out of a canyon at a distance, walking their 
               horses at the same pace and on a course roughly parallel

               and begins to cut in toward the group -- riding slowly, very 
               quietly. Clayton slightly alters course, veering slightly 
               away from the converging files, but still riding slowly. And 
               then, from ahead but at a 100 yards, another Comanche group 
               seems to rise out of the ground and slowly begins closing

               view -- to find themselves opposed by seven veterans, sitting 
               their horses, rifles at their shoulders.

               The charge breaks as the seven rifles bark, almost in unison --

               On the opposite bank, we see the full force of Comanches 
               riding into sight -- racing their mounts to the edge, then 
               wheeling off -- jeering, taunting. Brad starts to bring up

               One Comanche rides a few yards into the water, brandishing 
               his rifle, taunting the white men. A moment later he is joined 
               by a second brave.

               He and Mose slowly bring their rifles to bear -- and then 
               the two shots crack out almost simultaneously. And within 
               split seconds both Comanches fall. The others race away.

               Comanche forces swing from their places of hiding and hit 
               the river. The men open fire, all but Martin, who has frozen,

               Some of the tension leaves Martin. Somehow his gun is in 
               position and he is firing as fast and well as the others.

               The Comanches are coming in, crouched low over their ponies' 
               necks, whooping and firing. Men and horses go down, counted 
               off by the expert marksmanship of the Texans. But they keep 
               coming.

               range work. One Comanche breaks through from the side, his 
               buffalo lance ready for the thrust. Ethan whirls and fires.

               The Comanche horse charges through the defense line and out 
               and there is a muffled scream of pain from Ed Nesby.

               The charge breaks and Comanches wheel left and right, racing 
               back across the river. With magnificent horsemanship, one 
               brave rides to an unhorsed warrior crouched in the shallows 
               and swings him up behind. Two others, riding together, head 
               for one of the two dead Comanches Ethan and Mose had downed 
               on their first shots. Swinging simultaneously from their 
               saddles, they grab the dead man and carry him off.

               Ethan snuggles his rifle to his shoulder as two other racing 
               Comanches prepare to pick up the other dead Indian. Most of 
               the Comanches have regained the far bank now and are racing 
               away. The firing from the Texans has stopped.

               The Comanches have done their work, are riding away -- and

               But now there is no cloud of dust far away -- nothing to

               (NOTE: Ethan's serape, tied behind his saddle, should be 
               clearly seen as he rides away -- not pointed up, but visible.)

               Martin and Brad, riding in a direction opposite to that in 
               which they had taken off -- indicating their circle route -- 
               haul up momentarily as they spot Ethan, standing beside his 
               horse, his back to them, some distance along. They turn 
               slightly off their course and ride out toward him.

<b>               EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - NEAR BUTTE - TWILIGHT
</b>
               Ethan turns, almost startled, as the two youths ride in.

               His serape is no longer behind his saddle. Ethan looks at 
               them blankly for a minute -- as though not really seeing 
               them.

               They both stare at him.

                         again...

               They both can see that.

               They look at him and each other -- for these are clearly 
               unnecessary remarks and doubly surprising coming from Ethan.

                         Was there water in that canyon?

                         Sure I'm all right...

               He goes to his horse, mounts. Martin is right beside him and 
               he notes the missing serape.

               He leads out. Brad rides up beside Martin. Again the two 
               exchange puzzled looks. Martin shrugs and the three continue 
               along the broad trace of the Indian ponies into the setting 
               sun.

               Ethan crouches over a small fire built into a slit trench so 
               that barely the glow of the flames can be seen. Beyond him 
               Martin is leading their unsaddled horses away. The men have 
               come to the end of another long day. Both men look up as 
               Brad comes over a hill slope and rides recklessly down the 
               incline to their camp. His horse is lathered.

               Martin runs to his side as Brad slides off his mount.

               Ethan moves more slowly.

                         I was just swingin' back when I saw

                         I found Lucy back there in that

                         long as I could.

               He can't look at Brad or at Martin. Brad can't speak -- and 
               then finally:

<b>                                     BRAD

               Ethan wheels on him in shouting fury.

                         don't ever ask me more!

               Brad wipes his mouth with the back of his hand. He turns --

               walking stiff-legged as though on stilts back to his horse.

               He bends his head against the saddle, as though to hide his 
               grief. Martin turns away from him and walks back to Ethan.

               And in that moment, Brad mounts and takes off in the same 
               direction from which he had ridden in.

               He comes pounding down a slope, and he takes off his hat and 
               skims it away. He rips off a neckerchief as though to relieve 
               the rush of raging blood.

               He reaches the crest and reins in. A distant firelight is on 
               his face. He takes one moment to look down into the Comanche 
               camp o.s. Then he has his gun out. His eyes are wild, his 
               face wet with sweat. Then he throws back his head and he 
               yells -- and with the yell goes charging into the camp.

               passing o.s. and his eyes are alight with a crazy, savage

               He stands apart, warbow drawn and arrow notched. He releases 
               it at his running target. We hear its impact and a high gasp 
               of pain... and then the jubilant, yammering yells of other 
               Comanches.

               The distant yammering of the Comanches doesn't quite drown 
               out one stifled scream of pain; we can surmise a scalping 
               knife was busy in the last instance of Brad's life. Martin 
               slumps in his saddle. Ethan listens a moment, then turns to 
               Martin.

                         him...

               He turns his horse back the way they had come. Martin stares 
               at him.

                         day...

               Slowly, he rides away. Slowly, reluctantly but helpless to 
               do otherwise, Martin follows.

               fallen from a warbonnet. And then we hear and see the approach

               privation and cold into tragic, fanatic masks.

               Martin has aged years in a matter of months. Falling snow 
               flakes touch their faces and begin to rime their stubbly

               The time is spring. It is a year and a half later.

               The Jorgensen house is larger than the Edwards place -- of 
               sod and logs, with a covered breezeway connecting the two 
               separate buildings of the house: one being the keeping room, 
               the other the sleeping quarters of the numerous Jorgensen 
               brood. A meadowlark breaks into his sudden song. A dog or 
               two come barking around the side of the house as Ethan and 
               Martin ride slowly from behind CAMERA toward the house. In 
               that instant a lamp is lighted within the house and Lars 
               Jorgensen comes to the door.

<b>               EXT. THE JORGENSEN HOUSE - FULL SHOT - NEAR DOOR - TWILIGHT

               Jorgensen peers at the two men as they ride up - recognizing 
               them, of course, but ill-prepared for the change in their 
               appearance and full of unspoken questions.

               Bearing a lamp, Mrs. Jorgensen hurries out to stand beside 
               her husband -- and her face works and tears begin to well in 
               her eyes. Two tow-headed boys -- 13 or 14 -- come after her. 
               Jorgensen makes a little signal with one hand, not even 
               looking at the boys, and they hurry out to take the reins as 
               Ethan and Martin dismount.

               The passage of time has stamped Martin -- and will continue 
               during our story more and more to stamp him -- in the image 
               of Ethan. Now it may show only in the set of his hat or trick 
               of standing; later it will be in his walk, in his speech (or 
               paucity of speech). Neither man is sure of his reception. 
               They are thinking of Brad -- dead because of their search; 
               and Martin is thinking of Laurie. And then Mrs. Jorgensen is 
               running across to Martin and has him in her arms as though 
               he were her son -- saying nothing, just holding him. He stands 
               frozen a moment and then he returns the embrace. Ethan watches 
               a moment, then crosses to Jorgensen.

               Mrs. Jorgensen starts to lead the way inside. Martin hangs 
               back.

               Laurie rushes past her mother.

               She kisses him hard and full on the mouth -- and has no eyes 
               for anyone else. Mrs. Jorgensen looks on with amusement. 
               Martin is just bowled over.

               And Laurie smiles triumphantly at her mother.

                         you was...

               Laurie grabs his hand then and pulls him indoors -- and there 
               is no further resistance from Martin.

               Mrs. Jorgensen and her husband converge then on Ethan -- and 
               her face is gravely questioning.

               Ethan shakes his head. She squeezes his arm reassuringly and 
               they start indoors.

<b>               MARTIN - NIGHT
</b>
               This is a room off the kitchen end of the keeping room --

               and described in the book as the "grandmother room": with 
               narrow, slit-like windows, a set of single bunk beds, possibly 
               a fireplace.

               Martin is in a deep wooden tub, taking a hot bath, currying 
               his back with a long-handled brush. Beyond him is the door. 
               It opens and Martin turns casually -- and at once stops being 
               casual as Laurie enters and purposefully crosses to a stool 
               or bench on which his discarded clothing is scattered.

               She picks up the shirt, puts it over one arm; she reaches 
               for his long-handled and ragged underwear, runs a fist through 
               a hole in its seat, clucks and shreds it into rags. During 
               this:

               And she is laughing as she closes the door behind her.

<b>               INT. THE KEEPING ROOM OF THE JORGENSEN HOUSE - FULL SHOT
</b>
               It is a plastered room, everything bright and shiny; a big 
               wood-burning cookstove, above it a row of shiny copper pots; 
               the furniture handmade and probably not too much unlike the 
               good plain Swedish modern of today.

               There should be Scandinavian accents in the decor. All told, 
               a cheerful, warm-smelling room.

               Ethan is talking as Laurie enters the room still carrying 
               Martin's shirt, the rags of his underwear. She will wait, 
               listening for a break in what Ethan is saying, to try to get 
               her mother's attention. Jorgensen is sitting in his usual 
               chair -- with his boots off, puffing his pipe more or less 
               in tune with what Ethan is talking about. Mrs. Jorgensen is 
               in her rocker, darning or knitting. Ethan is standing near 
               the mantel.

               Mrs. Jorgensen looks up from her darning.

                         Yes, by golly!

               Mrs. Jorgensen stands.

                         don't think it'll be forever.  Someday 
                         this country will be a fine good

                         bones in the ground before that time 
                         can come...

               The speech impresses everyone but Laurie, who probably hasn't 
               heard a word of it.

                         Brad's things?

               There is just the briefest hesitation...

<b>                                     MRS. JORGENSEN
</b>                         Why...'course it would! They're in 
                         the chest...

               And she leads the way briskly, with Laurie following, to a 
               big chest at the far end of the room.

<b>                                     JORGENSEN

                         By golly, the letter... In the chest, 
                         mama... It came for you, Ethan...  
                         last winter...

               Ethan and Jorgensen cross together to where Mrs. Jorgensen 
               is raising the top of a huge dower chest. She extracts a 
               letter, wrapped in oilskin against moths.

<b>                                     JORGENSEN

                         Joab Wilkes of the Rangers brought 
                         it...

               Ethan takes the letter and studies it very carefully before 
               venturing to open it. Jorgensen is quite curious, but trying 
               not to seem nosy. The women remain at the chest -- pulling 
               out various folded garments, etc. Finally Ethan carefully 
               opens it and takes out a letter -- dirty as to paper, crudely 
               printed in pencil and with a horseshoe nail pinning a two-
               inch square snip of calico to the bottom of the sheet. He 
               reads the letter with the habitual difficulty of a man unused 
               to words and then he turns the letter, removes the nail and 
               looks at the snip of cloth.

               She comes to him, her arms piled with clothing; and

               Laurie a step behind her, holding up a new pair of long-
               handled underwear -- measuring it with her eyes for holes, 
               etc.

               He holds out the snip of calico.

               He takes the calico snip, places it within the letter and 
               carefully pockets it. He looks broodingly into the fire.

               Laurie's face is troubled as she turns from him and heads 
               for the grandmother room, carrying the armful of clothes.

               He takes the letter out of his pocket -- as though he meant 
               to read it -- and then he puts it back decisively.

               He starts to undress. Martin lies back on his bunk.

               Martin throws himself back, turns his face to the wall.

               Ethan looks soberly at him -- and is sorry for the brutality 
               of his words.

               It is a still scene, with the first light of day in the sky, 
               a thin plume of smoke rising from the chimney.

               She is in a robe made of an Indian blanket, belted snugly 
               around her waist. She wears moccasins for slippers. Her 
               flannel nightgown is high at the collar and almost trails 
               the floor. She is at the stove, frying bacon and eggs; a 
               coffee pot is on the boil. Beyond her the door to the 
               grandmother room opens and Martin comes in -- dressed in 
               Brad's clothes. His eyes whip around the room. Laurie doesn't 
               turn as he slowly approaches.

                         Ethan rode on... an hour ago.

               The starch goes out of him. He walks heavily to the table 
               and sits, slumped. She looks at him compassionately.

               He just shakes his head, not looking at her. She lifts the 
               food from the skillet onto a plate and sets it before him.

               He shakes his head. She crosses to the stove for the coffee 
               pot.

                         her.

               Now it is her turn to stare.

                         ...I've seen him take his knife an' 
                         ...never mind... But he's a man can

                         be there to stop him, if such thing 
                         come.

               Laurie has poured his coffee. Now he sips it. She sits at 
               the table with him.

               She takes Ethan's letter from her breast and hands it to 
               him. He takes it, puzzled, and slowly reads it aloud.

               He runs out and she slams the door, then rests her head

               Mrs. Jorgensen quietly enters the room and sees Laurie with 
               head pressed against the door. She wants to offer some word 
               of sympathy, but doesn't know what to say. She crosses to 
               the stove to pour herself a cup of coffee. Then we hear the 
               drum of horses' hooves, the sound of Martin riding away.  
               Laurie flings open the door, almost as though to call him 
               back.

               ANGLING from behind Laurie in the doorway as Martin, riding 
               one horse, leading another, goes galloping away.

<b>               EXT. FUTTERMAN'S TRADING POST - WIDE ANGLE - DAY

               Low, squat adobe structure, with a crudely lettered sign-
               board proclaiming it:

               There are adjacent outbuildings and corral. Four horses are 
               tied outside, two being pack animals. A surly-looking white 
               man or breed sits in a stool tilted back near the door, 
               whittling with a long-bladed knife, eyeing the horses 
               covetously. He glances aside and glares as a squaw shuffles 
               along bearing a clumsy load of faggots on her bowed back.

               Fearfully she quickens her step. The man gets up, shoves 
               knife into belt and heads into the post.

<b>               INT. FUTTERMAN'S TRADING POST - FULL SHOT - DAY

               It is a grimy establishment with some dusty trade goods on 
               shelves; a counter which serves as a bar; a few plank tables 
               and benches.

               The breed seen outside enters and crosses to a side table 
               where another mean-looking hombre sits preparing to play a 
               game of solitaire with a deck of limp cards.

               Ethan and Martin are at a table in the center of the room, 
               examining a dirty, rumpled child's dress -- Debbie's.

               Martin nods soberly in answer to Ethan's inquiring look; 
               yes, it's hers. Both look up as FUTTERMAN crosses from the 
               bar, carrying a whisky jug and two dirty glasses -- his 
               fingers thrust inside the glasses. Futterman is a squaw man 
               and a killer -- dead eyes in a white face.

               He sets the jug down, picks up one of the glasses -- so grey 
               and thumb-printed it is almost opaque. Both Ethan and Martin 
               regard it with disgust. Futterman gives a slight shrug, takes 
               the dress and starts to wipe the dirty glass with it. Martin 
               snatches it out of his hand.

               He tilts the jug to his mouth as Ethan reaches for his heavy 
               leather pouch. Futterman watches greedily as Ethan lets a 
               gold piece slide out. He tosses it onto the table.

               Futterman puts the jug down. His hand inches -- as though 
               pulled by a magnet -- toward the gold piece.

               Ethan stands. Martin follows. Martin takes the dress and

               They leave. The CAMERA holds on Futterman as he slowly rubs 
               his bruised hand. His henchmen drift toward him.

               They have set up camp near a cluster of cottonwoods to which 
               the horses have been tied. One of the horses is restless, 
               possibly nickering. Ethan strokes its neck, looking out 
               thoughtfully into the night -- listening.

<b>                                     MARTIN'S VOICE

                         Smells a change in the weather...

               CAMERA PANS him to where Martin is spreading his blanket 
               some little distance from the small fire.

<b>                                     ETHAN
</b>                         Wouldn't surprise me if we didn't

                              (he picks up a saddle 
                              and puts it close to 
                              fire)
                         Whyn't you bed down closer to the 
                         fire, boy?

               Martin is a bit surprised as Ethan takes the blanket and 
               spreads it near the saddle -- making the saddle serve as a 
               pillow. Then Ethan tosses a few more heavy pieces of dry 
               wood on the fire, making it blaze up.

<b>                                     MARTIN

                         my bones is cold tonight...

               He spreads his own blanket as Martin wraps into his bedroll, 
               and when Martin turns, he casually arranges the blanket to 
               suggest it is over the figure of a man. During this:

                         mention of any Nawyecky Comanche 
                         there...

               Ethan steps back -- and studies the "dummy."

</b>                         What's that?

               Ethan studies Martin's back -- the light on him -- and looks 
               around figuring the range of fire.

</b>                         Sorta like 'roundabout' -- like a 
                         man says he's goin' one place when 
                         he means to go just the reverse...

               Martin just grunts and snugs deeper into his blanket. Ethan 
               nods his satisfaction -- sure Martin isn't going to change 
               positions. Then he takes off his hat and boots and uses them 
               to complete the dummy. He picks up his rifle then and quietly 
               walks out of the camp.

               Three shadowy figures -- Futterman and his two henchmen -- 
               are quietly dismounting, taking rifles from saddle scabbards.

               At a hand signal from Futterman, they quietly fan out afoot.

<b>               EXT. NIGHT CAMP - MED. CLOSE SHOT - MARTIN
</b>
               still snug in his blankets, sound asleep; the fire burning a 
               little lower but still shedding plenty of light on him.

<b>               EXT. HILLY COUNTRY - FULL SHOT - FROM BEHIND FUTTERMAN AND 
</b><b>               HIS HENCHMEN
</b>
               At a crouch or crawling, the three worm their way among some 
               rocks until they reach a slight rise looking down into the 
               camp. Martin is asleep and next to him is Ethan's dummy, hat 
               over its face, and the fire still burning. The two henchmen 
               snake their rifles up to a firing position. A shot cracks... 
               and one man is knocked flat on his face.

               The other whirls in the direction of the shot, his rifle 
               swinging in search of a target. A second shot splits the 
               night and the breed falls as though hit by a giant fist...

               Martin is sitting up now, staring wildly around. Futterman 
               starts to run down-slope, away from the hidden marksman, 
               dodging between the rocks. A third shot catches him in the 
               back and he spins and falls and rolls down the slope into 
               the firepit camp area. Martin is on his feet now.

<b>               EXT. NIGHT CAMP - FULL SHOT - MARTIN
</b>
               He is staring at Futterman, face down and almost at his feet. 
               He looks around in fear at someone approaching -- hand going 
               to his gun. Then he relaxes as Ethan casually enters the 
               camp, bareheaded, carrying his rifle.

               Ethan kneels beside Futterman, turns him over, reaches into 
               his pockets -- first one, then another.

                              through pockets)
                         Whatchu doin'?...

               Ethan grins satisfiedly as he straightens and spins the gold 
               piece in the air, catches it and pockets it.

                         We did all right.

               And now Martin is getting the whole picture... and he's mad.

               Ethan is just grinning at him -- completely unruffled, denying 
               none of it.

               Ethan sobers a little, seems honestly surprised.

               It is a day in early winter. Charlie MacCorry, short-coated, 
               is galloping across the yard as Jorgensen crosses it -- 
               carrying a load of firewood.

               cold.

               he isn't going to read the letter. Laurie has been sneaking

               Ethan is ceremoniously pinning something on the stern-faced 
               buck. It is one of the rosettes seen in the shoebox.

               CAMERA MOVES to an extreme CLOSEUP of the rosette. On it, in 
               gold letters, is:

               to split his face -- bends to pick up a huge bundle of furs.

               "LOOK" is somewhat under five feet tall, pigeon-toed, platter-
               faced and wide-eyed. Over her arm is a very handsome blanket. 
               She is coming forward shyly toward Martin, propelled by a 
               Comanche -- her father. Martin, with an armful of trade goods -- 
               a few yards of bright calico, a couple of AGED SOW rosettes 
               and some trinkets -- is indicating the blanket. Look glances 
               shyly at her father.

               He shakes his head negatively. Look is disappointed.

               The father points to Martin's pile of trade goods. Martin 
               bends and picks up the indicated object: it is a battered 
               high-crowned beaver hat. The Indian grunts his approval and 
               puts it on. Look looks relieved. Martin reaches for the 
               blanket. Look takes a quick step backward and holds up one 
               finger: wait! Then she runs back through the other Comanches 
               now crowding forward.

               The name registers with some of the nearer braves. There is 
               a quick interchange of glances, frowning, hostile.

               He breaks and both turn as Look rides over the hill on a 
               little spotted Indian pony, with her squaw-bag slung up behind 
               her and her blanket over the saddle. She closes the gap

               Look smiles and sets her horse in motion as Ethan moves ahead. 
               Martin's face is a mask of comic despair as he gives up. He 
               is mouthing the words --

               And Ethan suddenly breaks into song; to the tune of "Skip To 
               My Lou:"

               Ethan is wrapped in his blanket roll, head propped by an 
               elbow, grinning sardonically as he watches a strange ritual 
               in the camp. The score is softly reprising "Skip to my Lou."

               Look is standing with her blanket folded over one arm, her 
               head shyly downcast, not far from where Martin (back to her) 
               is spreading his own bed roll. He sits on it then and begins 
               pulling off his boots. He is very conscious of Ethan's 
               watchful scrutiny. Finally he is ready. He lies back on his 
               blanket. At once Look is at his side to spread her own 
               blanket. Martin sits bolt upright and tugs his blanket free 
               and wraps it protectively around him. She stares at him, 
               puzzled.

               She nods her understanding, hurries off to fetch a canteen.

               Martin glares at Ethan.

               Look returns with the canteen, hands it to Martin and kneels 
               beside him. He looks at her sympathetically.

               Now she jabbers in Comanche and, at the appropriate time, 
               will point to the sky and imitate a bird flying.

               She nods and smiles and quickly settles alongside him and 
               spreads her blanket over them both. Martin recoils, plants 
               his foot in the small of her back and sends her sprawling.

               Ethan busts a gut laughing. Martin jumps to his feet, angrily.

                         ask her where Scar is?

               Ethan stares at the girl. Her face is suddenly impassive as 
               she looks from Martin to the ground.

               He gets to his feet and he crosses to stand before her. So 
               does Martin.

               face, she bends swiftly, picks up her blanket and walks away 
               from them to choose her own sleeping place. The two men don't 
               know what to make of it.

               It is the same scene the following morning. The men are 
               standing above where Look had bedded for the night, looking 
               at the ground. Clearly marked on the hard ground is a crudely 
               drawn arrow.

                         off where the arrow points.

               He walks toward their horses, starts to saddle up.

               And Ethan starts singing "Skip to My Lou" half under his 
               breath. Martin gives him a sour side-glance and continues 
               saddling.

               Ethan turns. Now faintly, little more than a shred of sound, 
               is the distant blowing of a bugle.

<b>                                     MARTIN

                         that a bugle... and firing?

               Ethan stares -- and then the bugle sound repeats and the 
               distant crack of shots, from long miles off.

               And the two break and run for their horses.

                         men was away -- huntin' maybe... So

               Ethan has dismounted in front of one of the tepees, heads 
               inside.

               as Ethan enters. A body -- Look's -- is sprawled on the

               Ethan, who has turned indifferently to leave, pauses.

               Martin shows him what Look had been clutching -- Debbie's 
               rag doll.

               Ethan snatches it, stares at it. Then he turns and runs from 
               the tepee. Martin stares at Look's body, then covers it with 
               a robe.

               stonily along the line of passing prisoners.

               The column of cavalry and prisoners enters the agency 
               (COLORADO FOOTAGE). We see the dead and wounded on travois; 
               the agency Indians watching stoically; the prisoners -- some 
               of them -- being herded into a chapel.

<b>               INT. OFFICE OF NOKONI AGENCY - FULL SHOT - DAY

               The office has been set up as a temporary army headquarters. 
               The GENERAL is being interviewed by two Eastern newspaper 
               CORRESPONDENTS. At a table beyond is a telegrapher, sending 
               out a report of the victory.

               A pot-bellied stove supplies heat and the General is warming 
               his hands at it, intermittently. An adjutant is rather wearily 
               filling out a long official form.

               The General, for all his mudded boots remains a beau sabreur 
               and is loosely modeled upon a certain other well-known glory 
               hunter of the Indian wars. He wears a colonel's straps, but 
               insists upon his brevet rank.

               The door is opened by a guard and Ethan takes a step into 
               the room -- then stops in manifest shock. Martin

               is at his heels, eager and expectant. Beyond them stands 
               Keefer, grave and compassionate. There is a keening sound in 
               the room -- almost an animal sound.

<b>               INT. THE CHAPEL - REVERSE SHOT - FULL
</b>
               It is a simple log-sided room with plank benches without 
               backs. Up front is a small box-like pulpit, no altar.

               Across the front of the room, set up either on benches or on 
               boards over saw-horses are four blanket-covered figures -- 
               at least two being the bodies of children.

               Squatting on the floor near them is an elderly white woman 
               with hair hanging loosely down her back and clad in Indian 
               robes. Standing, facing the newcomers, is a woman who may be 
               no more than in her mid-thirties.

               She is mad -- wild-eyed, frightened, with matted, unbrushed 
               golden hair, torn garments. It is she who has been making 
               the keening sound, the animal moans. Now she crouches at the 
               sight of them and looks desperately for a means of escape. 
               Two girls are asleep, heads together and backs to the door. 
               One has light hair, like Debbie's; the other brown hair. The 
               afternoon sun coming through a high window touches the light 
               hair.

               He has seen the light hair and starts crossing the room.

               Now the madwoman begins her screaming, running from side to 
               side like a trapped animal. Ethan follows Martin into the 
               room, Keefer behind him. Martin comes to a stop, realizing 
               the woman is afraid of him. The two sleeping girls stir, but 
               do not turn.

</b>                         Don't be scared, ma'am...

               The madwoman crouches behind one of the benches, looking at 
               them with frightened eyes.

</b>                         Just don't pay any attention to her...

               Martin swallows and nods and crosses to the light-haired 
               girl. He reaches a hand gingerly to touch her shoulder.

                         Debbie?

               At the touch, the girl is on her feet, crouching -- one hand, 
               like a claw, drawn back to rake his face. She is unmistakably 
               a white girl, but she is painted like a Comanche woman --her 
               ears red inside, streaks of paint accenting the savagery of 
               her face. Her eyes are frightened, yet full of hate.

                         The other girl has risen almost in 
                         the same instant -- but more out of 
                         fear. She is younger, but painted 
                         like the other. She moves to stand 
                         behind the savage one.

               Martin stares at him, then realizes what he has in mind.

               He fishes the rag doll from under his coat and holds it out 
               to the girl. She looks at it... and we may almost suspect it 
               is rekindling a memory -- but then she spits at it. The other 
               girl laughs. Martin turns away and he's sick.

               Ethan and Keefer move away. As they do, the madwoman -- eyes 
               fixed on the rag doll in Martin's hand -- begins creeping up 
               behind him. Martin is torturedly watching Ethan and Keefer 
               as first one blanket then another is raised -- we will never 
               see the dead. During this:

               Martin relaxes... and in that instant the madwoman has the 
               doll in her hands. She cradles it and she croons.

               Martin reaches to take it away. But she calmly sits, cradling 
               the doll, and rocks to and fro, humming a lullaby. He can't 
               take it. Ethan returns.

</b>
               Laurie has reached the last page of the letter, reading it 
               by the lamp on the table. Jorgensen is knocking out the dead 
               ashes of his pipe.  Charlie is in the shadows, a guitar in 
               his hands -- not playing it, but occasionally softly picking 
               a note or chord. Mrs. Jorgensen is dabbing moist eyes with a 
               corner of her apron.

                         again this year...

               She swallows hard, pauses a moment in her reading.

</b>                         Well, I just thought it would be a 
                         sin and a shame not to let SOMEONE 
                         get some good of it...

               She looks almost too obviously at Charlie, which annoys 
               Laurie. Laurie resumes her letter reading:

                         looks like 'I wish' or 'I will'...
                              (she gives up)

               That's all there is. Not a cross on it. Laurie just looks at 
               it. Jorgensen stands, pocketing his pipe, easing the crick 
               in his back. He ceremoniously removes the spectacles and 
               replaces them on the mantel.

               She heads for the front door.

                              without conviction)
                         Now, Laurie!...

               Charlie hits the guitar a little stronger. Mrs. Jorgensen 
               looks at him -- and the matchmaker is at work.

               Mrs. Jorgensen smiles and moves about her duties. Laurie has 
               opened the door and is staring out wistfully... and Charlie 
               begins playing and singing a verse from "Skip to My Lou."

               The search theme is heard again as the two riders, with single

               It is hot country.

               Their faces are sun-tanned, burned dark and dry. Gone are 
               the heavy coats and clothing of their northern days. They do 
               not speak, just ride -- and there is the same bleak, fanatic, 
               hard look about them both. The music theme segues into

               It is a small place -- a single dirt street, a few adobe 
               houses; a few racks of dried meat; a burro with a load of 
               faggots on its back being driven along by a small boy; the 
               music coming from a little cantina in the middle of the 
               street. Before the cantina is a bone rack of a horse, without 
               a saddle -- only a blanket pad. There is something familiar 
               about the horse and Ethan is staring at it as they ride in.

               The two men dismount, beating dust out of their clothes.

               Ethan takes another look at the sorry old nag tied outside.

               Martin pauses beside Ethan.

               as Ethan and Martin enter. It is a dirt-floored room with a 
               small bar near the door, chairs and benches along the walls. 
               A pair of guitar players are at the far end of the room. A 
               couple of Mexicans are playing a noisy game of dominoes, 
               slapping the dominoes down hard... EMILIO FIGUEROA, back to 
               the door, spurred boots across one of the tables, is sipping 
               a drink. Emilio is a cynical, middle-aged, aristocratic-
               looking man in modified charro costume. Watching the domino 
               game is ESTRELLA, lithe, sensuous, smoking a brown-paper 
               cigarette; she is barefoot. Behind the bar is the proprietor, 
               dozing on his stool. Ethan takes a step into the room.

               The proprietor awakens. The domino game is suspended in mid-
               play. Estrella turns... and from beside Emilio, previously 
               obscured by the man's back and the big charro hat, pokes the 
               head of old Mose. Emilio turns then to look at the newcomers.

               He is on his feet and advancing to meet them. As he recognizes 
               them a wide, foolish grin splits his face and his mouth opens 
               and closes in words that won't come out. He grabs and shakes 
               Ethan's arm, then Martin's.

               She is giving him an appraising once-over, then signals the 
               musicians to play. She rests her buttocks against a table 
               and waits, her eyes challenging Martin to make a move. Emilio 
               is watching Estrella and Martin with something akin to bored 
               amusement.

               Ethan has poured a drink for Mose, now one for himself --
               leaving Martin's glass empty.

               He angrily throws a coin on the counter, appropriates the

               Neither Ethan nor Mose seems aware of his going.

               Ethan stares at him. Mose nods his reaffirmation of it.

               Then Ethan's hand locks on the old man's shoulder.

               Mose winces under the grip. He can't speak, but he looks 
               past Ethan and he points. Ethan turns. Emilio swings his 
               boots off the table and slowly crosses to them. He lets 
               cigarette smoke curl out of his mouth. Then he smiles.

               As the men study each other, Estrella begins her dance --  
               and the rhythmic click of the castanets will beat like a 
               metronome. Emilio looks at the bottle on the bar, disdainfully 
               pushes it away and imperiously signals the proprietor to 
               bring something better.

               He is knocking off his tequila and looking at the girl 
               hungrily. She is doing her swaying dance, playing up to him 
               and with unmistakable effect. He sloshes another drink into 
               his glass and, never taking his eyes off her, downs it.

               Beyond Estrella we see Ethan, Emilio, and Mose at the bar --
               gestures, headshakes, the entire pantomime of an inaudible 
               conversation. Then Ethan takes out his pouch and begins 
               dropping gold pieces into Emilio's hand. Meanwhile, dance 
               and dancer are achieving their purpose with Martin. And the 
               tequila is working. He gets to his feet, a little groggily. 
               Estrella's smile deepens and there is a clear invitation in 
               her eyes... Ethan turns then, his deal with Emilio concluded, 
               and he sees what is going on. He starts for Martin's table 
               just as Martin moves out to take the girl.

               Martin tries to push him away, his eyes still on the girl.

               and lets her arms slide around his neck.

               of rock: majestic, savage country. At the head of the column 
               ride Ethan, Emilio, and Martin. Behind them come Emilio's 
               cargadores -- lean, hard-bitten wiry little Mexicans. One

               They are turning a bend and now, ahead, we see a cordon of 
               Comanches -- all armed, all quiet, all very menacing as they 
               watch the approaching column. Emilio calls a greeting in 
               Comanche. It gets no answer.

               One tepee stands apart from the other's -- Scar's. Beyond it 
               are other tepees, the gathering of braves and some squaws, 
               the drying racks for meat, etc. Emilio leads the way toward 
               the central tepee. They dismount nearby and Emilio inclines 
               his head toward the one tepee. Ethan and Martin brace 
               themselves and wait. The flap of the tepee is closed.

               The flap is thrust aside and SCAR steps out -- the same 
               Comanche we had seen at the grave when Debbie was captured.

               He stands tall, arrogant, eyeing the white men with hard, 
               implacable eyes. He has a robe gathered about him. Across 
               his face is a scar.

               The white men's eyes are as hard as the Comanche's: this is 
               the man they have long sought, the killer, the raper.

               But he makes no direct answer. He looks instead to Emilio.

               Scar looks at it greedily, then nods. He'll accept it.

               He looks at Ethan. Again that faintly contemptuous smile.

               He signals them to enter his tepee.

               He follows Ethan into the tepee... and a worried Emilio goes 
               along.

<b>               INT. THE TEPEE - FULL SHOT
</b>
               A small fire burns in the center of the lodge and a shaft of 
               sunlight strikes in from the smoke flap at the peak.

               Two chunky squaws, who have been tending the fire or grinding 
               corn in a rock pestle, scuttle to a side of the tepee. Two 
               others, one half-grown and the other slightly taller, sit 
               with their backs to the fire, huddled over some leather work 
               or stitching. Both are shawled. As Scar enters, he barks a 
               word to the squaws near the fire.

                              (then he turns to the

               He sits on some robes, signs for them to sit opposite.

               Slowly they look around them.

               They are sitting with heads averted, slightly profiled -- 
               but clearly Indian women, broad-faced, dark of hair and skin.

<b>                                     EMILIO'S VOICE

               One of the squaws turns -- and even in the shadows we see it 
               is another Indian face. The other does not turn.

               Scar leans in, blocking the view.

                         Mayah-kay zee-eh!...
                              (Bring the lance!)

               The slightly smaller of the young squaws stiffens but doesn't 
               move. Scar glares.

               The girl gets to her feet. Ethan and Martin watch as, still 
               with averted face, she crosses to where a lance hangs from 
               the tepee wall. It has several scalps on it, including one 
               with light red hair. Slowly she carries it back. Scar never 
               takes his eyes from the faces of the white men, savoring 
               every moment of it. The girl extends the lance between them, 
               so that it is like a bare blade separating two duelists. 
               Neither Ethan nor Martin dares at first look at more than 
               the scalp pole... Then slowly their eyes lift... and the 
               CAMERA MOVES IN and RAISES TO:

<b>               INT. THE TEPEE - EXTREME CLOSE SHOT - DEBBIE
</b>
               As the shawl slips back to reveal her light hair, the slant 
               green eyes looking at them from a tanned, but still white 
               and very beautiful face. (NOTE TO MUSIC: The SEARCH THEME 
               should cover all the foregoing action -- but at the first 
               clear view of DEBBIE, it ends dramatically.)

               Debbie's eyes hold theirs -- and then Scar's voice is heard:

<b>                                     SCAR

                              (Go!)

               Swiftly she straightens, takes away the scalp pole and goes 
               back to her former place.

<b>               INT. THE TEPEE - MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE GROUP AS BEFORE
</b>
               Scar is watching the white men like a hawk. Martin's eyes 
               are wide and his breathing seems suspended. But Ethan is 
               playing it like a poker player.

                         I've seen scalps before...

               Scar's eyes are mocking. He lets his robe slip back from his 
               shoulders, revealing a bare bronzed chest on which -- glinting 
               in the reflected firelight -- is the medallion that Ethan 
               had given Debbie. It is suspended by a chain or rawhide 
               string. Scar touches it.

<b>                                     SCAR
</b>                         This before?

               Ethan smiles -- and he's still playing poker. He stands...  
               and the others follow. Scar is puzzled.

<b>                                     ETHAN
</b>                              (to Emilio)

                         to pitch camp across the crick... 
                         Maybe we can talk trade tomorrow.

               Scar hasn't understood all of it. He scowls and looks at 
               Emilio.

               Scar looks at Ethan and at Martin. He smiles slightly, and 
               he nods his agreement.

</b>                         Puetze!

               Martin and Ethan turn to go. Only then does Debbie look 
               swiftly at them and as swiftly away. Martin can't help but 
               pause, but Ethan prods him toward the tepee flap.

<b>               EXT. THE TEPEE - MED. CLOSE SHOT - MOVING - THE THREE MEN
</b>
               They emerge from the tepee and begin to walk away -- not 
               fast, not slow, and without a side glance. Scar emerges and 
               looks after them -- glowering. A few other Comanches begin 
               to gather near his tepee.

               They reach the waiting cargadores and the pack train, 
               surrounded by suspicious Comanches.

               He fumbles for a pouch, holds it out to Ethan.

               He digs spurs and rides out. Ethan turns and looks soberly 
               at Martin. We hear the rest of the riders moving away.

               Ethan and Martin cross the sand and go down slope toward the 
               creek where their horses are waiting.

               He moves quickly then to put himself between Ethan and the 
               girl and in that instant there is the crack of a rifle.

               Ethan is hit in the leg. It goes out from under him. Martin 
               swings and his gun is out and firing.

               A mounted Comanche is on the crest of the dune above them --
               rifle raised. Martin's first shot brings him down the dune 
               in a spectacular horse-and-man fall. Debbie goes running 
               like a deer up the creek, away from Martin; in the same

               from the far left. Martin turns to see Debbie running away.

               as Ethan and Martin race their horses from the creek area

               Ethan is swaying in his saddle, just barely hanging on, as 
               Martin races up behind him -- driving Ethan's horse along.

               They swing past a huge outcrop of rock and go tearing along 
               a vaulting wall of stone. Their hoofbeats and those of the 
               pursuers bounce and echo off the canyon walls, and bullets 
               whine and ricochet.

               Ethan is lurching almost out of the saddle, barely conscious.

               Martin spots the cave -- ahead -- and drives his mount and

               Ethan turns and sees what he means. He starts dragging himself 
               to the cave as Martin grabs the rifles from their saddle 
               scabbards, yanks off the water canteens and then drives their

               their horses running off -- pursued by some yelling Comanches. 
               Four or six others come into sight, heading for the cave -- 
               moving cautiously, uncertainly -- not seeing their quarry. 
               Then the white men open fire and the Comanches bend low over

               Ethan is lying on the hard earth, perhaps cushioned with 
               some boughs. He is half delirious. A small fire is burning.

               Martin enters carrying the canteens. He looks 
               unsympathetically toward Ethan, then continues to the fire, 
               takes a knife and starts to sterilize it. Ethan gasps, mumbles 
               and then a word comes clear.

               Martin stares at him -- and now, perhaps for the first time, 
               he is fitting pieces into the jig-saw puzzle. He shifts closer 
               to Ethan and we see he is preparing to dig out the bullet.

               Jorgensen is at the door boisterously welcoming some new 
               arrivals. Leading them into the room is Captain the Reverend 
               Sam Clayton, with a bulky oil-skin package under his arm. 
               With him is Charlie MacCorry, dressed in his best black suit

               Horses, wagons fill the yard. We can hear the lively music 
               of the square dance. As Jorgensen opens the door and sets 
               out toward the barn, a battered dusty trap drives in -- and 
               on it are Martin and Ethan. Jorgensen at first doesn't 
               recognize them.

               as he enters, with Jorgensen at his heels. For a moment, as 
               he stands there, the party breezes on. Then first one, then 
               another sees him. They gape, and the music falters and stops. 
               Sam Clayton crosses to confront him across the width of the 
               room. Jorgensen tries to be the easy, smiling host--and makes 
               a very bad job of it.

               Mrs. Jorgensen throws herself against his chest, sobbing.

               Ethan looks past her at Clayton. And the faces of both men 
               are grim.

               The room is dark. Martin is pacing, eyes constantly turning 
               to the inside door. And then it opens and Laurie is inside, 
               holding a lamp. She is in her bridal gown and very obviously 
               trying to keep from betraying the stress she is under.

               He just stares at her -- very lovely, strangely remote.

               He suddenly is conscious of his dirty hands, his dusty, worn 
               clothing.

               She begins to cry, very softly. He is beside her and his arm 
               goes around her shoulder comfortingly.

               Martin swings wildly but Charlie is a wily fighter. He side-
               steps and chops Martin in the jaw and drives him against the 
               wall. Laurie runs between them.

               Martin nods and unbuckles his gunbelt. The men head outside 
               as Laurie runs to get help.

               Charlie waits assuredly as Martin follows him outside.

               Martin makes a wild run, swings. The blow is neatly guarded 
               by Charlie's left and countered with a crisp right that puts 
               Martin down. Martin gets to his feet, more cautiously this 
               time, and comes in at a crouch; he's fighting like an Indian, 
               not a white man. The men from the wedding party come out now 
               at a run.

               Charlie turns slightly and in that instant Martin springs 
               and drives a straight right at his face -- almost as though 
               there were a knife in the hand. MacCorry stumbles back into 
               Clayton's arms.

</b>                         In that case, give the boys room...

               Martin waits at a crouch as Charlie comes in, feints his 
               right and crosses his left. It is a hard blow but Martin 
               recovers and waits... Charlie circles and starts to repeat. 
               He feints his right but this time Martin springs in, ducks 
               and -- as the left shoots out -- he grabs the wrist and throws 
               Charlie over his head. What we are looking at, in effect, is 
               a wrestler against a boxer.

               Charlie is on his feet and warily starts circling -- now 
               trying to imitate Martin's crouch. Suddenly Martin feints a 
               right swing and connects with a solid left -- reversing the 
               order of business. Charlie staggers and Martin follows up 
               with a wrestling hold, leaping behind Charlie, locking both 
               legs around him and driving his arms upward behind his back 
               so that his face is in the dirt and so he could -- under

               With the hands locked, Martin then calmly draws a knife. He 
               looks innocently into the aghast faces of the crowd.

                         count coup!

               With that he releases the paralyzed arms just long enough to 
               grab a lock of Charlie's hair and neatly snip it off.

               He stands then and laughs as Charlie lamely gets to his feet -- 
               easing the tortured arms. Clayton goes to Charlie's side. 
               Laurie moves to Martin's side.

               Charlie frowns and looks off at where Laurie and Martin are 
               standing.

               assembly, murmurous with surprise.

<b>               INT. JORGENSEN KEEPING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
</b>
               The last of the wedding guests is leaving: Ed Nesby carrying 
               his bull fiddle and with his wife and daughter and two smaller 
               children preceding him out the door.

               The Jorgensens stand by -- trying to put a good face on the 
               wedding debacle. Charlie MacCorry is sitting dejectedly, 
               studying a spot on the floor. Ethan is at the mantel. Laurie 
               is in her room -- presumably changing out of her wedding 
               gown. Martin is at a sink, bathing a cut on his lip. Clayton, 
               still in his clerical coat, is near the door.

               Mrs. Jorgensen puts her handkerchief to her eyes -- letting 
               down now that the guests have gone. Jorgensen crosses to 
               her, pats her sympathetically.

                         prior to his demise.

               Ethan casually reaches into his pocket, takes out a gold 
               coin and spins it.

               Fast hoofbeats sound o.s. -- signalling the approach of a

               A voice hails from outside.

               Clayton stands in the opened doorway, Jorgensen behind him, 
               looking out. Drawn up outside is the four-man cavalry detail, 
               led by a young and very crisp LIEUTENANT. We may or may not 
               see the sixth man, slouched over his horse. The Lieutenant 
               swings off and crosses.

               The Lieutenant gapes at Clayton's ministerial coat.

               Ethan chuckles, to Clayton's very obvious annoyance.

               A file of eighteen men and horses -- Rangers -- is walking 
               under the shoulder of a mesa, keeping well below the skyline.

               They pass CAMERA one by one -- Sam Clayton in the lead, Martin 
               behind him leading two horses, then the others -- grim-
               looking, capable men of varying ages; some with long drooping 
               mustaches, some in need of shaves, some chawing tobacco.

               He is lying prone, his hat off, squinting down into a long 
               reach of desert canyon at the Comanche encampment -- with 
               tepees set up, a thin wisp of smoke rising from a fire, the 
               horse herd penned in a draw cut off by an improvised corral 
               of rawhide ropes.

               The camp is sleeping. A dog yaps shrilly. One of the tepee 
               flaps opens and Scar steps out. He picks up a stone or a 
               chunk of wood and throws it. The dog yelps and runs off. 
               Scar's air is troubled, suspicious. He heads for the horse 
               herd. The camp sleeps on.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT - ETHAN - AT RIM OF A MESA - DAWN LIGHT

               His face betrays a bitter inner satisfaction. He looks back 
               along the trail as faintly we hear the approach of the Ranger 
               company. Then he squirms back, retrieving his hat.

<b>               FULL SHOT - HEAD OF RANGER COLUMN - DAWN LIGHT

               Sam, seeing Ethan in the near distance, raises his hand in a

               join him. He takes the reins of his horse from Martin.

               hold his and there is no doubting the truth in them.

               Ethan looks long and hard at Martin, then reaches into his 
               shirt for the folded, dirty, dog-eared paper that was his 
               will. Slowly he tears it into shreds.

               up as Charlie MacCorry comes over, an Indian blanket in his 
               hands. He tosses it onto Martin's shoulder.

               Then he grins and extends his hand. Martin takes it -- and 
               they shake as Charlie pulls him to his feet. Martin drops 
               his hat, and then -- at a crouching run -- he heads for the 
               distant Comanche camp.

</b>                         Yes, sir...

               He whips out his sabre -- to the imminent peril of Captain 
               Sam who quickly shifts out of the way.

</b>                         Watch that knife, boy!

               Then Sam continues away and the Rangers after him.

<b>               EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF COMANCHE CAMP - FULL SHOT - DAWN LIGHT
</b>
               Martin runs from behind CAMERA and dodges behind a rock. The 
               camp is still asleep, very quiet. Martin runs out from behind 
               the rock and makes another short dash toward the camp, 
               dropping behind a pile of blankets or other impedimenta. A 
               dog runs out of one of the tepees, begins barking.

<b>               EXT. THE HORSE HERD - MED. CLOSE SHOT - SCAR
</b>
               He stands with another Comanche -- inspecting the horse lines. 
               In the near distance the dog's barking is heard -- shrill, 
               insistent. Scar, almost like an animal, sniffs the air 
               suspiciously. The other Comanche laughs.

<b>                                     COMANCHE

                              (A rabbit.)

               Scar isn't satisfied but returns to his work.

</b><b>               MARTIN
</b>
               He is staring at it -- remembering it from certain distinct 
               decorations. The lower part of the tepee is rolled up, for 
               better air circulation. Martin wraps Charlie's blanket around 
               him and begins walking to the tepee.

<b>               EXT. THE LEE OF THE HOGBACK OR RISE - FULL SHOT - THE 
</b><b>               RANGERS
</b>
               The line is drawn up, dismounted, the men checking their 
               sidearms, tightening cinches, etc. Sam moves briskly along 
               the line of men, then mounts his horse.

               The last comes as Greenhill tries to mount, simultaneously 
               flailing out his sabre perilously close to Clayton.

<b>               EXT. SCAR'S TEPEE - MED. CLOSE SHOT - MARTIN
</b>
               Martin has gained the tepee, takes one quick look around, 
               then strides in.

<b>               INT. SCAR'S TEPEE
</b>
               as Martin enters. One robe, tossed back, shows where Scar 
               has slept. Against one wall lie the huddled figures of two 
               squaws. Two other figures -- one being Debbie's -- sleep in 
               robes. Martin's eyes go to Scar's place and then rove slowly 
               and hold on:

<b>               INT. TEPEE - MED. CLOSE SHOT - DEBBIE
</b>
               She moves slightly so that the light strikes her fair hair. 
               Martin kneels close to her and gently touches her shoulder, 
               to awaken her. Her eyes open, then widen in fear. Martin 
               quickly claps a hand over his mouth.

               Silently she fights him, trying to pull the hand away.

<b>                                     MARTIN
</b>                              (a hoarse whisper)
                         Debbie... don't!

               And then her fingernails rake his hand. He winces and lets 
               go. She screams and tries to leap up. He grabs her. The other 
               squaws wake -- begin squawking.

<b>                                     MARTIN

                         or not...

               Debbie sees something beyond him. Her eyes widen.

<b>                                     DEBBIE
</b>                              (a scream)

<b>               INT. TEPEE - SHOOTING FROM EXTREME LOW ANGLE, AS FROM HER 
</b><b>               P.O.V. - SCAR
</b>
               He looms in the flap of the tepee much as he had over the 
               grave when he first kidnapped her. He has a scalping knife 
               in his hand. Scar whips his arm back. Behind him we see the 
               other Comanche -- the one from the horse herd.

<b>               INT. TEPEE - FULL SHOT
</b>
               Martin spins and his gun is out. He fans the trigger hammer 
               twice -- and both slugs hit Scar. As the other Comanche leaps 
               in, Martin's gun speaks again. And then he is on his feet, 
               catching Debbie by the arm -- unresisting now -- and pulling 
               her after him through the camp. Shouts and cries bespeak the 
               awakening of the camp.

<b>               EXT. THE HOGBACK - FULL SHOT - THE RANGER GROUP
</b>
               They are mounted and in line. The echo of a shot comes 
               bouncing back. Clayton is facing the men. He solemnly doffs 
               his hat and bows his head.

<b>                                     CLAYTON
</b>                         For these Thy gifts which we are 
                         about to receive...
                              (donning his hat, he 
                              turns to the bugler)
                         Sound that horn, son, and Leave Us 
                         Go Amongst Them...YA-HEE!

               And shouting the rebel yell, he leads the charge. The yell 
               is picked up by every man and the bugler sounds the charge 
               as though he had a regiment at his back. Lt. Greenhill -- a 
               West Point beau sabreur in strange company -- has his sabre 
               at the "charge."

<b>               FULL MOVING SHOT - ON THE CHARGE
</b>
               In the swamp of men and horses, we just have time to notice 
               that Sam is darting a somewhat worried look at Greenhill's 
               saber ominously close to his back. The charge is sounding, 
               the hooves are drumming and the men are yelling the way they 
               did when they rode with Bedford Forrest -- reins in their 
               teeth, guns in their fists.

<b>               EXT. THE ENCAMPMENT - FULL SHOT - AS THE RANGERS HIT
</b>
               Comanches are running from the tepees, trying to reach their 
               horse herd as the file of Rangers knifes in.  The bark of 
               hand guns is a steady sound now -- and the Comanches have 
               never been up against such marksmen. One charging Ranger 
               rides down a tepee. Another, with two guns drawn, scores a 
               running double on two Indians racing toward him from opposite 
               sides of his fast-running horse. A dodging Comanche screams 
               as a barrel-chested roan hits him broadside and sends him 
               sprawling into the embers of the campfire.

<b>               EXT. SCAR'S TEPEE - FULL SHOT - ETHAN
</b>
               He yanks his horse back to its haunches, firing at a Comanche 
               crouched near the tepee. The charge races past him. Ethan 
               swings off and runs to the tepee flap, whips it open and 
               glares. A squaw comes running out at him, knife upraised, 
               but he knocks her sprawling with a full arm sweep. He turns 
               and his face is a mask of frustration -- and then he freezes, 
               seeing what he has been looking for:

<b>               EXT. THE INDIAN ENCAMPMENT - LONG SHOT - ETHAN'S P.O.V.
</b>
               Martin is running with Debbie, trying to pull her along, 
               while she kicks and claws and tries to break free. (They are 
               about thirty yards from the camp proper.) Riderless horses 
               are milling, circling. O.s. we can hear the firing, the yells.

<b>               EXT. SCAR'S TEPEE - FULL SHOT
</b>
               Ethan remounts and heads around the side of Scar's tepee.

               In the distance we see Martin and Debbie. The Rangers, 
               regrouping, are charging back through the camp, driving the 
               Comanche horse herd.

<b>               EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - MED. CLOSE SHOT - MARTIN AND DEBBIE
</b>
               Martin hears Ethan's horse riding down at them; he turns, 
               and Debbie pulls free and starts to run away.

<b>                                     MARTIN
</b>                         No, Ethan! NO!

               He goes running into the path of Ethan's horse.

<b>               EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - MOVING SHOT - ETHAN
</b>
               as Martin runs and grabs hold of his stirrup, trying to fight 
               the horse to a stop. Ethan swings on him -- once, twice -- 
               and Martin is knocked sprawling. Ethan rides on, relentlessly.

<b>               EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - FULL SHOT - DEBBIE AND ETHAN
</b>
               She is running and dodging, trying to escape the horseman.

               Ethan has his gun drawn. She ducks to one side and the horse 
               goes past. Both figures are almost obscured in the dust. 
               Ethan spins his mount and charges after her. She runs and 
               then falls -- and he is off his horse and striding toward 
               her.

<b>               EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - ETHAN AND DEBBIE
</b>
               Ethan is at the left of CAMERA and slightly closer to the 
               foreground, with Debbie at the right, supine on the ground 
               and the dust swirling around her. Ethan draws and raises his 
               gun. The hammer goes back.

<b>                                     ETHAN
</b>                              (quietly)
                         I'm sorry, girl... Shut your eyes...

               The dust clears. The CAMERA MOVES slightly forward along the 
               gun arm and HOLDS on Debbie's face -- the eyes gazing 
               fearlessly, innocently into Ethan's. We HOLD for a long moment 
               and then the gun lowers. Ethan slowly holsters it and walks 
               over to her.

<b>               EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - CLOSE SHOT - ETHAN
</b>
               He looks down at her.

<b>                                     ETHAN
</b>                              (softly)
                         You sure favor your mother...

<b>               EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO
</b>
               He extends his hand to her. She takes it and he helps her to 
               her feet. And then she is against his chest and his arm goes 
               protectingly about her. They are standing that way when Martin 
               stumbles up -- and stares.

<b>               EXT. COMANCHE CAMP - WIDE ANGLE - DAY
</b>
               The line of Rangers is afoot now, each man near his horse, 
               each man with rifle out, pumping shot after shot at the 
               fleeting remnant of Comanches riding down the long valley 
               with their scattered horse herd milling and criss-crossing 
               in mid-ground... And then as the firing slackens, from afar 
               we can hear the blare of a cavalry bugle sounding the charge: 
               sign of the approach of Greenhill's troop.

</b>
               It is perhaps half an hour later. Clayton is very grim of 
               face and occasionally wincing. His trousers are down over 
               his ankles, his shirt-tails flapping over his long-handled 
               red underwear. Behind him Charlie MacCorry is kneeling, 
               applying some crude first aid to Sam's rump. Beyond them 
               some of the Rangers are readying for the move-out. Sam looks 
               up angrily as COLONEL GREENHILL, a guidon bearer, and bugler 
               ride in. Greenhill is a choleric man.

<b>                                     COLONEL

                         What is it, Sergeant -- a bullet or 
                         an arrow?

               Charlie just gapes, but Clayton -- grim-lipped -- bends a 
               meaningful glare on someone off. Greenhill looks that way.

<b>               EXT. THE INDIAN ENCAMPMENT - CLOSE SHOT - LT. GREENHILL
</b>
               He is standing with his sabre at salute -- looking as 
               miserable as any shavetail would look when in disgrace. It 
               could be that the end of the sabre has a pronounced bend.

<b>               EXT. THE INDIAN ENCAMPMENT - FULL SHOT - THE GROUP
</b>
               Sam suddenly slaps MacCorry's hand away and grabs for his 
               pants and pulls them up -- and around a tepee come three 
               figures -- Ethan, Debbie, and Martin -- with Ethan holding 
               Debbie's hand. And Sam's face is split by a grin as he tucks 
               his shirt-tails in and goes to meet them.

               He is in a rocker on the porch. Suddenly he stares out and 
               stops rocking. Faint in the distance, but coming closer, the 
               clop-clop of two horses, moving at a walk. A moment later 
               Jorgensen emerges and comes to stand beside Mose, shading 
               his eyes and squinting against the sun, still not recognizing 
               the distant horsemen.  He is joined by Mrs. Jorgensen. And 
               then Laurie comes out and she too stares, frowning at first, 
               then with dawning realization.

               Lars and Mrs. Jorgensen also begin to guess... to suspect...  
               and then to know. And Laurie starts to run.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT - MOVING WITH LAURIE

               The CAMERA MOVES ahead of her as she runs blindly over the 
               hard-packed ground, running as hard as she can toward the 
               still unseen but nearing horsemen.

<b>               FULL SHOT - THE GROUP

               Ethan has Debbie on the pommel of his saddle, his arm 
               supporting her, and she is asleep. Martin is riding beside 
               them. Laurie comes running up to stare at Ethan and at the 
               girl. He smiles and puts a finger to his lips -- cautioning 
               her against waking Debbie -- and then he rides by. Laurie 
               looks then at Martin. He doesn't know whether to smile or 
               not; he just waits. And then she is beside him and she steps 
               onto his stirruped foot and vaults up beside him, and she 
               kisses him just as she had on the day he left the graves to 
               take up the search. And still holding her beside him, he 
               rides slowly after Ethan and Debbie toward the house.
