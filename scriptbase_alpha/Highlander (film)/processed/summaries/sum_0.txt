Born in the Highlands of Scotland in 1518, Connor Macleod is immortal.
When he is wounded in battle but does not die, he is banished from his village.
He meets another like himself, Ramirez, who teaches him swordsmanship--the only way to kill another immortal is to take his head--and the ways of the immortals.
Modern-day New York is the location of "The Gathering," where Connor and the few remaining immortals must battle to the last for "The Prize."
