Dante has had a crummy job at an small convenience store since graduating from high school three years ago.
While still enamored of his high school sweetheart Caitlin, he now has a serious relationship with long-suffering Veronica, who wants him to quit his job and begin college.
His best friend Randall, who runs the next-door video store, is even less dedicated to his job than Dante.
The movie covers one eventful day at the job.
