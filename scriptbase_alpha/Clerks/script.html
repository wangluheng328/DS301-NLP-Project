				"Clerks."

				Kevin Smith




<b>	INT: BEDROOM. EARLY-MORNING HOURS
</b>
	A DOG sleeps on a neatly made bed.

	A CLOCK reads twenty to six.

	A SHELF OF BOOKS holds such classics as Dante's Inferno,
	Beyond Good and Evil, The Catcher in the Rye, and The Dark
	Knight Returns. A FRAMED DIPLOMA, dusty and unkempt, hangs
	askew on the wall. A snapshot of a girl is stuck in the
	corner, and a bra weighs one end down. A PHONE sits quietly
	atop a bundle of laundry. It suddenly explodes with a
	resounding ring-once, twice, three times. A CLOSET DOOR
	swings open, and a half-clad figure falls out. THE PHONE
	rings yet again, and a hand falls upon the receiver, yanking
	it off the trash can, O.C. THE RUMPLED FIGURE lays with his
	back to the camera, phone in hand.

<b>				FIGURE
</b>			(groggily)
		Hello...What?...No, I don't work
		today...I'm playing hockey at two.

	THE DOG yawns and shakes its head.

<b>				FIGURE (O.C.)
</b>		Why don't you call Randal?...
		Because I'm fucking tired....I just
		closed last night....
			(deep sigh)
		Jesus...What time are you going to
		come in?...Twelve...Be there be
		twelve?...Swear...

	A PICTURE OF A GIRL leans against a trophy. The picture is
	decorated with a Play-Doh beard and mustache.

<b>				FIGURE (O.C.)
</b>		Swear you'll be in by twelve and
		I'll do it....Twelve...Twelve or I
		walk.

	THE PHONE RECEIVER slams into the cradle. THE RUMPLED FIGURE
	slowly sits up and remains motionless. He musses his hair
	and stands.

	THE DOG stands and wags its tail. A hand pats its head. The
	Rumpled Figure lays down on the bed. We now see his face. It
	is the face of DANTE and this is Dante's room; this is
	Dante's life. DANTE grabs the dog and wrestles it.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Next time, I get the bed.

<b>										2.
</b>

	He releases the dog and sits up.

<b>				DANTE
</b>			(exhausted)
		Shit.

<b>						CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT: BATHROOM. MINUTES LATER
</b>
	A steaming shower fills the room. The dog licks water from
	the toilet.

<b>						CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT: KITCHEN. MINUTES LATER
</b>
	A towel-dressed DANTE opens the fridge and peers inside. He
	grabs a half-empty gallon of milk and closes the door.

<b>						CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT: KITCHEN. SECONDS LATER
</b>
	Chocolate milk mix is heaped into a tumbler. One scoop, two
	scoops, three scoops, four scoops.

<b>						CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT: BEDROOM. A MINUTE LATER
</b>
	DANTE gulps his breakfast while feeling inside the closet
	for some clothes. Some chocolate milk spills on the floor.
	THE DOG laps at the small puddle of chocolate milk.

<b>						CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT: HALLWAY. MINUTES LATER
</b>
	DANTE'S feet are hastily covered. A hand grabs keys from
	atop a VCR.

<b>						CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	EXT: DRIVEWAY. MINUTES LATER
</b>
	A car backs out of the driveway and speeds down the street.

<b>						CUT TO:
</b>
<b>										3.
</b>

<b>	EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING
</b>
	The car pulls up, with a screech. Feet descend to the ground
	from the open door. Keys jam into a lock and pop it open.

<b>						CUT TO:
</b>
	DANTE lifts the metal shutter revealing the door. He opens
	it and grabs two bundles of papers, throwing them inside the
	store.

<b>						CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING
</b>
	A very dark room barely lit by the daylight. Suddenly, the
	lights flick on, revealing the glorious interior of the
	convenience store. THE CAT looks at DANTE as he passes the
	camera quickly. THE PAPER BUNDLE is snapped open with a
	knife. Newspapers slam into the appropriate racks. One rack
	remains empty. A coffee filter is placed in a metal pot.
	Ground coffee follows, and the mix is shoved into place in
	the coffeemaker. The switch is flicked and the machine comes
	to life. The empty newspaper rack with the heading ASBURY
	PARK PRESS seems out of place among all the other stacks of
	papers. DANTE rubs his chin and stares, puzzled. He rolls
	his eyes as it occurs to him.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Shit.

	The register pops open, and a hand extracts a quarter.

<b>						CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING
</b>
<b>	POV: NEWSPAPER MACHINE
</b>
	Through murky glass and thin metal grating, we see DANTE
	approach. He stops and drops a quarter in the slot. He pulls
	the door down, finally allowing us a clear view as he
	reaches toward the camera.

	DANTE pulls a stack of newspapers from the Asbury Park Press
	vending machine. He struggles to hold them all in one hand
	as he lets the door slam shut. He turns to walk away, but
	the sound of the quarter dropping into the change slot stops
	him. He takes a step back to grab the coin.

<b>						CUT TO:
</b>
<b>										4.
</b>

<b>	INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING
</b>
	The papers drop into the once-empty rack with a resounding
	flop. The quarter drops back into the register drawer.

<b>						CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING
</b>
	DANTE tries to jam the key into the window shutter lock. He
	looks down at it.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Shit!

	The lock is gummed up with gum or something hard and
	obtrusive like gum, preventing the key from being inserted.
	DANTE looks around and kicks the shutter angrily. The car
	trunk pops open and a hand reaches inside, pulling out a
	folded white sheet.

<b>						CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING
</b>
	A can of shoe polish is grabbed from the shelf. DANTE dips
	his fingers into the shoe polish and writes large letters on
	the unfurled sheet, leaning on the cooler.

<b>						CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING
</b>
	DANTE stands on a garbage can and tucks a corner of the
	sheet under the awning. He jumps down. The banner reads I
	ASSURE YOU, WE'RE OPEN. The door sign shifts from CLOSED to
<b>	OPEN.
</b>
<b>						CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING
</b>
	The clock reads 6:20. DANTE leans behind the counter, the
	morning routine completed. He stares ahead, catatonic, then
	drops his head in his hands. The day has begun.

<b>						CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY
</b>
	The store, with its makeshift banner looming in the dim
	morning hour, just after dawn. A car drives by.

<b>						CUT TO:
</b>
<b>										5.
</b>

<b>	INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY
</b>
	DANTE waits on a customer (ACTIVIST) buying coffee.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Thanks. Have a good one.

<b>				ACTIVIST
</b>		Do you mind if I drink this here?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Sure. Go ahead.

	The ACTIVIST leans on a briefcase and drinks his coffee.
	Another CUSTOMER leans in the door.

<b>				CUSTOMER
</b>		Are you open?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Yeah.

<b>				CUSTOMER
</b>		Pack of cigarettes.

<b>				ACTIVIST
</b>		Are you sure?

<b>				CUSTOMER
</b>		Am I sure?

<b>				ACTIVIST
</b>		Are you sure?

<b>				CUSTOMER
</b>		Am I sure about what?

<b>				ACTIVIST
</b>		Do you really want to buy those
		cigarettes?

<b>				CUSTOMER
</b>		Are you serious?

<b>				ACTIVIST
</b>		How long have you been smoking?

<b>				CUSTOMER
</b>			(to DANTE)
		What is this, a poll?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Beats me.

<b>										6.
</b>

<b>				ACTIVIST
</b>		How long have you been a smoker?

<b>				CUSTOMER
</b>		Since I was thirteen.

	The ACTIVIST lifts his briefcase onto the counter. He opens
	it and extracts a sickly-looking lung model.

<b>				ACTIVIST
</b>		I'd say you're about nineteen,
		twenty, am I right?

<b>				CUSTOMER
</b>		What the hell is that?

<b>				ACTIVIST
</b>		That's your lung. By this time,
		your lung looks like this.

<b>				CUSTOMER
</b>		You're shittin' me.

<b>				ACTIVIST
</b>		You think I'm shitting you...

	The ACTIVIST hands him something from the briefcase.

<b>				CUSTOMER
</b>		What's this?

<b>				ACTIVIST
</b>		It's a trach ring. It's what they
		install in your throat when throat
		cancer takes your voice box. This
		one came out of a sixty-year-old man.

<b>				CUSTOMER
</b>			(drops ring)
		Unnhh!

<b>				ACTIVIST
</b>			(picks up the ring)
		He smoked until the day he died.
		Used to put the cigarette in this
		thing and smoke it that way.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Excuse me, but...

<b>										7.
</b>

<b>				ACTIVIST
</b>		This is where you're heading. A
		cruddy lung, smoking through a hole
		in your throat. Do you really want
		that?

<b>				CUSTOMER
</b>		Well, if it's already too late...

<b>				ACTIVIST
</b>		It's never too late. Give those
		cigarettes back now, and buy some
		gum instead.
			(grabs nearby pack, reads)
		Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.

<b>				CUSTOMER
</b>		It's not the same.

<b>				ACTIVIST
</b>		It's cheaper than cigarettes. And
		it certainly beats this.

	Hands him a picture.

<b>				CUSTOMER
</b>		Jesus!

<b>				ACTIVIST
</b>		It's a picture of a cancer-ridden
		lung. Keep it.

<b>				CUSTOMER
</b>			(to DANTE)
		I'll just take the gum.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Fifty-five.

<b>				ACTIVIST
</b>		You've made a wise choice. Keep up
		the good work.

	The CUSTOMER exits.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Maybe you should take that coffee
		outside.

<b>				ACTIVIST
</b>		No, I think I'll drink it in here,
		thanks.

<b>										8.
</b>

<b>				DANTE
</b>		If you're going to drink it in
		here, I'd appreciate it if you'd
		not bother the customers.

<b>				ACTIVIST
</b>		Okay. I'm sorry about that.

	Another CUSTOMER comes up to the counter.

<b>				CUSTOMER
</b>		Pack of cigarettes.
			(looks at model)
		What's that?

<b>				ACTIVIST
</b>		This? How long have you been smoking?

	A blank wall. JAY steps into the frame, followed by SILENT
	BOB. JAY pulls off his coat and swings it into the arms of
	SILENT BOB. JAY then throws down with a makeshift slam
	dance, spinning his arm and fake-hitting SILENT BOB.

<b>				JAY
</b><b>		WE NEED SOME TITS AND ASS! YEAH!
</b>
	SILENT BOB lights a smoke.

<b>				JAY
</b>		I feel good today, Silent Bob.
		We're gonna make some money! And
		then you know what we're going to
		do? We're going to go to that party
		and get some pussy! I'm gonna fuck
		this bitch, that bitch...
			(Blue Velvet Hopper)
<b>		I'LL FUCK ANYTHING THAT MOVES!
</b>
	SILENT BOB points to something off-screen.

<b>				JAY
</b>			(to O.C.)
		What you looking at?! I'll kick
		your fucking ass!
			(to SILENT BOB)
		Doesn't that motherfucker still owe
		me ten bucks?

	SILENT BOB nods.

<b>										9.
</b>

<b>				JAY
</b>		Tonight, you and me are going off
		that fucker's head, and take out
		his fucking soul! Remind me if he
		tries to buy something from us, to
		cut it with leafs and twigs...or
		fucking shit in the motherfucker's
		bag!

	Some girls walk past. JAY smiles at them.

<b>				JAY
</b>		Wa sup sluts?
			(to SILENT BOB)
		Damn Silent Bob! You one rude
		motherfucker! But you're cute as
		hell.
			(slowly drops to knees)
		I wanna go down on you, and suckle
		you.
			(makes blow job neck-jerks)
		And then, I wanna line up three
		more guys, and make like a circus
		seal...

	JAY makes blow job faces down an imaginary line of guys,
	looking quite like a performing seal. He throws a little
	humming sound behind each nod. He then hops up quickly.

<b>				JAY
</b>		Ewwww!  You fucking faggot! I
		fucking hate guys!
			(yelling)
<b>		I LOVE WOMEN!
</b>			(calmer)
		Neh.

	A GUY comes up to them.

<b>				GUY
</b>		You selling?

<b>				JAY
</b>			(all business)
		I got hits, hash, weed, and later
		on I'll have 'shrooms. We take
		cash, or stolen MasterCard and Visa.

	A SMALL CROWD gathers around the ACTIVIST as he orates. It
	has become something of a rally.

<b>									10.
</b>

<b>				ACTIVIST
</b>		You're spending what? Twenty,
		thirty dollars a week on cigarettes.

<b>				LISTENER 1
</b>		Forty.

<b>				LISTENER 2
</b>		Fifty-three.

<b>				ACTIVIST
</b>		Fifty-three dollars. Would you pay
		someone that much money every week
		to kill you? Because that's what
		you're doing now, by paying for the
		so-called privilege to smoke!

<b>				LISTENER 3
</b>		We all gotta go sometime...

<b>				ACTIVIST
</b>		It's that kind of mentality that
		allows this cancer-producing
		industry to thrive. Of course we're
		all going to die someday, but do we
		have to pay for it? Do we have to
		actually throw hard-earned dollars
		on a counter and say, "Please,
		please, Mister Merchant of Death,
		sir; please sell me something that
		will give me bad breath, stink up
		my clothes, and fry my lungs."

<b>				LISTENER 1
</b>		It's not that easy to quit.

<b>				ACTIVIST
</b>		Of course it's not; not when you
		have people like this mindless
		cretin so happy and willing to sell
		you nails for your coffin!

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Hey, now wait a sec...

<b>				ACTIVIST
</b>		Now he's going to launch into his
		rap about how he's just doing his
		job; following orders.
<b>				(MORE)
</b>
<b>									11.
</b>

<b>				ACTIVIST (CONT'D)
</b>		Friends, let me tell you about
		another bunch of hate mongers that
		were just following orders: they
		were called Nazis, and they
		practically wiped a nation of
		people from the Earth...just like
		cigarettes are doing now! Cigarette
		smoking is the new Holocaust, and
		those that partake in the practice
		of smoking or sell the wares that
		promote it are the Nazis of the
		nineties! He doesn't care how many
		people die from it! He smiles as
		you pay for your cancer sticks and
		says, "Have a nice day."

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I think you'd better leave now.

<b>				ACTIVIST
</b>		You want me to leave? Why? Because
		somebody is telling it like it is?
		Somebody's giving these fine people
		a wake-up call?!

<b>				DANTE
</b>		You're loitering in here, and
		causing a disturbance.

<b>				ACTIVIST
</b>		You're the disturbance, pal! And
		here...
			(slaps a dollar on
			the counter)
		I'm buying some...what's
		this?...Chewlie's Gum. There. I'm
		no longer loitering. I'm a customer,
		a customer engaged in a discussion
		with other customers.

<b>				LISTENER 2
</b>			(to DANTE)
		Yeah, now shut up so he can speak!

<b>				ACTIVIST
</b>		Oh, he's scared now! He sees the
		threat we present! He smells the
		changes coming, and the loss of
		sales when the nonsmokers finally
		demand satisfaction. We demand the
		right to breathe cleaner air!

<b>									12.
</b>

<b>				LISTENER 3
</b>		Yeah!

<b>				ACTIVIST
</b>		We'd rather chew our gum than
		embrace slow death! Let's abolish
		this heinous practice of sucking
		poison, and if it means ruffling
		the feathers of a convenience store
		idiot, then so be it!

<b>				DANTE
</b>		That's it, everybody out.

<b>				ACTIVIST
</b>		We're not moving! We have a right,
		a constitutional right, to assemble
		and be heard!

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Yeah, but not in here.

<b>				ACTIVIST
</b>		What better place than this? To
		stamp it out, you gotta start at
		the source!

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Like I'm responsible for all the
		smokers!

<b>				ACTIVIST
</b>		The ones in this town, yes! You
		encourage their growth, their habit.
		You're the source in this area, and
		we're going to shut you down for
		good! For good, cancer-merchant!

	The small crowd begins to chant and jeer in DANTE's face.

<b>				CROWD
</b>		Cancer merchant! Cancer merchant!
		Cancer merchant!

	VERONICA enters and surveys the mess. The CROWD throws
	cigarettes at DANTE, pelting him in the face. Suddenly, a
	loud blast is heard, and white powder explodes over the
	throng. Everyone turns to face...

	VERONICA as she stands in one of the freezer cases, holding
	a fire extinguisher.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		Who's leading this mob?

<b>									13.
</b>

	The CROWD looks among themselves. Someone points to O.C.

<b>				SOMEONE
</b>		That guy.

	The ACTIVIST carries his briefcase surreptitiously toward
	the door.

<b>				VERONICA (O.C.)
</b>		Freeze.

	VERONICA jumps off the freezer case, training the nozzle of
	the extinguisher on the ACTIVIST.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		Let's see some credentials.

	He reaches into his briefcase. She pokes the extinguisher
	nozzle at him, warningly.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		Slowly...

	He pulls out a business card and hands it to her. She reads
	it.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		You're a Chewlie's Gum
		representative?

	He nods.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		And you're stirring up all this
		antismoking sentiment
		to...what?...sell more gum?

	He nods again.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>			(through gritted teeth)
		Get out of here.

	He quickly flees. She blasts him with more chemical as he
	exits.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>			(to the crowd)
		And you people: Don't you have jobs
		to go to? Get out of here and go
		commute.

	The CROWD sheepishly exits, one by one, offering apologetic
	glances. DANTE tries to regain his composure.

<b>									14.
</b>

	VERONICA watches the crowd disperse, disgusted.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		You oughta be ashamed of yourselves.
		Easily led automatons. Try thinking
		for yourself before you pelt and
		innocent man with cigarettes.

	The last of the crowd exits. VERONICA sets the fire
	extinguisher down next to DANTE. DANTE is sitting on the
	floor, head in his folded arms.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		It looked like Tiananmen Square in
		here for a second.

	DANTE is silent.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		"Thank you, Veronica; you saved me
		from an extremely ugly mob scene."

	DANTE remains silent.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>			(sits beside him)
		Okay, champ. What's wrong?

	DANTE lifts his head and shoots her a disgusted look.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		All right, stupid question. But
		don't you think you're taking this
		a bit too hard?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Too hard?! I don't have enough
		indignities in my life-people start
		throwing cigarettes at me!

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		At least they weren't lit.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I hate this fucking place.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		Then quit. You should be going to
		school anyway...

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Please, Veronica. Last thing I need
		is a lecture at this point.

<b>									15.
</b>

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		All I'm saying is that if you're
		unhappy you should leave.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I'm not even supposed to be here
		today!

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		I know. I stopped by your house and
		your mom said you left at like six
		or something.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		The guy got sick and couldn't come
		in.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		Don't you have a hockey game at two?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Yes! And I'm going to play like
		shit because I didn't get a good
		night's sleep!

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		Why did you agree to come in then?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I'm only here until twelve, then
		I'm gone. The boss is coming in.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		Why don't you open the shutters and
		get some sunlight in here?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Somebody jammed the locks with gum.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		You're kidding.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Bunch of savages in this town.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		You look bushed. What time did you
		get to bed?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I don't know-like two-thirty, three.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		What were you doing up so late?

<b>									16.
</b>

<b>				DANTE
</b>			(skirting)
		Hunhh? Nothing.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>			(persistent)
		What were you doing?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with
		you now?

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		Who's fighting? Why are you so
		defensive?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Who's defensive? Just...Would you
		just hug me?! All right? Your
		boyfriend was accosted by an angry
		mob, and he needs to be hugged.

	She stares at him.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		What? What is that?

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		She called you, didn't she?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Oh, be real! Would you...Would you
		please hug me? I just went through
		a very traumatic experience and I
		haven't been having the best day so
		far. Now come on.

	VERONICA stares at him.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		What? What's with that look?! I
		wasn't talking to anyone, especially
		her! Look at you, being all sort
		of...I don't know...stand-offish.

	VERONICA looks away.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Fine. You don't trust me, don't hug
		me. I see how it is. All right
		Pissy-pants, you just go on being
		suspicious and quiet. I don't even
		want to hug you at this point.

<b>									17.
</b>

	VERONICA looks back at him.

<b>				DANTE
</b>			(pleadingly)
		Give you a dollar?

<b>						CUT TO:

	A NOTE on the counter next to a small pile of money reads:

<b>	PLEASE LEAVE MONEY ON THE COUNTER. TAKE CHANGE WHEN
</b><b>	APPLICABLE. BE HONEST.
</b>
	DANTE and VERONICA are slumped on the floor, behind the
	counter. VERONICA holds DANTE in her arms, his head on her
	chest. Change is heard hitting the counter.

<b>				DANTE
</b>			(to O.C. customer)
		Thanks.

	The door is heard opening and closing-a customer leaving.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		How much money did you leave up
		there?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Like three dollars in mixed change
		and a couple of singles. People
		only get the paper of coffee this
		time of morning.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		You're trusting.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Why do you say that?

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		How do you know they're taking the
		right amount of change? Or even
		paying for what they take?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Theoretically, people see money on
		the counter and nobody around, they
		think they're being watched.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		Honesty through paranoia. Why do
		you smell like shoe polish?

<b>									18.
</b>

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I had to use shoe polish to make
		that sign. The smell won't come off.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		Do you think anyone can see us down
		here?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Why? You wanna have sex or something?

<b>				VERONICA
</b>			(sarcastic)
		Ooh! Can we?!

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Really?

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		I was kidding.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Yeah, right. You can't get enough
		of me.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		Typically male point of view.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		How do you figure?

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		You show some bedroom proficiency,
		and you think you're gods. What
		about what we do for you?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Women? Women, as lovers, are all
		basically the same: they just have
		to be there.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		"Be there?"

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Making a male climax is not all
		that challenging: insert somewhere
		close and preferably moist; thrust;
		repeat.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		How flattering.

<b>									19.
</b>

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Now, making a woman cum...therein
		lies a challenge.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		Oh, you think so?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		A girl makes a guy cum, it's
		standard. A guy makes a girl cum,
		it's talent.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		And I actually date you?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Something wrong?

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan,
		it takes more than that to get a
		guy off. Just "being there"-as you
		put it-is not enough.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I touched a nerve.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		I'm astonished to hear you
		trivialize my role in our sex life.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		It wasn't directed at you. I was
		making a broad generalization.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		You were making a generalization
		about "broads!"

<b>				DANTE
</b>		These are my opinions based on my
		experiences with the few women who
		were good enough to sleep with me.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		How many?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		How many what?

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		How many girls have you slept with?

<b>									20.
</b>

<b>				DANTE
</b>		How many different girls? Didn't we
		already have this discussion once?

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		We might have; I don't remember.
		How many?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Including you?

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		It better be up to and including me.

<b>				DANTE
</b>			(pause to count)
		Twelve.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		You've slept with twelve different
		girls?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Including you; yes.

	Pause. She slaps him.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		What the hell was that for?

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		You're a pig.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Why'd you hit me?

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		Do you know how many different men
		I've had sex with?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Do I get to hit you after you tell
		me?

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		Three.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Three?

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		Three including you.

<b>									21.
</b>

<b>				DANTE
</b>		You've only had sex with three
		different people?

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		I'm not the pig you are.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Who?

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		You!

<b>				DANTE
</b>		No; who were the three, besides me?

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.

<b>				DANTE
</b>			(with true admiration)
		Wow. That's great. That's something
		to be proud of.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		I am. And that's why you should
		feel like a pig. You men make me
		sick. You'll sleep with anything
		that says yes.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Animal, vegetable, or mineral.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		Vegetable meaning paraplegic.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		They put up the least amount of
		struggle.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		After dropping a bombshell like
		that, you owe me. Big.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		All right. Name it.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		I want you to come with me on Monday.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Where?

<b>									22.
</b>

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		To school. There's a seminar about
		getting back into a scholastic
		program after a lapse in enrollment.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Can't we ever have a discussion
		without that coming up?

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		It's important to me, Dante. You
		have so much potential that just
		goes to waste in this pit. I wish
		you'd go back to school.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Jesus, would you stop? You make my
		head hurt when you talk about this.

	VERONICA stands, letting DANTE'S head hit the floor.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Shit! Why are we getting up?

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		Unlike you, I have a class in
		forty-five minutes.

	A handsome young man (WILLAM) is standing at the counter.
	VERONICA reacts to him.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>			(surprised)
		Willam!

<b>				WILLAM
</b>		Ronnie! How are you? You work here
		now?

<b>				VERONICA
</b>			(locks arms with DANTE)
		No, I'm just visiting my man.
			(to DANTE)
		Dante, this is Willam Black.
			(to WILLAM)
		This is Dante Hicks, my boyfriend.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		How are you? Just the soda?

<b>				WILLAM
</b>		And a pack of cigarettes.
			(to VERONICA; paying)
		Are you still going to Seton Hall?

<b>									23.
</b>

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		No, I transferred into Monmouth
		this year. I was tired of missing
		him.
			(squeezes DANTE'S arm)


<b>				WILLAM
</b>		Do you still talk to Sylvan?

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		I just talked to her on Monday. We
		still hang out on weekends.

<b>				WILLAM
</b>			(leaving)
		That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds
		take it easy, all right?

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		I will. Take it easy.

<b>				WILLAM
</b>		Bye.
			(exits)


<b>				VERONICA
</b>		Bye
			(to DANTE)
		That was Snowball.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Why do you call him that?

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job
		thing.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		What do you mean?

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		After he gets a blow job, he likes
		to have the cum spit back into his
		mouth while kissing. It's called
		snowballing.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		He requested this?

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		He gets off on it.

<b>									24.
</b>

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Sylvan can be talked into anything.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		Why do you say that?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Like you said-she snowballed him.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Yeah, right.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		I'm serious...

	A moment of silence as DANTE'S chuckles fade to comprehension.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		You sucked that guy's dick?

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		Yeah. How do you think I know he
		liked...

<b>				DANTE
</b>			(panicky)
		But...but you said you only had sex
		with three guys! You never mentioned
		him!

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		That's because I never had sex with
		him!

<b>				DANTE
</b>		You sucked his dick!

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		We went out a few times. We didn't
		have sex, but we fooled around.

<b>				DANTE
</b>			(massive panic attack)
		Oh my God! Why did you tell me you
		only slept with three guys?

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		Because I did only sleep with three
		guys! That doesn't mean I didn't
		just go with people.

<b>									25.
</b>

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you
		understood.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I did understand! I understand that
		you slept with three different
		guys, and that's all you said.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		Please calm down.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		How many?

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		Dante...

<b>				DANTE
</b>		How many dicks have you sucked?!

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		Let it go...

<b>				DANTE
</b><b>		HOW MANY?
</b>
<b>				VERONICA
</b>		All right! Shut up a second and
		I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't
		freak like this when you told me
		how many girls you fucked.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		This is different. This is important.
		How many?!

	She counts silently, using fingers as marks. DANTE waits on
	a customer in the interim. VERONICA stops counting.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Well...?

<b>				VERONICA
</b>			(half-mumbled)
		Something like thirty-six.

<b>				DANTE
</b><b>		WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
</b>
<b>									26.
</b>

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		Lower your voice!

<b>				DANTE
</b>		What the hell is that anyway,
		"something like thirty-six?" Does
		that include me?

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		Um. Thirty-seven.

<b>				DANTE
</b><b>		I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?
</b>
<b>				VERONICA
</b>			(walking away)
		I'm going to class.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Thirty-seven?!
			(to CUSTOMER)
		My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven
		dicks!

<b>				CUSTOMER
</b>		In a row?

	DANTE chases VERONICA down and grabs her by the door.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Hey! Where are you going?!

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		Hey listen, jerk! Until today you
		never even knew how many guys I'd
		slept with, because you never even
		asked. And then you act all
		nonchalant about fucking twelve
		different girls. Well, I never had
		sex with twelve different guys!

<b>				DANTE
</b>		No, but you sucked enough dick!

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		Yeah, I went down on a few guys...

<b>				DANTE
</b>		A few?

<b>									27.
</b>

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		...And one of those guys was you!
		The last one, I might add, which-if
		you're too stupid to comprehend-
		means that I've been faithful to
		you since we met! All the other
		guys I went with before I met you,
		so, if you want to have a complex
		about it, go ahead! But don't look
		at me like I'm the town whore,
		because you were plenty busy
		yourself, before you met me!

<b>				DANTE
</b>			(a bit more rational)
		Well...why did you have to suck
		their dicks? Why didn't you just
		sleep with them, like any decent
		person?!

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		Because going down it's a big deal!
		I used to like a guy, we'd make
		out, and sooner or later I'd go
		down on him. But I only had sex
		with the guys I loved.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I feel sick.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>			(holds him)
		I love you. Don't feel sick.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Every time I kiss you now I'm going
		to taste thirty-six other guys.

	VERONICA violently lets go of him.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		I'm going to school. Maybe later
		you'll be a bit more rational.

<b>				DANTE
</b>			(pause)
		Thirty-seven. I just can't...

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		Goodbye, Dante.

	She exits in a huff. DANTE stands there in silence for a
	moment. Then he swings the door open and yells out.

<b>									28.
</b>

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Try not to suck any more dicks on
		your way through the parking lot!

	Two men who were walking in the opposite direction outside
	double back and head in the direction. VERONICA went.

	The VERY ANXIOUS CUSTOMER now sits on the ground, next to

	the key into the lock. The VERY ANXIOUS CUSTOMER stares as
	RANDAL enters the store. The door closes behind him, only to
	be held ajar in a gentlemanly fashion a few moments later.
	RANDAL smiles.

</b>		One fight a day with Veronica is

<b>				RANDAL

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I guess it's not really fighting.
		She just wants me to leave here, go

<b>				RANDAL

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Seven months.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Chick's nuts about you. How long
		did you date Caitlin?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Five years.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Chick only made you nuts. She
		cheated on you how many times?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Eight and a half.

<b>									35.
</b>

<b>				RANDAL
</b>			(looks up from paper)
		Eight and a half?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Party at John K's-senior year. I
		get blitzed and pass out in his
		bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives
		all over me.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		That's cheating?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		In the middle of it, she calls me
		Brad.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		She called you Brad?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		She called me Brad.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		That's not cheating. People say
		crazy shit during sex. One time, I
		called this girl "Mom."

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I hit the lights and she freaks.
		Turns out she thought I was Brad
		Michaelson.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		What do you mean?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		She was supposed to meet Brad
		Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked
		the wrong one. She had no idea I
		was even at the party.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Oh, my God.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Great story, isn't it?

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		That girl was vile to you.

<b>									36.
</b>

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Interesting postscript to that
		story: Do you know who wound up
		going with Brad Michaelson in the
		other dark bedroom?

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Your mother.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Allan Harris.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Chess team Allan Harris?!

<b>				DANTE
</b>		The two moved to Idaho together
		after graduation. They raise sheep.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		That's frightening.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		It takes different strokes to move
		the world.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		In light of this lurid tale, I
		don't see how you could even
		romanticize your relationship with
		Caitlin-she broke your heart and
		inadvertently drove men to deviant
		lifestyles.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Because there was a lot of good in
		our relationship.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Oh yeah.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I'm serious. Aside from the
		cheating, we were a great couple.
		That's what high school's all
		about-algebra, bad lunch, and
		infidelity.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		You think things would be any
		different now?

<b>									37.
</b>

<b>				DANTE
</b>		They are. When she calls me now,
		she's a different person-she's
		frightened and vulnerable. She's
		about to finish college and enter
		the real world. That's got to be
		scary for anyone.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>			(suddenly recalling)
		Oh shit, I've got to place an order.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I'm talking to myself here.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		No, no, I'm listening. She's
		leaving college, and...?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		...and she's looking to me for
		support. And I think that this is
		leading our relationship to a new
		level.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		What about Veronica?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I think the arguments Veronica and
		I are having are some kind of
		manifestation of a subconscious
		desire to break away from her so
		that I can pursue the possibility
		of a more meaningful relationship
		with Caitlin.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Caitlin's on the same wave-length?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I think it's safe to say yes.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Then I think all four of you had
		better sit down and talk it over.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		All four?

<b>				RANDAL

		The Empire Strikes Back.

<b>				DANTE
</b>			(exasperated)
		Empire.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Blasphemy.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Empire had the better ending: Luke
		gets his hand cut off, and finds
		out Vader's his father; Han gets
		frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.
		It ends on such a down note. And
		that's life-a series of down
		endings. All Jedi had was a bunch
		of Muppets.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		There was something else going on
		in Jedi. I never noticed it until
		today.

	RANDAL follows DANTE as he cleans up around the store.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		What's that?

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		All right, Vader's boss...

<b>				DANTE
</b>		The Emperor.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor
		is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		How do you mean?

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Well, he's like the pope for the
		dark side of the Force. He's a holy
		man; a shaman, kind of, albeit an
		evil one.

<b>									47.
</b>

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I guess.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Now, he's in charge of the Empire.
		The Imperial government is under
		his control. And the entire galaxy
		is under Imperial rule.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Yeah.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Then wouldn't that logically mean
		that it's a theocracy? If the head
		of the Empire is a priest of some
		sort, then it stands to reason that
		the government is therefore one
		based on religion.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		It would stand to reason, yes.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Hence, the Empire was a fascist
		theocracy, and the rebel forces
		were therefore battling religious
		persecution.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		More or less.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		The only problem is that at no
		point in the series did I ever hear
		Leia or any of the rebels declare a
		particular religious belief.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I think they were Catholics.

	A BLUE-COLLAR MAN half enters the door.

<b>				BLUE-COLLAR MAN
</b>		Are you open?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Yeah. Come in.

	He goes to the coffee machine and makes a cup of joe.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		You know what else I noticed in Jedi?

<b>									48.
</b>

<b>				DANTE
</b>		There's more?

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		So they build another Death Star,
		right?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Yeah.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Now the first one they built was
		completed and fully operational
		before the Rebels destroyed it.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Luke blew it up. Give credit where
		it's due.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		And the second one was still being
		built when they blew it up.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Compliments of Lando Calrissian.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Something just never sat right with
		me the second time they destroyed
		it. I could never put my finger on
		it-something just wasn't right.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		And you figured it out?

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Well, the thing is, the first Death
		Star was manned by the Imperial
		army-storm troopers, dignitaries-
		the only people onboard were
		Imperials.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Basically.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		So when they blew it up, no prob.
		Evil is punished.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		And the second time around...?

<b>									49.
</b>

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		The second time around, it wasn't
		even finished yet. They were still
		under construction.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		So?

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		A construction job of that magnitude
		would require a helluva lot more
		manpower than the Imperial army had
		to offer. I'll bet there were
		independent contractors working on
		that thing: plumbers, aluminum
		siders, roofers.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Not just Imperials, is what you're
		getting at.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Exactly. In order to get it built
		quickly and quietly they'd hire
		anybody who could do the job. Do
		you think the average storm trooper
		knows how to install a toilet main?
		All they know is killing and white
		uniforms.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		All right, so even if independent
		contractors are working on the
		Death Star, why are you uneasy with
		its destruction?

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		All those innocent contractors
		hired to do a job were killed-
		casualties of a war they had
		nothing to do with.
			(notices Dante's confusion)
		All right, look-you're a roofer,
		and some juicy government contract
		comes your way; you got the wife
		and kids and the two-story in
		suburbia-this is a government
		contract, which means all sorts of
		benefits. All of a sudden these
		left-wing militants blast you with
		lasers and wipe out everyone within
		a three-mile radius.

<b>				BLUE-COLLAR MAN

		talking about?

<b>				RANDAL

<b>				DANTE
</b>		My friend is trying to convince me
		that any contractors working on the
		uncompleted Death Star were innocent
		victims when the space station was
		destroyed by the rebels.

<b>				BLUE-COLLAR MAN
</b>		Well, I'm a contractor myself. I'm
		a roofer...

		Dunn and Reddy Home Improvements.
		And speaking as a roofer, I can say
		that a roofer's personal politics
		come heavily into play when choosing
		jobs.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Like when?

<b>				BLUE-COLLAR MAN
</b>		Three months ago I was offered a
		job up in the hills. A beautiful
		house with tons of property. It was
		a simple reshingling job, but I was
		told that if it was finished within
		a day, my price would be doubled.
		Then I realized whose house it was.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Whose house was it?

<b>				BLUE-COLLAR MAN
</b>		Dominick Bambino's.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		"Babyface" Bambino? The gangster?

<b>									51.
</b>

<b>				BLUE-COLLAR MAN
</b>		The same. The money was right, but
		the risk was too big. I knew who he
		was, and based on that, I passed
		the job on to a friend of mine.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Based on personal politics.

<b>				BLUE-COLLAR MAN
</b>		Right. And that week, the Foresci
		family put a hit on Babyface's
		house. My friend was shot and
		killed. He wasn't even finished
		shingling.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		No way!

<b>				BLUE-COLLAR MAN
</b>			(paying for coffee)
		I'm alive because I knew there were
		risks involved taking on that
		particular client. My friend wasn't
		so lucky.
			(pauses to reflect)
		You know, any contractor willing to
		work on that Death Star knew the
		risks. If they were killed, it was
		their own fault. A roofer listens
		to this...

	The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER challenges him.

<b>				INDECISIVE CUSTOMER

		You've never heard anybody say
		anything about either movie?

<b>				RANDAL (O.C.)
</b>		I find it's best to stay out of
		other people's affairs.

<b>				INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
</b>			(with a new determination)
		Well, how about these two movies?
			(holds up the same two)


	RANDAL continues to read his paper, not looking up.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		They suck.

	The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER smirks smugly at RANDAL and his
	paper. She has caught him.

<b>				INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
</b>		I just held up the same two movies.
		You're not even paying attention.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		No, I wasn't.

<b>				INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
</b>		I don't think your manager would
		appreciate...

<b>				RANDAL
</b>			(turning the page)
		I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.

<b>				INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
</b>		I beg your pardon!

<b>				RANDAL
</b>			(reading on)
		Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to
		trick me.

<b>				INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
</b>			(defending herself)
		I only pointed out that you weren't
		paying any attention to what I was
		saying.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>			(turning page and reading)
		I hope it feels good.

<b>				INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
</b>		You hope what feels good?

<b>									54.
</b>

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		I hope it feels so good to be right.
		There is nothing more exhilarating
		than pointing out the shortcomings
		of others, is there?

	The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER wears a face that belies utter
	disbelief in the audacity of this most lackadaisical video
	clerk. The unmoving newspaper illustrates the total
	disinterest of the news-hungry RANDAL. The INDECISIVE
	CUSTOMER shakes her head in disgust and throws the movies
	back onto the wall.

<b>				INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
</b>			(in a huff)
		Well this is the last time I ever
		rent here...

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		You'll be missed.

<b>				INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
</b>			(losing it altogether)
		Screw you!

	She storms out. RANDAL is offended. He hops over the counter
	and whips the door open.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>			(calling after her)
		You're not allowed to rent here
		anymore!

	RANDAL closes the door and stands there, momentarily,
	totally appalled by her exiting remark, then shakes his head.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Screw me!

	He reaches behind the counter and grabs a ring of keys.
	Exiting, he locks the door behind him from the outside,
	gives it a tug to ensure its security, and storms off in the

	DANTE is staring, open-mouthed, at something O.C. RANDAL
	hurls the door open and immediately launches into his tirade.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		You'll never believe what this
		unruly customer just said...

<b>									55.
</b>

<b>				DANTE
</b>			(a hand up to urge
			him to hush)
		Wait.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>			(looking around)
		She's in here?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		This guy is going through all of
		the eggs. Look.

	An ODD MAN sits on the floor, surrounded by cartons of eggs,
	all opened. He grabs a carton from the cooler case, pops it
	open, and examines each egg carefully.

<b>				DANTE (O.C.)
</b>		This has been going on for twenty
		minutes.

	RANDAL and DANTE study the O.C. oddity.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		What's he looking for?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		He said he has to find a perfect
		dozen.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Perfect dozen.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Each egg has to be perfect.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		The quest isn't going well?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Obviously not. Look at all the
		cartons that didn't make the grade.

	The ODD MAN holds an egg up to the light and studies it from
	several different angles.

<b>				RANDAL (O.C.)
</b>		Why doesn't he just mix and match?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I told him that and he yelled at me.

	RANDAL snickers at his friend.

<b>									56.
</b>

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		What did he say?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		He said it was important to have
		standards. He said nobody has pride
		anymore.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		It's not like you laid the eggs
		yourself.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I'll give him five more minutes
		then I'm calling the cops. I don't
		need this, man. I'm not even
		supposed to be here today.

	A SMOKER steps in.

<b>				SMOKER
</b>		Two packs of cigarettes.

	Dante manages to break his study of the O.C. oddity and
	searches for the smokes. The smoker glances at RANDAL and
	then at the O.C. oddity.

	The ODD MAN is spinning an egg on the floor. The SMOKER
	looks at RANDAL.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>			(still staring at the
<b>			ODD MAN)
</b>		I'm as puzzled as you.

<b>				SMOKER
</b>			(paying DANTE)
		I've actually seen it before.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		You know him?

<b>				SMOKER
</b>		No, I've seen that behavior before.
		Looking for the perfect carton of
		eggs, right?

<b>				RANDAL
</b>			(a bit astonished)
		Yeah. How'd you know?

<b>				SMOKER
</b>		I'll bet you a million bucks that
		the guy's a guidance counselor.

<b>									57.
</b>

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Why do you say that?

<b>				SMOKER
</b>		I was in the Food City last year
		when the same thing happened,
		different guy though. Stock boy
		told me that the guy had been
		looking through the eggs for like
		half an hour, doing all sorts of
		endurance tests and shit. I ask the
		kid how come nobody called the
		manager, and he says it happens
		twice a week, sometimes more.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Get out of here.

<b>				SMOKER
</b>		I kid you not. They call it Shell
		Shock. Only happens with guidance
		counselors for some reason. The kid
		said they used to make a big deal
		about it, but there's no point.

	The ODD MAN places a handkerchief over an egg on the floor.
	He quickly whisks the handkerchief away to reveal the egg
	still sitting on the floor.

<b>				SMOKER (O.C.)
</b>		He said they always pay for whatever
		they break and they never bother
		anybody.

	DANTE, RANDAL and the SMOKER stare at the O.C. man.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Why guidance counselors?

<b>				SMOKER
</b>		If your job served as little
		purpose as theirs, wouldn't you
		lose it, too?

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Come to think of it, my guidance
		counselor was kind of worthless.

<b>				SMOKER
</b>			(grabbing matches)
		See? It's important to have a job
		that makes a difference, boys.
		That's why I kill Chinamen for the

	The CUSTOMER stands silently, awaiting something.

	impatiently. He grabs the ladder and quickly ascends.

	Above, from over the ledge of the roof, we see the head of
	the customer peek. Skating feet pass rapidly before him, and
	he watches for a moment before calling out.

<b>				CUSTOMER
</b>		When's this period over?

<b>				SOMEONE (O.C.)
</b>		Eight more minutes!

<b>				CUSTOMER
</b>		Are you shitting me? I want to get
		cigarettes!

	DANTE skids to the sidelines.

<b>				DANTE
</b>			(out of breath)
		If you can just wait a few more
		minutes.

<b>									73.
</b>

<b>				CUSTOMER
</b>		Fuck that! I'm gonna break my crazy
		neck on this ladder!

<b>				SOMEONE (O.C.)
</b>		Dante! Where are you?!

<b>				CUSTOMER
</b>		He's busy!

	DANTE starts to skate away.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I'll be right back. It's almost over.

	He jumps back into the game.

<b>				CUSTOMER
</b>		What the fuck is this?! I want some
		service!

<b>				DANTE (O.C.)
</b>		In a second!

<b>				CUSTOMER
</b>		Fuck in a second! This is...Look at
		you! You can't even pass!

<b>				DANTE (O.C.)
</b>		I can pass!

<b>				CUSTOMER
</b>		How 'bout covering point!? You suck!

	DANTE skids back to the sidelines to address the CUSTOMER.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Who are you to make assessments?

<b>				CUSTOMER
</b>		I'll assess all I want!

<b>				SOMEONE (O.C.)
</b><b>		DANTE! ARE YOU IN OR OUT!
</b>
<b>				CUSTOMER
</b>			(to O.C. SOMEONE)
		Don't pass to this guy! He sucks!
			(to DANTE)
		You suck!

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Like you're better!

<b>									74.
</b>

<b>				CUSTOMER
</b>		I can whip your ass.

	Below, a WOMAN pulls at the door. She peers into the store,
	face against the glass.

<b>				DANTE (O.C.)
</b>		That's easy to say from over here.

<b>				CUSTOMER (O.C.)
</b>		Give me a stick, pretty boy! I'll
		knock your fucking teeth out and
		pass all over your ass.

	The WOMAN backs up and, shielding her eyes, looks toward the
	roof.

<b>				WOMAN
</b>		Is the convenience store open?

	Above, DANTE and the CUSTOMER shout down at the O.C. WOMAN.

<b>				DANTE AND CUSTOMER
</b>			(simultaneously)
<b>		NO!
</b>
<b>				DANTE
</b>			(to CUSTOMER)
		There's a stick over there. You're
		shooting against the goal.
			(to the court)
<b>		REDDING! COME OFF AND LET THIS FUCK
</b><b>		ON!
</b>
	A new face-off pits DANTE against the CUSTOMER. The ball
	drops between the two and DANTE gets flattened. The CUSTOMER
	winds up and takes a hard shot. The ball sails off the
	court, through the air, and into a faraway yard. DANTE calls
	to the sidelines.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Give me another ball.

<b>				SOMEONE (O.C.)
</b>		There are no more.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		What the fuck are you talking about?
		How many balls did you bring?

	SANFORD skates up to him.

<b>									75.
</b>

<b>				SANFORD
</b>			(counting)
		There was the orange ball...and the
		orange ball.

	DANTE scrambles to the edge and calls over.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Are there any balls down there?!

<b>				JAY (O.C.)
</b>		'Bout the biggest pair you ever
		seen! NYNNE!!

	DANTE looks around, hyperventilating.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		You only brought one ball?!

<b>				SANFORD
</b>		I thought Redding had like three
		balls!

<b>				REDDING (O.C.)
</b>		I thought Dante had the balls.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Nobody has another ball?

<b>				SANFORD
</b>		Shit!

<b>				DANTE
</b>		We get...what...twelve minutes of
		game, and it's over? Fuck! Fuck!
		Fuck! Fuck!!
			(pause; rubs head)
		I'm not even supposed to be here
		today!

	DANTE skates off.

<b>				SANFORD
</b>		We still get free Gatorade, right?

	DANTE standing on a ladder, replaces a fluorescent light. An
	OLD MAN joins him at the foot of the ladder.

<b>				OLD MAN
</b>		Be careful.

<b>									76.
</b>

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I'm trying.

<b>				OLD MAN
</b>		You know the insides of those are
		filled with stuff that gives you
		cancer.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		So I'm told.

<b>				OLD MAN
</b>		I had a friend that used to chew
		glass for a living. In the circus.

	The light in place, DANTE descends the ladder and closes it.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		And he got cancer by chewing
		fluorescent bulb glass...?

<b>				OLD MAN
</b>		No, he got hit by a bus.

<b>				DANTE
</b>			(confused)
		Oh...Can I help you?

<b>				OLD MAN
</b>		Well, that depends. Do you have a
		bathroom?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Um...yeah, but it's for employees
		only.

<b>				OLD MAN
</b>		I understand, but can I use it. I'm
		not that young anymore, so I'm kind
		of...you know...incontinent.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Uh...sure. Go ahead. It's back
		through the cooler.

<b>				OLD MAN
</b>		Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet
		paper you got back there?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		The white kind.

<b>									77.
</b>

<b>				OLD MAN
</b>		I'm not asking about the color. I
		mean is it rough or cottony?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Actually, it is kind of rough.

<b>				OLD MAN
</b>		Rough, eh? Oh, that stuff rips hell
		out of my hemorrhoids. Say, would
		you mind if I took a roll of the
		soft stuff back there. I see you
		sell the soft stuff.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Yeah, but...

<b>				OLD MAN
</b>		Aw, c'mon boy. What's the difference?
		You said yourself the stuff that's
		there now is rough.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Yeah, okay. Go ahead.

<b>				OLD MAN
</b>		Thanks son, you're a lifesaver.

	The OLD MAN walks off. DANTE heads back to the counter. The
	OLD MAN returns.

<b>				OLD MAN
</b>		Say, young fella, you know I hate
		to bother you again, but can I take
		a paper or something back there...to
		read? It usually takes me a while,
		and I like to read while it's going
		on.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Jesus...go ahead.

<b>				OLD MAN
</b>		Thanks, young man. You've got a
		heart of gold.

	The OLD MAN sifts through some papers and a few magazines.
	He comes back to the counter.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		You know, you probably could've
		been home, already, in the time
		it's taken you to get in there.

<b>									78.
</b>

<b>				OLD MAN
</b>		Can I trouble you for one of those
		magazines?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I said go ahead.

<b>				OLD MAN
</b>		No, I mean the ones there. Behind
		the counter.

	DANTE glances over and reacts.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		The porno mags?

<b>				OLD MAN
</b>		Yeah. I like the cartoons. They
		make me laugh. They draw the
		biggest titties.

<b>				DANTE
</b>			(hands one to him)
		Here. Now leave me alone.

<b>				OLD MAN
</b>		Uh, can I have the other one. The
		one below this one. They show more
		in that one.

	DANTE makes the switch.

<b>				OLD MAN
</b>		Thanks son. I appreciate this.

	The OLD MAN walks off. We hear the back door open and close,
	then the front door does the same. RANDAL joins DANTE.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Helluva game!

<b>				DANTE
</b>		One ball!! They come all the way
		here...I close the damn store...for
		one ball!

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Hockey's hockey. At least we got to
		play.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Randal, twelve minutes is not a
		game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!

<b>									79.
</b>

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want
		something to drink?
			(walking away)


<b>				DANTE
</b>		Gatorade.

	Pause. Then...

<b>				RANDAL (O.C.)
</b>		What happened to all the Gatorade?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Exactly. They drank it all.

<b>				RANDAL (O.C.)
</b>		After an exhausting game like that
		I can believe it.

<b>				DANTE
</b>			(as RANDAL)
		"It's not like we're gonna sell
		out."

	RANDAL comes back with drinks.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		You know what Sanford told me?
			(offering drink)


<b>				DANTE
</b>		I still can't believe Caitlin's
		getting married.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Julie Dwyer died.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Yeah, right.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		No, I'm serious.

	DANTE is visibly taken aback.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Oh, my god.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Sanford's brother dates her cousin.
		He found out this morning.

<b>									80.
</b>

<b>				DANTE
</b>		How? When?

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Jesus.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		She was swimming at the YMCA pool
		when it happened. Died midbackstroke.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I haven't seen her in almost two
		years.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't
		she one of the illustrious twelve?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Number six.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		You've had sex with a dead person.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I'm gonna go to her wake.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		No, you're not.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Why not?

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		It's today.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		What!?

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next
		show is at four.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Shit. What about tomorrow?

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		One night only. She's buried in the
		morning.

<b>									81.
</b>

<b>				DANTE
</b>		You've gotta watch the store. I
		have to go to this.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred
		to you that I might bereaved as well?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		You hardly knew her!

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		True, but do you know how many
		people are going to be there? All
		of our old classmates, to say the
		least.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Stop it. This is beneath even you.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		I'm not missing what's probably
		going to be the social event of the
		season.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		You hate people.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		But I love gatherings. Isn't it
		ironic?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Don't be an asshole. Somebody has
		to stay with the store.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		If you go, I go.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		She meant nothing to you!

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		She meant nothing to you either
		until I told you she died.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I'm not taking you to this funeral.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		I'm going with you.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I can't close the store.

<b>									82.
</b>

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		You just closed the store to play
		hockey on the roof!

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Exactly, which means I can't close
		it for another hour so we can both
		go to a wake.

	DANTE drives with passenger RANDAL, their backs to the camera.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		You were saying?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Thanks for putting me in a tough
		spot. You're a good friend.

	Silence. Then...

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		She was pretty young, hunhh?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Twenty-two; same as us.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		An embolism in a pool.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		An embarrassing way to die.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		That's nothing compared to how my
		cousin Walter died.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		How'd he die?

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Broke his neck.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		That's embarrassing?

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		He broke his neck trying to suck
		his own dick.

	Absolute silence. Then...

<b>									83.
</b>

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Shut the hell up.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Bible truth.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Stop it.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		I swear.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Oh, my god.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Come on. Haven't you ever tried to
		suck your own dick?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		No!

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Yeah sure. You're so repressed.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Because I never tried to suck my
		own dick?

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		No, because you won't admit to it.
		As if a guy's a fucking pervert
		because he tries to go down on
		himself. You're as curious as the
		rest of us, pal. You've tried it.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Who found him?

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		My cousin? My aunt found him. On
		his bed, doubled over himself with
		his legs on top. Dick in his mouth.
		My aunt freaked out. It was a mess.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		His dick was in his mouth?

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Balls resting on his lips.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		He made it, hunhh?

<b>									84.
</b>

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Yeah, but at what a price.

	Silence. Then...

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I could never reach.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Reach what?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		You know.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		What, your dick?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Yeah. Like you said, you know. I
		guess everyone tries it, sooner of
		later.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		I never tried it.

	DANTE glares at RANDAL. Silence. Then...

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Fucking pervert.

	DANTE and RANDAL walk up the path to the funeral parlor.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I know it was a bad idea to close
		the store.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Listen to you.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I can't help it. At least when we
		were playing hockey outside, I
		could see if anyone wanted to go in.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Nobody's there. It's four o'clock
		on a Saturday. How many people ever
		come to the store at four on a
		Saturday?

<b>						CUT TO:

	A MASSIVE CROWD is outside the store.

	DANTE and RANDAL run from the front door, closely chased by
	a small crowd of angry mourners. Car locks are slammed down.
	The car screams away. The pursuing crowd stands in the
	middle of the street, shaking their fists, throwing things.

<b>						CUT TO:

	The car pulls up and RANDAL and DANTE get out. Absolutely
	nobody is outside.

<b>				DANTE
</b>			(furious)
		I can't fucking believe you!!

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!

<b>				DANTE
</b>		You knocked the fucking casket
		over, for Chrissakes!

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		I was just leaning on it! It was an
		accident!

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Does anyone ever knock over a
		casket on purpose?

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		So the casket fell over! Big deal!

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Her fucking body fell out!

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		So they'll put her back in! It's
		not like it's gonna matter if she
		breaks something!

<b>				DANTE
</b>			(opening door)
		Just...go! Go open the video store.

<b>									86.
</b>

<b>				JAY (O.C.)
</b>			(mimicking)
		Yeah! Open the video store!!

<b>				RANDAL
</b>			(to O.C.)
		Shut the fuck up, junkie!

	JAY enters the frame, right next to RANDAL. He aims his butt
	at him and farts. RANDAL lunges for him. DANTE grabs RANDAL.

<b>				DANTE
</b>			(to RANDAL)
		Go open the video store.

<b>				JAY
</b>		Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.

<b>				DANTE
</b>			(to JAY)
		How many times I gotta tell you not
		to deal outside the store.

<b>				JAY
</b>		I'm not dealing.

	A KID tugs at JAY'S shirt.

<b>				KID
</b>		You got anything, man?

<b>				JAY
</b>		Yeah, what do you want?

	RANDAL heads to the video store. DANTE enters the convenience
	store and slides the sign to OPEN. After a few seconds, the
	IMPATIENT CUSTOMER (guy who lost his keys) appears,
	flashlight in hand, scanning the ground.

<b>				IMPATIENT CUSTOMER
</b>			(to JAY)
		Hey, did you see a set of keys
		lying around here somewhere?

<b>						CUT TO:

	DANTE rearranges the milk. RANDAL joins him.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Let me borrow your car.

<b>									87.
</b>

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I don't want to talk to you.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Fine. Just lend me your car.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Why should I loan you my car?

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		I want to rent a movie.

<b>				DANTE
</b>			(pause)
		You want to rent a movie.

	DANTE walks away, shaking his head.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		What's that for?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		You work in a video store!

	They head back to the counter.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		I work in a shitty video store. I
		want to go to a good video store so
		I can rent a good movie.

<b>				CUSTOMER
</b>		Are you open?

<b>				DANTE AND RANDAL
</b>			(simultaneously)
<b>		YES!
</b>
	The CUSTOMER comes to the counter.

<b>				CUSTOMER
</b>		Pack of cigarettes.
			(pets cat)
		Cute cat. What's its name?

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Annoying Customer.

	The CUSTOMER lets it sink in, and then leaves in a huff.
	DANTE puts up cigarettes.

<b>									88.
</b>

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Can you imagine being halfway
		decent to the customers at least
		some of the time?

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Let me borrow your car.

<b>				DANTE
</b>			(calmer)
		May I be blunt with you?

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		If you must.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		We are employees of Quick Stop
		Convenience and RST video,
		respectively. As such, we have
		certain responsibilities which-
		though it may seem cruel and
		unusual-does include manning our
		posts until closing.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		I see. So playing hockey and
		attending wakes-these practices are
		standard operating procedure.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		There's a difference. Those were
		obligations. Obligations that could
		not have been met at any later date.
		Now renting videos-that's just
		gratuitous, not to mention
		illogical, considering you work in
		a video store.

	Another CUSTOMER leans in.

<b>				CUSTOMER
</b>		Are you open?

<b>				DANTE
</b>			(rolls his eyes)
		Yes.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		You know what? I don't think I care
		for you rationale.

<b>									89.
</b>

<b>				DANTE
</b>		It's going to have to do for now,
		considering that it's my car that's
		up for request.
			(to CUSTOMER)
		Can I help you?

<b>				CUSTOMER
</b>		Pack of cigarettes.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		What's your point?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		My point is that you're a clerk,
		paid to do a job. You can't just do
		anything you want while you're
		working.

<b>				CUSTOMER
</b>			(reading tabloid)
		"Space Alien Revealed as Head of
		Time Warner; Reports Stock
		Increase."
			(to DANTE and RANDAL)
		They print any kind of shit in
		these papers.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		They certainly do. Two fifty-five.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		So your argument is that title
		dictates behavior?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		What?

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		The reasons you won't let me borrow
		your care is because I have a title
		and a job description, and I'm
		supposed to follow it, right?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Exactly.

<b>				CUSTOMER
</b>			(interjecting)
		I saw one, one time, that said the
		world was ending the next week.
<b>				(MORE)
</b>
<b>									90.
</b>

<b>				CUSTOMER (CONT'D)
</b>		Then in the next week's paper, they
		said we were miraculously saved at
		the zero hour by a Koala-fish
		mutant bird. Crazy shit.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>			(eyes the CUSTOMER, annoyed)
		So I'm no more responsible for my
		own decisions while I'm here at
		work than, say, the Death Squad
		soldiers in Bosnia?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		That's stretching it. You're not
		being asked to slay children or
		anything.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Not yet.
			(sips water)


<b>				CUSTOMER
</b>			(again with the interjections)
		And I remember this one time the
		damn paper said...

	RANDAL spits a mist of water at the customer, drenching him.
	The man reacts violently, attempting to grab RANDAL from
	over the counter. RANDAL makes no move, but remains untouched.
	DANTE plays block.

<b>				CUSTOMER
</b><b>		I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING HEAD!
</b><b>		YOU FUCKING JERKOFF!
</b>
<b>				DANTE
</b>		Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean
		it! He was trying to get me.

<b>				CUSTOMER
</b>		Well, he missed!

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund
		your cigarette money, and we'll
		call it even.

<b>									91.
</b>

<b>				CUSTOMER
</b>			(considerably calmer;
			takes money)
		This is the last time I ever come
		here.
			(to RANDAL)
		And if I ever see you again, I'm
		gonna break your fucking head open!

	The CUSTOMER leaves, wiping water from his face. RANDAL
	salutes him.

<b>				DANTE
</b>			(angrily)
		What the fuck did you do that for?

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Two reasons: one, I hate when the
		people can't shut up about the
		stupid tabloid headlines.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Jesus!

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		And two, to make a point: title
		does not dictate behavior.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		What?

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		If title dictated my behavior, as a
		clerk serving the public, I wouldn't
		be allowed to spit a mouthful of
		water at that guy. But I did, so my
		point is that people dictate their
		own behavior. Hence, even though
		I'm a clerk in this video store, I
		choose to go rent videos at Big
		Choice.
			(extends opened palm)
		Agreed?

<b>				DANTE
</b>			(shakes his head;
			hands over keys)
		You're a danger to both the dead
		and the living.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		I like to think I'm a master of my
		own destiny.

<b>									92.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Please, get the hell out of here.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		I know I'm your hero.

	DANTE waits on a customer (TRAINER). He lifts the gallon of
	milk into a paper bag, letting out a slight grunt.

<b>				TRAINER
</b>		Sounds to me like somebody needs to
		hit the gym.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Excuse me?

<b>				TRAINER
</b>		I heard you strain when you put the
		milk in the bag. That milk only
		weighs about seven pounds.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I didn't strain. I sighed.

<b>				TRAINER
</b>		I don't think so. That was a grunt;
		a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid
		in the stretching of muscles. I'm a
		trainer. I know what that sound
		signifies: you're out of shape.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I don't think so.

<b>				TRAINER
</b>		Oh, I do. You made the same noise
		when you reached across the counter
		for my cash. Your muscles are thin
		and sadly underutilized.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		They are not.

<b>				TRAINER
</b>		Yes, they are. You're out of shape.

<b>									93.
</b>

<b>				DANTE
</b>		What are you talking about? There's
		no fat on this body.

<b>				TRAINER
</b>		No fat, but no tone either. You
		don't get enough exercise.

	A female customer (HEATHER) leans in the doorway.

<b>				HEATHER
</b>		Are you open?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Yes.

<b>				HEATHER
</b>			(grabs a paper)
		Just the paper.

<b>				DANTE
</b>			(to HEATHER)
		Thirty-fire.

<b>				TRAINER
</b>			(to HEATHER)
		Let me ask you a question: Do you
		think this guy's out of shape?

<b>				HEATHER
</b>			(studies DANTE)
		I don't know. I can't really tell
		from here.

<b>				TRAINER
</b>		He is.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I am not.

<b>				TRAINER
</b>		How much can you bench?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I don't know.

<b>				HEATHER
</b>			(studying DANTE)
		I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I know I can bench more than that!

<b>									94.
</b>

<b>				TRAINER
</b>		I think the lady called it.

<b>				HEATHER
</b>		My ex-boyfriend was about his
		height, but he was much bulkier. He
		could bench two-fifty, three
		hundred easy.

<b>				TRAINER
</b>		I do about three-fifty, four.

<b>				HEATHER
</b>		No way!

<b>				TRAINER
</b>			(rolling up sleeve)
		Feel that.

<b>				HEATHER
</b>		That's tight. Solid.

<b>				TRAINER
</b>		Now feel his.
			(to DANTE)
		Roll up your sleeve, chief.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Oh for God's sake!

<b>				TRAINER
</b>		See? You're ashamed. You know
		you're out of shape. Take my card.
		I can help you tone that body up in

<b>				SUITED MAN
</b>		You open?

<b>				DANTE

		Yes.

		I'm not out of shape.

<b>				SUITED MAN
</b>		Excuse me, but have you been here
		all day?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		What?

</b>

<b>				HEATHER
</b>			(still studying DANTE)
		He's got those love handles.

<b>				DANTE
</b>			(to HEATHER)
		I don't have love handles.

<b>				SUITED MAN
</b>		Were you working here at about four
		o'clock?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I've been here since six o'clock
		this morning. Why?

<b>				TRAINER
</b>			(to HEATHER)
		It's probably from being around all
		this food every day.

<b>				HEATHER
</b>		Oh, I know. If I had to work here
		all day, I'd be bloated and out of
		shape, too.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I'm not out of shape!

<b>				SUITED MAN
</b>		Can I have your name please?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Dante Hicks. Why? What is this about?

	The SUITED MAN scribbles in his notebook.

<b>				HEATHER
</b>		You're Dante Hicks? Oh my God! I
		didn't even recognize you!

<b>				TRAINER
</b>		Because he's out of shape.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Do I know you?

<b>				HEATHER
</b>		You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung
		out with...

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Caitlin Bree. Yeah?

<b>									96.
</b>

<b>				HEATHER
</b>		I'm her sister.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?

<b>				HEATHER
</b>		Yep. I remember you got caught in
		my parents' room with Caitlin once.

<b>				TRAINER
</b>		Did you say Caitlin Bree?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Yeah.

<b>				TRAINER
</b>		Pretty girl, about this girl's
		height-dark hair-gorgeous body?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Yeah?

<b>				TRAINER
</b>		And your name is Dante Hicks? You
		went to high school with her? You
		played hockey?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		How do you know that?

<b>				TRAINER
</b>		Oh man! Hey, you still going out
		with her?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		No, she's getting married.

<b>				TRAINER
</b>		To you?

<b>				HEATHER
</b>		To an Asian design major.

<b>				TRAINER
</b>		Shit!
			(to DANTE)
		Don't take this the wrong way, but
		I used to fuck her.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		What?

<b>									97.
</b>

<b>				TRAINER
</b>		While you two were dating in high
		school. We're talking four, five
		years ago, back when I drove a
		Trans-Am.

<b>				HEATHER
</b>		Oh my God! You're Rick Derris?

<b>				TRAINER
</b>		Yeah!

<b>				DANTE
</b>		You know him?

<b>				HEATHER
</b>		Caitlin used to talk about him all
		the time.

<b>				TRAINER
</b>		Really?

<b>				HEATHER
</b>		Oh yeah. You were the built older
		guy with the black Trans and the
		big...

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Wait a second!
			(to TRAINER)
		You used to sleep with Caitlin Bree?
		While I was dating her?

<b>				TRAINER
</b>		All the time. That girl was like a
		rabbit.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I...I don't believe this...

<b>				HEATHER
</b>			(to TRAINER)
		I still remember Caitlin telling us
		about that time you two went to
		that motel-the one with the mirrors
		and the hot tub in the room.

<b>				DANTE
</b><b>		THE GLADES MOTEL?
</b>
<b>									98.
</b>

<b>				TRAINER
</b>		Holy shit! She told you about that!
			(to DANTE)
		Buddy of mine worked there. Said he
		watched the whole thing. They used
		to film people at that hotel;
		nobody knew about it.

<b>				HEATHER
</b>		She said one time you set up a tent
		on the beach and you guys did it in
		the middle of this big rainstorm.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		What? When? When did all this shit
		happen?

<b>				TRAINER
</b>		Hey man, that was a long time ago.
		Don't let it get to you.

<b>				HEATHER
</b>		I'm surprised you never found out
		about it, Dante. Everybody in
		school knew-even in my class.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Jesus Christ, what next?

	The SUITED MAN rips a piece of paper out of his notebook and
	hands it to DANTE.

<b>				SUITED MAN
</b>		Here you go.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		What's this?

<b>				SUITED MAN
</b>		A fine, for five hundred dollars.

<b>				DANTE
</b><b>		WHAT?
</b>
<b>				TRAINER
</b>		Five hundred bucks? What for?

<b>				SUITED MAN
</b>		For violation of New Jersey Statute
		Section Two A, number one-seventy
		slash fifty-one: Any person who
		sells or makes available tobacco or
		tobacco-related products to persons
		under the age of eighteen is
		regarded as disorderly.

<b>									99.
</b>

<b>				DANTE
</b>		What are you talking about?

<b>				SUITED MAN
</b>		According to the NJAC-the New
		Jersey Administrative Code, section
		eighteen, five, slash twelve point
		five-a fine of no less than two
		hundred and fifty dollars is to be
		leveled against any person reported
		selling cigarettes to a minor.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I didn't do that!

<b>				SUITED MAN
</b>		You said you were here all day?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes
		to any kids!

<b>				SUITED MAN
</b>		An angry mother called the state
		division of taxation and complained
		that the man working at Quick Stop
		Convenience sold her five-year-old
		daughter cigarettes today at around
		four o'clock. Division of taxation
		calls the State Board of Health,
		and they send me down here to issue
		a fine. You say you were working
		all day, hence the fine is yours.
		It's doubled due to the incredibly
		young age of the child.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		But I didn't sell cigarettes to any
		kid!

<b>				TRAINER
</b>		To a five-year-old kid? What a
		scumbag!

<b>				HEATHER
</b>		That's sick, Dante.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I didn't sell cigarettes to any
		kids! I swear!

<b>									100.
</b>

<b>				SUITED MAN
</b>		The due date is on the bottom. This
		summons cannot be contested in any
		court of law. Failure to remit
		before the due date will result in
		a charge of criminal negligence,
		and a warrant will be issued for
		your arrest. Have a nice day.

	The SUITED MAN exits, with DANTE trying to follow.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		But I didn't sell cigarettes to any
		kids! Hey!

<b>				TRAINER
</b>			(takes back the card)
		Forget it. I don't want to deal
		with a guy that sells cigarettes to
		a five-year-old.
			(to HEATHER)
		Can I offer you a ride somewhere?

<b>				HEATHER
</b>		Sure. How about the beach?

<b>				TRAINER
</b>		I like the way you think.

	The two exit. DANTE, alone, studies his summons. He rubs his
	forehead.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Jesus! What next?

<b>				VOICE (O.C.)
</b>		Dante?

	DANTE spins, angrily.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		What?

	His expression softens.

</b>		What, it's worse? You're pregnant

</b>		I know, I'm sorry. But when we

<b>				DANTE
</b>		So you're really getting married?

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		No.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		No, you're not really getting
		married?

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		The story goes like this: He
		proposed, and I told him I had to
		think about it, and he insisted I
		wear the ring anyway. Then my
		mother told the paper we were
		engaged.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		How like her.

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		Then my mother called me this
		morning and told me the announcement
		was in the paper. That's when I
		hopped the train to come back here,
		because I knew you'd be a wreck.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Thanks for the vote of confidence.

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		Was I right?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is
		more like it. Mildly disturbed even.

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		I love a macho façade. It's such a

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		The last thing I needed was for you
		to think I was hiding something
		from you.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		But you were.

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		No, I wasn't. Not really. I told
		you'd I'd been seeing other people.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Yeah, but not seriously. Christ,
		you're ready to walk down the
		aisle-I'd say that constitutes
		something more than just seeing
		somebody.

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		I'm giving him his ring back.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		What?

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		I don't want to marry him. I don't
		want to get married now. I'm on the
		verge of graduation. I want to go
		to grad school after this. And then
		I want to start a career. I don't
		want to be a wife first, and then
		have to worry about when I'' going
		to fit in all of the other stuff.
		I've come way too far and studied
		too hard to let my education go to
		waste as a housewife. And I know
		that's what I'd become. Sang's
		already signed with a major firm,
		and he's going to be pulling a huge
		salary, which would give me no
		reason to work, and he's so
		traditional anyway...

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Sang? His name is a past tense?

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		Stop it. He's a nice guy.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		If he's so nice, why aren't you
		going to marry him?

<b>									107.

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		I just told you.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		There's more, isn't there?

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Tell me I don't have something to
		do with it.

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		You don't have anything to do with
		it.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		You lie.

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		Look how full of yourself you are.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I just believe in giving credit
		where credit is due. And I believe
		that I'm the impetus behind your
		failure to wed.

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		If I'm so nuts about you, then why
		am I having sex with an Asian
		design major?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Jesus, you're caustic.

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		I had to bring you down from that
		cloud you were floating on. When I
		say I don't want to get married, I
		mean just that. I don't want to
		marry anybody. Not for years.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		So who's asking? I don't want to
		marry you.

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		Good. Stay in that frame of mind.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Buy can we date?

<b>									108.
</b>

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would
		like that.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		We could introduce them. They might
		hit it off.

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		You're serious. You want to date
		again.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I would like to be your boyfriend,
		yes.

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		It's just the shock of seeing me
		after three years. Believe me,
		you'll get over it.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Give me a bit more credit. I think
		it's time we got back together, you
		know. I'm more mature, you're more
		mature, you're finishing college,
		I'm already in the job market...

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		You work in a market, all right.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to
		go out again. After all the talking
		we've been doing.

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		The key word here is talk, Dante. I
		think the idea, the conception of
		us dating is more idyllic than what
		actually happens when we date.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		So...what? So we should just make
		pretend over the phone that we're
		dating?

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		I don't know. Maybe we should just
		see what happens.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Let me take you out tonight.

<b>									109.
</b>

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		You mean, on a date?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie
		Date. I think I've been on that one
		before.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		You have a better suggestion?

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on
		the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked
		Somewhere Kind of Private Date?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I hear that's a rather popular date.

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>			(hits him)
		Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at
		you, succumbing to your wily
		charms, and you call me a slut, in
		so many words.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		What about Sing?

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		Sang.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Sang.

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		He's not invited.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		He's your fiancé.

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		I offer you my body and you offer
		me semantics? He's just a boyfriend,
		Dante, and in case you haven't
		gotten the drift of why I came all
		the way here from Ohio, I'm about
		to become single again.

<b>				CAITLIN (CONT'D)
</b>		And yes-let me placate your ego-you
		are the inspiration for this bold
		and momentous decision, for which
		I'll probably be ostracized at both
		school and home. You ask me who I
		choose, I choose you.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		So what are you saying?

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		You're such an asshole.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I'm just kidding.

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		I can already tell this isn't going

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I'll ask Randal to close up for me-
		when he gets back.

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		Where'd he go? I'd have thought
		he'd be at your side, like an
		obedient lapdog.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		He went to rent a movie, but he
		hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw
		it; I'll just lock the store up and
		leave him a note.

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		You're too responsible. But no. I
		have to go home first. They don't
		even know I left school. And I
		should break the disengagement news
		to my mother, which is going to
		cause quite a row, considering she
		loves Sang.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Who doesn't?

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		Well, me I guess.

		So, I shall take my leave of you,

<b>				CAITLIN

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Few are. So what makes you think
		you can maintain a relationship
		with Dante this time around?

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		A woman's intuition. Something in
		me says it's time to give the old
		boy a serious try.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Wow. Hey, I was just about to order
		some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		Dick.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Exactly.

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		So where is he?

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		God, isn't he great?

<b>				RANDAL

		No, this is great.

</b>		Can I use the bathroom?

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		There's no light back there.

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		Why aren't there any lights?

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Well, there are, but for some
		reason they stop working at five-
		fourteen every night.

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		You're kidding.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Nobody can figure it out. And the
		boss doesn't want to pay the
		electrician to fix it, because the
		electrician owes money to the video
		store.

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		Such a sordid state of affair.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		And I'm caught in the middle-torn
		between my loyalty for the boss,
		and my desire to piss with the
		light on.

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		I'll try to manage.

	She heads toward the back.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Hey Caitlin...

		Break his heart again this time,

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		You're very protective of him,

		Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You

<b>				DANTE
</b>		There's no lights back there.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		I told her that. She said she

	The cooler down is heard opening. CAITLIN walks lazily down

</b>		When you just lie perfectly still

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Um...okay.

</b>		Am I missing something here?

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		I went back there, and Dante was
		already waiting for me.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		He was?

<b>				CAITLIN
</b>		It was so cool. He didn't say a
		word. He was just...ready, you know?
		And we didn't kiss or talk or
		anything. He just sat there and let

		Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?

</b>		The body can maintain an erection

</b>		Well he asked me for it!

<b>				CORONER

		I can't say for certain until we

</b>		All right, if you hate this job and

		lot, then just wait, mister: I'm
		going to put the hookers in Times
		Square to shame with all the guys I
		go down on now!

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Would you let me explain...

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		Explain what? How you were waiting
		until the time was right, and then
		you were going to dump me for her?

<b>				DANTE
</b>			(getting up)
		Veronica...I...it's not like that
		anymore...I mean, it was never
		really like that...

<b>									137.
</b>

	VERONICA kicks him in the other leg. DANTE goes down,
	yelling in pain.

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		You're damn right it's not like
		that! Because I won't let it be
		like that! You want your slut? Fine!
		The slut is yours!

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I don't want Caitlin...

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		You don't know what you want, but
		I'm not going to sit here anymore
		holding your hand until you figure
		it out! I've encouraged you to get
		out of this fucking dump and go
		back to school, to take charge of
		your life and find direction. I
		even transferred so maybe you would
		be more inclined to go back to
		college if I was with you. Everyone
		said it was a stupid move, but I
		didn't care because I loved you and
		wanted to see you pull yourself out
		of this senseless funk you've been
		in since that whore dumped you, oh
		so many years ago. And now you want
		to go back to her so she can fuck
		you over some more?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I don't want to go back with her...

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		Of course not; not now! You're
		caught, and now you're trying to
		snake out of doing what you wanted
		to do. Well, I won't let you. I
		want you to follow through on this,
		just so you can find out what a
		fucking idiot you are. And when she
		dumps you again-and she will,
		Dante, I promise you that-when she
		dumps you again, I want to laugh at
		you, right in your face, just so
		you realize that that was what you
		gave up our relationship for!
			(grabs her purse)
		I'm just glad Randal had the balls
		to tell me, since you couldn't.

<b>									138.
</b>

<b>				DANTE
</b>			(weakly)
		Randal...?

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		And having him tell me...that was
		just the weakest move ever. You're
		spineless.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Veronica, I love you...

<b>				VERONICA
</b>		Fuck you.

	VERONICA exits. DANTE lies on the floor alone.

<b>						CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	EXT: VIDEO STORE. NIGHT
</b>
	RANDAL exits and locks the door behind him.

<b>						CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT
</b>
	Tight on RANDAL'S face as he steps inside.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Dante?

	Hands clasp around his throat and yank him out of the frame.
	DANTE throttles RANDAL, choking him to the ground. RANDAL
	throws his fists into DANTE'S midriff, throwing him back
	into the magazine rack. RANDAL jumps to his feet as DANTE
	comes at him again. RANDAL tumbles into the cakes as
	Entenman's products scatter beneath and around him. He grabs
	a pound cake and hits DANTE in the head with it, using the
	opportunity to scurry down the middle aisle. DANTE leaps at
	his feet, and RANDAL grabs the shelves, knocking aspirin
	over until RANDAL-shrieking-sprays something in DANTE'S face.
	DANTE paws at his eyes. RANDAL grabs Italian bread and
	smacks it into DANTE'S face as he rushes him blindly. DANTE
	chases him out of the frame. M&amp;M's scatter wildly across the
	empty floor, and the ruckus is heard O.C.

<b>						CUT TO:
</b>
	DANTE and RANDAL later, out of breath, on the floor. RANDAL
	sits up against the candy rack, rubbing his neck. DANTE lies
	on the floor, bacon held against a sort of crushed cookies,
	ripped-open candies, broken bread, and other damaged goods.

<b>									139.
</b>

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		How's your eye?

<b>				DANTE
</b>			(reluctantly)
		The swelling's not so bad. But the
		FDS stings.
			(then)
		How's your neck?

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		It's hard to swallow.

	They are both silent. Then...

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		You didn't have to choke me.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Why the fuck did you tell Veronica
		that I was going to dump her for
		Caitlin?

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		I thought I was doing you a favor.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Thanks.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		You were saying how you couldn't
		initiate change yourself, so I
		figured I'd help you out.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Jesus.

	Silence. Then...

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		You still didn't have to choke me.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't
		kill you.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Why do you say that?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Why do I say that? Randal...forget
		it.

<b>									140.
</b>

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		No, really. What did I do that was
		so wrong?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		What don't you do? Randal, sometimes
		it seems like the only reason you
		come to work is to make my life
		miserable.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		How do you figure?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		What time did you get to work today?

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Like ten after.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		You were over half an hour late.
		Then all you do is come over here.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		To talk to you.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Which means the video store is
		ostensibly closed.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		It's not like I'm miles away.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Unless you're out renting videos at
		other video stores.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Hermaphrodites! I rented it so we
		could watch it together!

<b>				DANTE
</b>		You get my slapped with a fine, you
		fight with the customers and I have
		to patch everything up. You get us
		chased out of a funeral by violating
		a corpse. To top it all off, you
		ruin my relationship. What's your
		encore? Do you anally rape my
		mother while pouring sugar in my
		gas tank?
<b>				(MORE)
</b>
<b>									141.
</b>

<b>				DANTE (CONT'D)
</b>			(sighs)
		You know what the real tragedy is?
		I'm not even supposed to be here
		today!

<b>				RANDAL
</b>			(suddenly outraged)
		Fuck you. Fuck you, pal. Listen to
		you trying to pass the buck again.
		I'm the source of all your misery.
		Who closed the store to play hockey?
		Who closed the store to attend a
		wake? Who tried to win back an ex-
		girlfriend without even discussing
		how he felt with his present one?
		You wanna blame somebody, blame
		yourself.
			(beat, as DANTE)
		"I'm not even supposed to be here
		today."
			(whips stuff at DANTE)
		You sound like an asshole. Whose
		choice was it to be here today?
		Nobody twisted your arm. You're
		here today of your own violation,
		my friend. But you'd like to
		believe that the weight of the
		world rests on your shoulders-that
		the store would crumble if Dante
		wasn't here. Well, I got news for
		you, jerk: This store would survive
		without you. Without me either. All
		you do is overcompensate for having
		what's basically a monkey's job:
		You push fucking buttons. Any moron
		can waltz in here and do our jobs,
		but you're obsessed with making it
		seem so much more fucking important,
		so much more epic than it really is.
		You work in a convenience store,
		Dante. And badly, I might add. And
		I work in a shitty video store.
		Badly, as well.
			(beat)
		You know, that guy Jay's got it
		right-he has no delusions about
		what he does. Us? We like to make
		ourselves seem so much better than
		the people that come in here, just
		looking to pick up a paper or-God
		forbid-cigarettes. We look down on
		them, as it we're so advanced.
		Well, if we're so fucking advanced,
		then what are we doing working here?

<b>									142.
</b>

	RANDAL gets up, leaving DANTE to contemplate his strong
	words alone.

<b>						CUT TO:
</b>
	DANTE and RANDAL silently clean up, backs to each other.

<b>						CUT TO:
</b>
	DANTE places a mop in the corner. RANDAL pulls on his coat.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		I threw out the stuff that got
		broken. The floor looks clean.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		You need a ride?

<b>				RANDAL
</b>			(looks out door)
		Got one. Just pulled up.

	They stand in silence. Then...

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Do you work tomorrow?

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Same time. What about you?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I'm calling out. Going to hit the
		hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then
		try to see Veronica.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		You wanna grab something to eat
		tomorrow night...after I get out of
		here?

<b>				DANTE
</b>		I'll call you. Let you know.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		All right. Good luck with Veronica.
		If you want, I can talk to her, you
		know, and explain...

<b>				DANTE
</b>		No thanks. I'll take care of it.
		We've got a lot of shit to talk
		about.

<b>									143.
</b>

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Helluva day.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		To say the least.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		Do you need a hug or something?
		'Cause I would have no hang-ups
		about hugging you...you know, you
		being a guy and all. Just don't
		knead my ass when you do it.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		Get the fuck outta here already.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		I'm gone. I'll talk to you tomorrow.

	RANDAL exits. A second later, he reenters and tosses DANTE
	the sheet-sign.

<b>				RANDAL
</b>		You're closed.

	He exits. DANTE pushes the sign over from Open to Closed.

	DANTE climbs behind the counter. He pops the register open
	and starts counting the drawer out. The door is heard opening.

	POV JOHN: DANTE counting out the register, not looking up.

<b>				DANTE
</b>		What'd you forget something?
			(looks up, surprised)
		Oh. I'm sorry, we're closed.

	A gunshot blasts out. DANTE flies back, his chest exploding.
	He stares ahead and slumps to the floor.

	JOHN walks behind the counter, stepping over DANTE'S body on
	the floor, and takes the money out of the register. He grabs
	a paper bag and jams the money in it. He grabs handfuls of
	change, shoves it in his pocket, and then quickly exits the
	frame. DANTE continues to lie on the floor.

<b>	CREDITS
</b>
	Credits end, and the door is heard opening. A customer comes
	to the counter and stands there. He waits, looks around for
	a clerk, looks down the aisles.

<b>				CUSTOMER
</b>		Hello? Little help?

<b>									144.
</b>

	No reply. He looks around again, and glances at the door to
	make sure nobody's coming in. Then he reaches behind the
	counter and grabs a pack of cigarettes. He leaves.
