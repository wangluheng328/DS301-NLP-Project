</b><b>		                   
</b>	                          by
<b>	                     
</b>	                      Chip Proser
<b>	
</b><b>	REVISED
</b><b>	
</b>	April 4, 1985
<b>	
</b>	Registered, WGAw.
<b>	
</b>		     NOTE: Aerial dialogue in CAPS is UHF radio; 
		      plane to plane, plane to carrier.
<b>	
</b>		      Aerial dialogue in small case is ICS;
		      an inter-cockpit system; a live mike,
		      heard by pilot and RIO only. 
<b>	
</b><b>	                             TG1   REVISED  04APR85    .
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	1.  EXT. NIGHT. - THE PACIFIC IS ANYTHING BUT
</b><b>	
</b>	WINDS HOWL. Rain drives horizontal. The sea surges up, 
	nearly to the flight deck of the Aircraft Carrier USS Kitty 
	Hawk. The carrier plunges, driving its bow into a wall of 
	grey water. The deck pitches forward and back, rolls left to 
	right, and yaws in a corkscrew motion. The entire 93,000 ton 
	behemoth rises and falls in the TYPHOON-DRIVEN SWELL. 
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	2.  SOMETHING DROPS DOWN OUT OF THE NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	A ROAR. Silver wings flash by, a cockpit, fiery jet 
	exhausts. A forty ton monster drops at 120 knots into an area 
	the size of a tennis court in a CONTROLLED CRASH. 
<b>	
</b>	2A.  A SHOWER OF SPARKS, A SCREECH OF RUBBER AND METAL as 
	the gear hits the deck. The hook catches the 3 wire and the 
	F-14 TOMCAT is slammed to a halt. It's the scariest thing 
	you've ever seen, the most dangerous maneuver in aviation and 
	just another day at the office for a Naval Aviator.
<b>	
</b><b>	TITLES OVER 
</b><b>	
</b><b>	HARD DRIVING ROCK AND ROLL - THE CARS - RIDE ME HIGH
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	3.  FLIGHT DECK - THE LANDING SIGNAL OFFICER - (LSO)
</b><b>	
</b>	Leans almost horizontal into the winds. He holds the pickle, 
	controlling the landing lights and speaks into a mike. His 
	calm, professional commands belie the extreme conditions.
<b>	
</b><b>			LSO
</b><b>	POWER, POWER...DON'T CLIMB...
</b><b>	OKAY, HOLD WHAT YOU GOT.
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	4.  ANOTHER TOMCAT FLIES OVER THE RAMP
</b><b>	
</b>	It slams in. The pilot hits full power, catches the wire, slams 
	to a stop, cuts his engines.
<b>	
</b><b>	5.  OMITTED
</b><b>	
</b><b>	6.  AIR OPS - BELOW DECK 
</b><b>	
</b>	Lots of scopes and electronic gear. The CARRIER CONTROL APPROACH 
	OFFICER (CCA) watches a blip on radar, reaches for his mike key.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	7.  EXT. THE TWILIGHT'S LAST GLEAMING - (AERIAL)
</b><b>	
</b>	We float like gods, above the storm, above the cloud cover, 
	looking down. From overhead, a probe slides into frame, then 
	a graceful nose. The cockpit sides by, Pilot, then Radar 
	Intercept Officer (RIO) barely illuminated by the orange glow 
	of their instruments. The fuselage gracefully swells to two 
	enormous air intakes, then variable angle wings, swept back 
	for high speed flight. Twin tailbooms cant outward, 
	horizontal stabilizers make constant adjustments. Enormous 
	twin jet exhaust ports glow red in the moonlight.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	8.  INT. COCKPIT - (AERIAL)
</b><b>	
</b>	We become aware of WIND WHISTLE, JET ENGINE SOUNDS, RADIO 
	STATIC. The pilot, COUGAR, is calm, steady. The Radar 
	Intercept Officer in the backseat, GOOSE, is a wildman, 
	always an edge of humor in his voice. A UHF transmission 
	breaks in..
<b>	
</b>			STRIKE (V.O. filtered)
<b>	GHOST RIDER, THIS IS STRIKE... WE 
</b><b>	HAVE UNKNOWN CONTACT INBOUND, 
</b><b>	MUSTANG. YOUR VECTOR ZERO NINE ZERO 
</b><b>	FOR BOGEY.
</b><b>	
</b>	Almost immediately the RIO picks up a target and responds.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b><b>	CONTACT 20 LEFT AT 25, 900 KNOTS 
</b><b>	CLOSURE.
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	8A.  ANGLE - SECOND F-14 - 115 - COUGAR'S WINGMAN 
</b><b>	
</b>	Come in on the cockpit with stenciled name and call signs: LT. 
	EVAN MITCHELL is the pilot, MAVERICK. In flight suit and oxygen 
	mask, we can only see his eyes. they are confident. In his 
	mid-twenties, he is lean, hard, athletic...the archetype fighter 
	pilot. His rear-seater is LTJG. WALTER MERLIN; WIZARD.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b><b>	I'LL I.D. HIM, YOU HOOK 'EM.
</b><b>	
</b>	Maverick peels off to right, to high cover position; 5 o'clock.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	9.  INT. GHOST RIDER 117 - COUGAR'S POV
</b><b>	
</b>	HEADS UP DISPLAY (HUD) glows dimly on the windscreen. Directly 
	in front of the stick, two CRT screens display data. The bottom 
	screen shows a radar sweep. Wedged between the instruments is a 
	snapshot of a pretty young woman with a 2 month-old baby.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	Closing fast. MUSTANG, THIS IS 
<b>	GHOST RIDER ONE ONE SEVEN. CONTACT 
</b><b>	ONE BOGEY, 090 AT 15 MILES, 900 
</b><b>	KNOTS OF CLOSURE.
</b><b>			COUGAR
</b>	Look for the trailer.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	I don't see anything.  MAVERICK, 
<b>	YOU HAVE A TRAILER?
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	10.  MAVERICK'S F-14 
</b><b>	
</b>	Flying in combat spread, 1 mile abeam, higher. 
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b><b>	NEGATIVE, COUGAR. LOOKS LIKE HE'S 
</b><b>	SINGLE.
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	11.  INT. 117 - COUGAR'S COCKPIT
</b><b>	
</b><b>			COUGAR
</b><b>	HANG BACK AND WATCH FOR HIM. HERE 
</b><b>	COMES...MIG ONE.
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	12.  EXT. SKY 
</b><b>	
</b>	Closing at 900 knots, The MiG is a speck, then a flash and a 
	ROAR, a knife-edge pass at 300 feet. It rockets past his left 
	wing tip and disappears. Cougar kicks rudder, whips the stick, 
	screams into a tight turning roll and dives after him. He slams 
	the throttle forward to ZONE 5 AFTERBURNER.  
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	13.  EXT. - MAVERICK'S F-14
</b><b>	
</b>	Maverick sees a SECOND MiG drop from above onto Cougar's tail.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b><b>	BOGEY ON YOUR SIX. I'M ON HIS.
</b><b>	
</b>	Maverick swings after him, lights it. 
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	13A.  ALL FOUR JETS SCREAM DOWN IN A POWER DIVE. 
</b><b>	
</b>	They punch through cloud cover into the soup.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	14.  EXT. COUGAR'S F-14 
</b><b>	
</b>	He is closing on the first MiG when a shocking BLIPBLIPBLIPBLIP 
	tone breaks into their headsets.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	I've got a six strobe.  I think 
	he's locked on us.
<b>	
</b><b>			COUGAR
</b>	It's a MiG 21. They don't have 
	radar missiles!
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	Let's hope you're right!
<b>	
</b><b>			COUGAR
</b>	What is he doing?
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	He's pissing me off!
<b>	
</b>	Cougar swings mad gyrations, cutting back and forth across the 
	front MiG's tailpipe, trying to break the lock-on. The TONE grows 
	more insistant.
<b>	
</b><b>			COUGAR
</b>	Can't shake him.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK (V.O.) 
</b><b>	WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
</b><b>	
</b><b>			COUGAR
</b>	Maintaining course. Straight for 
	Mustang.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	Stay with him.
<b>	
</b>	The tone grows steady, BLIPBLIPBLIPBLIP.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	   (alarmed)
	That's missile lock! 
<b>	
</b><b>			COUGAR
</b>	He better be kidding!
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	Lordy!  Eyeball to Asshole.
	Hope nobody burps!
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	14A.  INT. MAVERICK'S F-14
</b><b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	I'LL LOCK ON THEM, COUGAR. (to himself)  
	Gotcha covered, don't nobody move.
<b>	
</b><b>			COUGAR
</b><b>	I'M UP HERE TOO, MAVERICK.
</b><b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	ROGER, COUGAR. (to himself and his RIO) 
	Okay boys, pull out with your hands up 
	and nobody'll get hurt.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	14B.  INT. COUGAR'S F-14
</b><b>	
</b>	Up front, Cougar checks his gunsight...He gets I.R. lock...
<b>	
</b><b>			COUGAR
</b>	We're locked on MiG ONE. Why 
	doesn't he disengage?
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	These guys are getting on my 
	nerves.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	14C.   FINALLY, MIG ONE TURNS AWAY.
</b><b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b><b>	GHOST RIDER TO MUSTANG. BANDITS  
</b><b>	TURNING AWAY.
</b><b>	
</b>	But Cougar presses forward, and MiG TWO stays on his tail.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b><b>	COUGAR, BREAK LEFT. TRY A HIGH G 
</b><b>	ROLL UNDERNEATH. BREAK OUT THE 
</b><b>	BOTTOM.
</b><b>	
</b>	Anger gives way to discipline. Cougar's Tomcat breaks left, 
	dives into dense cloud. MiG TWO still follows.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b><b>	HE'S STILL ON YOU, COUGAR.
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	15.  EXT. COUGAR - IN THE CLOUDS
</b><b>	
</b>	Still hears the tone, BLIPBLIPBLIP...
<b>	
</b><b>			COUGAR
</b><b>	
</b><b>	I KNOW. I KNOW.
</b><b>	
</b>	He rolls over into wild evasive maneuvers, finally breaks lock. 
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	16.  INT. MIG
</b><b>	
</b>	Breaks out of cloud, looks around, startled.  There is nothing, 
	no F-14. He scans the sky frantically, while rolling the 
	aircraft. ...Suddenly, he feels a presence. He looks straight up 
	and behind him. A few feet away, a TOMCAT slides into position 
	canopy to canopy, an incredible feat of flying. Maverick and 
	Wizard stare at him. Maverick slides even closer, canopies nearly 
	touching. The MiG pilot acknowledges them with a weak wave.  
	Maverick stares for a moment, then flips him the bird. 
<b>	
</b>	The MiG pushes negative G, hard down and away. He heads for the 
	deck.
<b>	
</b><b>			WIZARD
</b>	He's running for it.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Ah, the thrill of victory and the 
	agony of defeat.
<b>	
</b><b>			WIZARD
</b>	Speaking of feet, fuel's down to 
	4.0.  We're gonna get them wet 
	unless we find a Sonoco station.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b><b>	COUGAR, THIS IS MAVERICK.  I'M 
</b><b>	GETTING HUNGRY, LET'S HEAD FOR THE 
</b><b>	BARN. ...COUGAR, WHERE ARE YOU?
</b><b>

	can't even see!

</b><b>	
</b><b>	28.  EXT. FLIGHT DECK 
</b><b>	
</b>	All eyes are on what they can see of the approach of the two 
	planes. Maverick drops him off at the pattern and circles. The 
	LSO watches the approach. The Tomcat drops a wing, straightens, 
	drops the wing, straightens ... the approach of a pilot 
	experiencing vertigo as Cougar tries to satisfy his inner ear.
<b>	
</b><b>			LSO
</b><b>	LEVEL...YOUR WINGS... EASY... 
</b><b>	YOU'RE SETTLING....FLY THE BALL.
</b><b>	
</b>	A wind shear just off the ramp drives the plane suddenly down.
<b>	
</b><b>			LSO
</b><b>	POWER...POWER!..POWER!...WAVE OFF!  
</b><b>	WAVE OFF  WAVE OFF!
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	AFTERBURNERS BLAST, but the Tomcat horrifyingly settles tail-low 
	toward the deck. The deck crew watches in terror as the plane 
	wallows in toward them. The LSO'S turn, take a few steps and 
	throw themselves off the flight deck.
<b>	
</b>	They sail into the night toward the surging seas a hundred feet 
	below, then are caught in safety nets hung off the side.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	28A.  THE PLANE
</b><b>	
</b>	Settles, settles, standing on it's engines, trying to arrest 
	it's downward momentum. The hook raises sparks as it skids across 
	the deck... The plane stops falling and hangs for a moment, about 
	to blast back up, when the hook catches the last wire.. The wire 
	snags it, plucking 45,000 pounds of fuel, metal and men out of 
	the air and slamming it all to the deck. WHAMMMM! Right wheel 
	flies up the deck and over the side...the gear collapses. The 
	plane SCREECHES sideways. The crew watches helplessly as it skids 
	slams into it and comes to rest in cloud of fuel vapor and steam.
<b>	
</b>	The LSO runs up, shouting into the mike. 
<b>	
</b><b>			LSO
</b><b>	COUGAR, GOOSE...COME IN COUGAR! 
</b><b>	SHUT YOUR ENGINES DOWN, YOU'VE 
</b><b>	ARRIVED.
</b><b>	
</b><b>			AIR BOSS
</b><b>	GHOST RIDER! ACKNOWLEDGE!
</b><b>	GHOST RIDER! ACKNOWLEDGE!
</b><b>	
</b>	Crash crew leaps into action. The fire crew is there. The man in 
	the Silver Suit jumps up on the wing and crawls to the cockpit. 
	The figures inside are not moving. He hits the canopy release. 
	The canopy pops open. Silver suit grabs at the rear seat harness 
	release. He screams through his suit's aluminized cloth...
<b>	
</b><b>			SILVER SUIT
</b>	Goose, can you hear me?  Goose!
<b>	
</b>	Nothing for a moment. He's dead! Then the RIO'S helmet 
	moves...His head turns. He tears the mask away from his face, 
	looks up at Silver Suit. His head clears.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	Oh, Hello... Valet parking?
<b>	
</b>	Silver suit is stunned for a moment. He straightens up, his head 
	inclines quizzically. Then it hits him.
<b>	
</b><b>			SILVER SUIT
</b>	Son of a bitch!
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	You will put it up front,
	with the Porsches?
<b>	
</b>	He grabs him under the armpits, drags him out of the plane. 
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	Hey...easy...Take it easy...
	I'm a veteran!
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Goose grabs a passing crewman by the arm.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	Can you check under the hood. I 
	thought I heard a funny noise.
<b>	
</b>	Other crewmembers help Cougar out. He seems stunned, but Goose 
	reacts to his fear with frantic one-liners. He grabs a crew 
	member's radio, as Silver Suit helps him away and looks to the 
	figures of the Admiral and the Air Boss far up on the bridge... 
	He waves to them, does his best impression...Desi Arnaz.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	Lucy...Ricky...I'n Home!

</b>	A moment of disbelief... Then hysterical, tension relieving 
	laughter.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	28C.  FLIGHT DECK
</b><b>	
</b>	Goose spots Cougar being helped out. He pulls away, reaches back 
	into the cockpit and grabs Cougar's snapshot of wife and kid. 
	They lead Goose away as firemen blast the aircraft with foam.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	Is it extra for the hot wax?
<b>	
</b><b>	28D.  BRIDGE  - FLIGHT DECK - AIR BOSS
</b><b>	
</b><b>			AIR BOSS
</b>	Clear the flight deck.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	29.  FLIGHT DECK
</b><b>	
</b>	A TILLIE, a four wheel mobile crane, slams up to the plane and 
	slings its lifting harness. Goose turns to Silver Suit.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	Well...there goes your tip.
<b>	
</b><b>	30.  INT. MAVERICK'S PLANE
</b><b>	
</b>	They have monitored the chatter.

	balls...as...
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	30A.  FLIGHT DECK 
</b><b>	
</b>	The TOMCAT slams onto the deck, clearing the wreckage by inches.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	31.  INT. CARRIER HATCHWAY - FLIGHT SURGEON, OTHERS 
</b><b>	
</b>	Watch as they bring a shaken Cougar past. Goose, eyes wild, 
	waves at Maverick and Wizard, rolling up. They flame out - 
	VVOOOMMMMM! They sit there, immobile, waiting for a tow, looking 
	numb.  Goose does his "stewardess".
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	On behalf of your Captain and your 
	crew, I want to thank you for 
	flying VF101. And next time your 
	plans include the middle of the 
	goddamn ocean in the dead of 
	frigging night, I hope you'll think 
	of Naval Aviation.
<b>	
</b>	The surgeon looks into Goose's eyes.
<b>	
</b><b>			SURGEON
</b>	Stress reaction...
<b>	
</b><b>			XO
</b><b>	
</b>	Check his head.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	   (wobbling off)
	Never mind my head, check my 
	shorts!
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	32.  SICK BAY - LATER
</b><b>	
</b>	Cougar lies alone in the dimness, staring at the overhead.
<b>	
</b><b>	33. 03 LEVEL - BELOW DECKS - OFFICER'S COUNTRY
</b><b>	
</b>	The usual CLANGS, WHISTLES, ENGINES of Navy life sound FORLORN 
	ECHOING through the dim, deserted passage. From the distance, a 
	single figure passes in and out of the glow of the overhead 
	lights. Cougar comes closer, hobbling unsteadily.
<b>	
</b>	He reaches a door, pulls himself erect and knocks on the sign:
<b>	
</b>	Commander Tom Otawoczek
<b>	CO VF 101
</b><b>	STINGER
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	34.  STINGER'S CABIN
</b><b>	
</b>	The skipper works at his desk, responds without looking up.
<b>	
</b><b>			STINGER
</b>	Come in.
<b>	
</b>	He looks up. Cougar stands in the doorway, a strange, dazed look 
	on his face.
<b>	
</b><b>			STINGER
</b>	Cougar, what is it? You should be 
	in sick bay. What are you doing?
<b>	
</b>	He walks over to the skipper's desk. His eyes are glazed, but 
	his jaw is firm.
<b>	
</b><b>			COUGAR
</b>	Thinking of my wife and kid.
<b>	
</b>	A determined movement. Hand to chest.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	34A. OMITTED
</b><b>	
</b>	Something metal hits it, skids across the polished surface and 
	clangs up against the coffee mug: gold wings.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	35.  PASSAGEWAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Cougar comes out of Stinger's room, bumps into Goose, and 
	Maverick. He turns the other way.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	Cougar!
<b>	
</b>	He stops, turns to them. There is nothing to say. Goose hands 
	him his snapshot. Cougar looks at his wife and kid for a moment, 
	then looks up at them. He turns away.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Cougar?		STINGER (O.S.)
	Maverick, Goose...Come in here.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	36.  STINGER'S OFFICE - DOORWAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Maverick appears, followed by Goose. They stand at 
	attention.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Sir?
<b>	
</b>	The Skipper says nothing. Maverick sees the wings on the 
	desk. He enters, walks over, stares down at them. He picks 
	them up. 
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	Don't worry. I'll talk to him.
<b>	
</b><b>			STINGER
</b>	Don't.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	He's a good pilot.
<b>	
</b><b>			STINGER
</b>	I talked a man back once. Three 
	months later, we lost him. It's his 
	decision. Only he knows.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	He's the best you have. He's going 
	Top Gun!
<b>	
</b><b>			STINGER
</b>	Was.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	What?
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>			STINGER
</b>	Was going. (Turns to Maverick.) Now 
	you are.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Me?
<b>	
</b>	Maverick stares at the wings, lost in conflicting emotions.
<b>	
</b><b>			STINGER
</b>	Well, he's going (indicating Goose) 
	and he needs someone to fly the 
	plane.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	Skipper, you can't do this!
<b>	
</b><b>			STINGER
</b>	I didn't do it, he did it himself. 
	Something about a wife and kid. The 
	fact is, he's lost it. He knows it. 
	I know it. You were up there, you 
	know it, too.
<b>			GOOSE
</b>	Give him a break, Skipper. It was 
	raining snakes up there. He'll be 
	alright, soon as all the gorillas go 
	home...
<b>	
</b>	The Skipper stares at Goose, non-plussed for a moment.
<b>	
</b><b>			STINGER
</b>	I know some RIOS are a little 
	wiggy...but you abuse the 
	priviledge! I don't believe I'm 
	going to have to put the two of you 
	in the same cockpit...but there it 
	is! It may be good for the Navy. It 
	might be good for you, but most of 
	all, it's good for me. It'll get 
	you out of my sight.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	But, Skipper, Cougar's been picked 
	for Top Gun...He's the best of the 
	best!
<b>	
</b><b>			STINGER
</b>	Well, you'll just have to make do 
	with him (indicates Maverick).
<b>	
</b>	Goose and Maverick exchange looks.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	Mav's a great flyer but....
<b>	
</b><b>			STINGER
</b>	He's a hell of a flyer. In fact, 
	he's so damn good he might have 
	been picked for Top Gun himself. 
	Except for one thing. (SCREAMS) He 
	just can't seem to follow orders!
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Stinger moves slightly, to stand now, directly in front of 
	Maverick and speak eye to eye at four inches.
<b>	
</b><b>			STINGER
</b>	You just did an incredibly brave thing! 
	What you should have done was land your 
	plane. You don't own that plane, the 
	taxpayers do. I should ream you out for 
	it. But it just doesn't work with you. 
	You're a hell of a flyer. You are maybe 
	...too good. You never really stepped in 
	it yet. So this is your chance. I'm 
	gonna send you up against the best. They 
	are better than you. Maybe they'll knock 
	that shine off your eagle and you'll 
	see, finally, where discipline and 
	teamwork fit it. 
	Maverick hasn't really heard anything but TOPGUN. He snaps out 
	of it.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Sir?
<b>	
</b><b>			STINGER
</b>	That is all. Tell me about the MiG 
	some other time...
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Yes sir!
<b>	
</b>	He snaps off a salute and does an about face.
<b>	
</b><b>			STINGER
</b>	Maverick..
<b>	
</b>	He turns back.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Yes sir..
<b>	
</b><b>			STINGER
</b>	The wings..
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	He looks down at the wings in his hands, slowing walks over 
	places them gently on the Skipper's desk.
<b>	
</b><b>			STINGER
</b>	Gentlemen!
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK/GOOSE
</b>	Sir?
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	His facade cracks just slightly.
<b>	
</b><b>			STINGER
</b>	Good luck.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	37.  INT. PASSAGEWAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Maverick and Goose push through a gauntlet of aircrews. They 
	have become notorious. Guys grab at them...questions...the 
	MiGs?..What happened up there? How close did they get? What did 
	the MiGs do? One word is heard over and over..."TopGun". Goose is 
	left behind in the crowd. Maverick pushes through. He walks 
	fast...faster. Up ladders, around turns, down ladders, through 
	passageways. Faster. He breaks into a trot, then a canter, 
	squeezing past enlisted men, parts lockers, then he breaks into a 
	run...
<b>	
</b><b>	38.  EXT - CARRIER - NIGHT AND STORM
</b><b>	
</b>	A hatch slams open on the side of the Carrier. He's out on a 
	catwalk, instantly soaked, running on rain slicked stairs 
	cantilevered high over the breaking seas. He plunges forward to 
	the bow of the ship, stands on the very peak. He is yelling 
	something. He stands there as the bow plunges terrifyingly into 
	the trough. The water rises like a green mountain, up, up to 
	break just a few feet below him, showering him with spray. The 
	noise is incredible. 
<b>	
</b>	Come around on his face. It is maddened. He raises his fist and 
	punches the night.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	The foaming slope of the wave rushes up, changing color as it 
<b>	DISSOLVES TO:
</b><b>	
</b>	Desert Sand whipping by...
<b>	
</b><b>	39.  MOJAVE DESERT - 1 WEEK LATER
</b><b>	
</b>	A big bike, a real big bike, a turbo...rockets across the 
	desert. Fast. Real fast. Aviator shades low above the handlebars 
	--Maverick. Goose hangs on in back. It cranks faster, pulls 
	closer...ENGINE SCREAMING. It cranks up a notch, it's going to 
<b>	
</b>	explode. It can't go faster, but it does. It SCREAMS HIGHER. It 
	ROARS under, by and away, leaving dust...
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	39A.  THE BIKE - STILL
</b><b>	
</b>	Silence. Just the HISS AND POP OF METAL COOLING. Maverick sits 
	on it, staring out past us. Goose looks over Maverick's shoulder.
<b>	
</b>	We see why. Feet come into the frame. Then the uniform: 
	California Highway Patrol.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	40.  COUNTRY ROAD - NEAR SAN DIEGO

	hypercivil arrogance tinged with awed disbelief. The usual 
	questions are spaced for effect as if he might be talking to some 
	other form of life. Maverick is off the bike, standing at 
	attention. Goose follows more slowly.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHP
</b>	Son. Do you know why
	I stopped you?
<b>	
</b>	Maverick has some good idea how to deal with authority.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK

<b>			CHP
</b>	Well... What   is   it?

</b><b>	
</b>	CHP - A touch of a smile, quickly surpressed.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHP
</b>	License and registration.
<b>	
</b>	Maverick hands them over with his Navy ID. CHP scans them, 
	hesitates a moment over the last, looks up with a touch more 
	respect.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHP

</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Yes sir!
<b>	
</b>	A long pause. Respect in the cop's eyes. He taps the Navy ID on 
	the handlebars...staring at this sincere young man.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHP
</b>	Lieutenant... Is there...
	a Russian attack?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	No sir! But you have to be ready. 
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	The cop nods and stares at him.

</b><b>	41.  EXT. MIRAMAR NAVAL AIR STATION - LATER

</b><b>	
</b><b>	41A.  OMIT
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	The bike is BLURPING... barely going fast enough to stay 
	upright. Maverick cool in shades and campaign cap dorks past the 
	hanger with the sign: FIGHTERTOWN, USA. He pulls ahead. In back 
	of him, escorting with flashers...the CHP. They pull up at the 
	gate. Maverick and Goose salute the guard, hands over their ID. 
	The CHP gets out of his car, leans against the door.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHP
</b>	Lieutenant.
<b>	
</b>	Maverick turns to him.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Yes, Sergeant?
<b>	
</b><b>			CHP
</b>	Remember one thing.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Sir?
<b>	
</b><b>			CHP
</b>	Outside of this gate...
	I...am Top Gun.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Yes sir!
<b>	
</b>	He salutes. The CHP returns a snappy one. He gets back in his 
	car and turns away. Maverick receives his ID and clearance. As he 
	passes through, a couple of pilots in flight suits (ICE AND 
	HOLLYWOOD) stare at him. The taller, dark, cool one speaks in a 
	dry voice, meant to be overheard.
<b>	
</b><b>			ICE
</b>	Uh oh, police escort. This one must 
	be a real killer.
<b>	
</b>	The second pilot grins big at them. Maverick turns slightly 
	stares over his shades at them as he passes. Goose grins back the 
	challenge.
<b>	
</b><b>	42.  AERIAL COMBAT - VIETNAM ERA - F4'S, MIG 17'S - STOCK 
</b><b>	
</b>	The Doors on the soundtrack.  Jets swoop, missiles fire, a plane 
	explodes. Gun camera views of MiGs, SAMS, flak, bombing runs...
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER (V.O.) 
</b>	During the Korean War, the Navy kill 
	ratio was twelve-to-one. We shot down 
	twelve of their jets for every one of 
	ours. In Vietnam, this ratio fell to 
	three-to-one. Our pilots depended on 
	missles. They lost their dogfighting 
	skills.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	F-14's fighting with F-5's. Music becomes current. 
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER (V.O.) 
</b>	Top Gun was created to teach ACM. Air 
	Combat Maneuvering...Dogfighting. 
	Richthofen, Guynemer, Rickenbacker, 
	Galland, Rudel, Bong would envy us. We 
	do just what they did, but we do it 
	beyond the speed of sound. 
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	43.  INT. DAY - TOP GUN ORIENTATION ROOM.
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	VIPER - A tough-looking, confident leader in a blue flight suit, 
	stands before a video-tape monitor. Behind him, on the monitor, 
	the dogfighting continues.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	By the end of Vietnam we upped our 
	kill ratio to thirteen to one. 
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	He turns on the lights. We see his audience in F.G.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	You're here 'cause you're the top 
	one per cent of all naval aviators.
<b>	
</b><b>	THE CLASS 
</b><b>	
</b>	Sixteen young men - eight flight crews - sit at attention. They 
	are trim, fit and confident - high school heroes, college jocks.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER (V.O.) 
</b>	You're the elite, the best of the 
	best. We're gonna make you better, 
	because you're job is damned 
	important. 
<b>	
</b><b>	ANOTHER ANGLE - THE MEN 
</b><b>	
</b>	The camera moves among them. Hold on one of the men; the one who 
	greeted Maverick at the gate, Ice.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER (V.O.)
</b>	With the tensions in the world today, the potential for confron- 
	tation is greater than ever, and 
	carrier pilots will be the first 
	ones there. Air combat excellence 
	is vital.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Ice is not looking at the speaker, but, rather, in our 
	direction. HOLLYWOOD, a blond, good-looking pilot, whispers 
	something to him, and gestures. Ice is getting the lowdown on 
	someone. The camera moves and we see who that someone is, as 
	Maverick enters the frame. 
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	 ...Someone once asked me if 
	training men for air combat made 
	the world less safe--flying loaded 
	guns... an accidental confrontation 
	and so forth...
<b>	
</b>	Maverick feels the stare of the other man and glances in his 
	direction. Their eyes meet. Ice smiles coldly.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	ANGLE - VIPER 
</b>	 		VIPER (Con't)
	My answer is: the dangerous thing 
	is being unprepared. You want 
	trouble, that's what you get when 
	things don't work out, when you 
	can't do what you say you can. When 
	you don't know what you can do. And 
	when your opponents aren't sure 
	either. We are not policy. We don't 
	make policy. Elected officials 
	...civilians, do that. We are the 
	instrument of policy. The tip of 
	the spear. So we had best be sharp.
<b>	
</b>	Maverick has turned to look at Ice. Ice glances back in his 
	direction. Maverick looks at the back of the room where guys in 
	blue flight suits stand. They are the instructors. They look 
	relaxed, poised, mean.  Goose is looking up front...Where Viper 
	has stopped. Goose nudges Maverick. 
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	   (whispers)
	What are you doing?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Nothing...That's McGown...that's 
	Singer, isn't it?
<b>			GOOSE
</b>	Turn around, pay attention. What 
	are you doing?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	    (musing to himself)
	...Just wondering...(turns back) 
	...who is the best.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	He's shocked to find Viper staring right at him, with a killer 
	grin on his face. He's feels caught like a naughty schoolboy.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	Really...    (smiles)
	Ya know. We'd like to know who's 
	best too. That's why we've got that 
	plaque on the wall... with the Top 
	Top Gun crew from each class. You 
	think maybe your name's gonna be on 
	it?
<b>	
</b>	Maverick knows he's in trouble, considers the social 
	alternatives, then tells him the truth.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Yes sir.
<b>	
</b>	A couple of ooo's and aahh's from the guys. The instructors 
	stare the challenge at him. He slides lower in his seat.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	Considering the company you're in, 
	that's a pretty arrogant attitude.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	    (somewhat chastised)
	Yes sir.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	I like that in a fighter pilot.  
	(couple of laughs from the guys) 
	It's okay to be confident. You have 
	to think you're King Kong to want 
	to try to land on carriers. Just 
	keep in mind the other component of 
	success...teamwork.
<b>	
</b>	Viper gathers his notes, the lecture is over.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Yes sir.
<b>	
</b>	Viper turns back for one more thought.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	Gentlemen, this is about combat. 
	Remember, there are no points for 
	second place. Dismissed.
	Viper walks out. Maverick finds Goose looking at him, 
	quizzically. Others mill around the plaque.  A big, friendly bear 
	of a RIO speaks.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>			WOLFMAN
</b>	A plaque?
<b>	
</b><b>			HOLLYWOOD
</b>	It's not the plaque. The winner can 
	get assigned here as instructor. He 
	gets to fight every day.
<b>	
</b>	They move closer to examine the names on the plaque.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	44.  EXT. "O" CLUB - NIGHT.
</b><b>	
</b>	Fast cars in the driveway, fast music blares into the 
	night. It's Wednesday; Animal Night. Maverick, Goose 
	Hollywood and Wolfman walk to the entrance.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	45.  INT. WOXOF BAR
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Loud music, low ceiling, plaques of the squadrons line the 
	walls. A dancer gyrates on stage, largely ignored by pilots 
	talking with their hands. Every pretty girl in San Diego 
	seems to be here. It's a noisy, rowdy place--a "steam 
	releaser" for people under pressure. Nevertheless, there is 
	a control to it all, there are none of the usual bar types, 
	just pilots and Naval Officers.
<b>	
</b>	The Ghost Riders enter. The place is on fire:  a mob of 
	dancers, flashing lights, blaring HARD ROCK MUSIC. Beer 
	flows. Pilots talk flying and hustle girls.
<b>	
</b>	NEARBY - AN A7 pilot stands by the bar. He knows Goose and 
	speaks loudly for his benefit.. 
<b>	
</b><b>			A7 PILOT
</b>	You know the Fighter Pilots motto? 
	It's better to be dead than to look 
	bad.
<b>	
</b>	They grin broadly. Goose replies as they brush past.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	I don't know, Frank, anybody gets 
	off on bombing the shit out of dirt 
	has got to be queer.
<b>	
</b>	Goose exchanges friendly punches with the attack pilots. 
	Maverick's introductions and friendly barbs are drowned by the 
	music. Maverick is a bit reserved. He doesn't move among the 
	crowd as naturally as Goose does. Hollywood and Wolfman drift 
<b>	
</b>	away, searching for quarry. Goose orders beer. He nods toward a 
	TALL YOUNG MAN across the room.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew 
	him at Pensacola. He's damn good.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Is there anybody in the Navy you 
	don't know? 
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	Gotta keep track of the 
	competition.
<b>	
</b>	Goose suddenly reaches out and grabs a guy moving past.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	Slider -- they let you into Top 
	Gun? If you're among the best in 
	the Navy, I tremble for the 
	security of this country.
<b>	
</b><b>			SLIDER
</b>	Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss 
	to get here?
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	The list is long, but 
	distinguished.
<b>	
</b><b>			SLIDER
</b>	So's my Johnson.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	This is Maverick.
<b>	
</b>	Smiles good-naturedly, shakes hands with Mav. 
<b>	
</b><b>			SLIDER
</b>	So I've heard.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	Who's your pilot?
<b>	
</b><b>			SLIDER
</b>	Tom Kazansky.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	    (very impressed)
	No shit. The Iceman....
<b>	
</b><b>			SLIDER
</b>	Mister to you.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	You think you can stay up with us.
<b>	
</b><b>			SLIDER
</b>	I think, yeah, we'll show you a 
	thing or two.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	This is Evan Mitchell, he steers 
	the thing. 
<b>	
</b><b>			SLIDER
</b>	So I heard. Steers it pretty close. 
	Sorry to hear about Cougar. He was 
	a good man.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Still is..
<b>			SLIDER
</b>	Yeah. That's what I meant.
<b>	
</b>	Suddenly, behind them, a flame shoots up. Someone ducks his head 
	and swallows it. The pilot sets an empty glass on the bar.
<b>	
</b><b>			SLIDER
</b>	What was that?
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	Flaming Hooker. Sort of an 
	institution around here. Or maybe 
	this is the institution, I forget 
	which. It's the house drink. It'll 
	warm the cockles of your heart ... 
	and other things depending on where 
	you spill it.
<b>	
</b>	He motions to the barmaid and she moves over, sets them up. 
	GOOSE holds a demitasse glass. The barmaid pours Drambuie. They 
	look at Goose apprehensively. Goose looks at nearby flyers in 
	Camo fatigues.
<b>			GOOSE
</b>	You can't show fear in front of 
	Marines...They're like Doberman's 
	they'll go for your throat, it's 
	instinctive.
<b>	
</b>	He takes out match and lights it. Maverick holds his arm.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	You ever done this before?
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	He downs it all in one gulp, slaps the glass on the bar, still 
	aflame. He stands there, blinking. 
<b>	
</b><b>			SLIDER
</b>	How was it?
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	Could use a dash more jet fuel.
<b>	
</b>	The others are duly impressed. Maverick's gaze falls on Ice 
	watching from the end of the bar - Slider takes one, Maverick 
	takes one too, downs it in a gulp. Sundown, taking up the 
	challenge, motions for one. The barmaid pours it.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	Careful, don't make an ash of 
	yourself...
<b>	
</b>	He tries to drink the flaming concoction. He tries to go for a 
	sip, but it's too close to his face, he tries to tilt the flame 
	away, but that doesn't work. Finally he goes for the gulp. He 
	burns his lip and misses.  He sets his hair on fire. It goes up 
	in a WHOOOSH!!
<b>	
</b><b>			SUNDOWN
</b>	Yeow!
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	Mayday! Down in flames! 
<b>	
</b>	He throws a beer in Sundown's face, quenching the fire. Sundown 
	blinks through the beer.
<b>	
</b><b>			SUNDOWN
</b>	Thanks, I needed that.
<b>	
</b><b>			HOLLYWOOD
</b>	You guys are not only crazy, you're 
	dangerous!
<b>	
</b>	Ice comes up from the end of the bar. He motions the Barmaid for 
	another; it comes. Goose lights it. He gulps it down, cool as 
	hell.
<b>			ICE
</b>	    (Disdainfully)
	Frat boys.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	He walks away. Slider goes after him.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Who is that guy?
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>			HOLLYWOOD
</b>	That's Kazanski.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	No shit! That why they call him Ice?
<b>	
</b><b>			HOLLYWOOD
</b>	Nope. It's the way he flies - Ice cold. 
	No mistakes. Wears you down. After 
	enough time, you just get bored and 
	frustrated, you do something stupid, and 
	he's got you.
<b>	
</b>	Maverick moves in Ice's direction. He passes Wolfman dancing 
	with a girl with bright purple fingernails.
<b>	
</b><b>	ANGLE - DANCEFLOOR.
</b><b>	
</b><b>			GIRL
</b>	Why do you all have such funny 
	names?
<b>	
</b><b>			WOLFMAN
</b>	You gotta have a call sign that's 
	just your own...never changes...you 
	have to recognize it immediately. 
	Then, if someone shouts "Wolf, 
	break left!"..you react right away.
<b>	
</b><b>			GIRL
</b>	Why do they call you Wolf?
<b>	
</b><b>			WOLDFMAN
</b>	   (smiles)
	Oh, I don't know.
<b>	
</b>	Goose comes up with his arm around a girl.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't 
	believe a word I say. Tell her I'm 
	married, will you?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Yeah, he's married--but then again, 
	he,s not dead.
<b>	
</b>	Sally laughs and tries to pull Goose back toward the dance 
	floor. Something in Maverick's eyes makes him hang back with his 
	partner.
<b>	ANGLE - THE DANCE FLOOR - DANCERS
</b><b>	
</b><b>			GIRL
</b>	Could I get a call sign?
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>			WOLFMAN
</b>	Well, I don't know. That depends.
<b>	
</b><b>			GIRL
</b>	On what?
<b>	
</b><b>			WOLFMAN
</b>	Well, it doesn't just happen, you 
	gotta do something famous.
<b>	
</b><b>			GIRL
</b>	Like what?
<b>	
</b><b>			WOLFMAN
</b>	Oh...I'll think of something.
<b>	
</b>	Maverick smiles at this, but seems on edge... He watches a few 
	pretty girls enter and eye the pilots in their flight suits, then 
	turns and walks up to Ice, who sits, drinking with Slider.
	Maverick walks over to him. Ice notices Slider's attention going 
	to Maverick. He turns and grins at him.
<b>	
</b><b>			ICEMAN
</b>	Figured it out yet?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Figured out what?
<b>	
</b><b>			ICEMAN
</b>	Who is the best.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Nope.
<b>	
</b><b>			ICEMAN
</b>	Need a hint?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	I think I can work it out on my 
	own.
<b>	
</b><b>			ICEMAN
</b>	You like to work alone. I've heard 
	that about you. 
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	I've heard of you, too. You were in 
	124 with Bargamian.
<b>	
</b><b>			ICEMAN
</b>	And you were with Cougar. He was my 
	roommate in flight school.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	He's a good man.
<b>			ICEMAN
</b>	The best.
<b>	
</b><b>			SLIDER
</b>	You must have soloed under a lucky 
	star. First the MiG, then you slide 
	into Cougar's place.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	It's not Cougar's place. It's ours. 
<b>	
</b><b>			ICE
</b>	What do you think it was? Was it 
	that MiG contact that did it?
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	Did what?
<b>	
</b><b>			ICE
</b>	Got you here.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	We're here because we're the best 
	flyers in the wing. Not because of 
	some MiG encounter.
<b>	
</b><b>			SLIDER
</b>	What luck! Guys fly their whole 
	career without seeing a MiG up 
	close...You're famous.
<b>	
</b><b>			ICE
</b>	You mean notorious.
<b>	
</b>	Something in the way he says it. It's not quite a joke, more an 
	insult. Maverick's about to take the whole conversation too far 
	when something...someone catches his eye. She catches quite a few 
	eyes in this room. She is very pretty and she's walking in on the 
	arm of a Commander. Maverick turns back, but the moment has 
	passed. Ice dismisses him with a nod and weak smile. Goose pulls 
	him away.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	What do these guys think, I made 
	Cougar quit?
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	Pay no attention to it. They're 
	just trying to rattle you. It's all 
	psychological. Sit down..and drink.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	He deposits Maverick at a chair by a table where other pilots 
	cluster watching and listening to Bugs shoot down his wristwatch. 
	Maverick broods...
<b>			BUGS
</b>	We were just really diving down and by 
	then we were right over downtown 
	Haiphong.  It was some great shit. Jack 
	says, "What are you doing?" "What, what 
	am I doing, Jack?" He says, "What are 
	you doing?" I said, "I'm rolling in, 
	Jack." "Bugs, we're at thirty-two 
	hundred feet. Oh shit, we were like 
	zooom... So we scraped down at hundred 
	feet right over--downtown Hanoi!  Oh 
	shit, goddamn it! And blowing down the 
	river. And so once we were there we let 
	down to about fifty feet just going down 
	the river and Jack says... "Bugs... 
	don't ever do that again!" "Okay, right, 
	Jack, I'll never do that again!"
<b>	
</b>	Maverick pays little or no attention. He broods and drinks. 
	Suddenly, Hollywood nudges him, he turns.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	What, what is it?
<b>	
</b><b>			HOLLYWOOD
</b>	Target passing. Check your six.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Never mind mine. Check hers.
<b>	
</b>	They turn. Long legs, great ass, beautiful.
<b>	
</b><b>			HOLLYWOOD
</b>	Her six is a ten! Uh oh, a turn to 
	engage.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	HIS POV - ACROSS A CROWDED ROOM
</b><b>	
</b>	Maverick sees a stranger, and somehow he knows, he knows even 
	then.  Wolfman turns, sees her walking too.
<b>	
</b><b>			WOLFMAN
</b>	Bogey...9 o'clock level.
<b>	
</b><b>			SUNDOWN
</b>	Nine thirty. Bogey?  You presume 
	that hostile?
<b>	
</b><b>			HOLLYWOOD
</b><b>	
</b>	Well, we should contact and check 
	it out.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	She has turned toward them. She passes by. They start to make a 
	move for her. But just then she finds her date at the bar; a 
	distinguished man with Captain's stripes. Their smiles freeze and 
	they slide back in their chairs. Maverick can't stop looking at 
	her...After a while, the intensity of his gaze draws her 
	attention. She feels him. She is nodding and smiling to her date, 
	but her eyes scan the room like radar. A warning tone goes off in 
	his brain dolu dolu dolu as they lock on him. He feels that 
	thrill of excitement and fear you get when you know you're 
	targeted in someone's scope. Her eyes hold on him for a long 
	moment...long enough, and then sweep by the rest of the room. She 
	turns her attention back to the Captain and laughs at something 
	he says.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Over in a corner, Goose chats up a couple of San Diego girls.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	The family unit -- that's the most 
	important thing. It's the only 
	thing you can count on. I'm married 
	--did I tell you that?
<b>	
</b><b>			FIRST GIRL
</b>	Four times. We don't believe you.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	I've been married since I was 
	eighteen. Why don't you believe me?
<b>	
</b><b>			SECOND GIRL
</b>	Because you don't look married. 
<b>	
</b><b>			FIRST GIRL
</b>	You're not even wearing a ring.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	    (big smile)
	I take it off when I'm chasing 
	women. It's the only honorable 
	thing to do.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	ANGLE - MAVERICK
</b><b>	
</b>	He's half listening to Bugs rattle on.  His eyes are drawn back 
	to the woman. He tries not to stare. She seems to know a lot of 
	people in the club. He looks away. Hollywood is chatting up a 
	girl with a sincerity that cannot be taught. His line is just as 
	polished as his appearance.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>			HOLLYWOOD
</b>	You don't think about death up 
	there, but you think a lot about 
	the danger. One mistake and you're 
	a smoking hole in the ground.
<b>	
</b><b>			GIRL
</b>	I never knew it was so dangerous.
<b>			HOLLYWOOD
</b>	Oh yeah, it makes everything down 
	here more meaningful. You feel a 
	certain intensity of life, and you 
	want to grab onto every moment.
<b>	
</b>	Maverick looks up at the bar again. A shock. She (Charlie) is 
	staring right at him, intensely, as her date whispers something 
	in her ear. She notices him, staring back, quickly looks away, 
	embarrassed. She says something to the man. He nods and turns 
	away as someone else grabs his attention. The woman, now wouldn't 
	look this way for anything. She picks up her purse from the bar 
	and walks through the crowd and out of the room. Impulsively, 
	Maverick's up, he follows. 
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	46.  INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE THE BAR
</b><b>	
</b>	He breaks out, looks around, doesn't see her. Someone disappears 
	around a corner. He moves after.
<b>	
</b>	CORNER - A door slams shut. Impulsively, before he realizes what 
	he is doing, he's through it. 
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	47.  WOMEN'S ROOM. 
</b><b>	
</b>	A feminine GASP!  He should have looked at the sign on the door. 
	The realization of where he is hits him too late. She is standing 
	by the mirror, with her make-up out, looking back at him. He's 
	not quite sure what to do. A hasty retreat would be appropriate, 
	if embarrassing. Ah, what the hell, he is a fighter pilot!  He 
	just walks right over to her...no idea what he will say. She's 
	got her lipstick out, twisting it. She looks over at him with an 
	amused smile.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	Long cruise, was it?
<b>	
</b>	She leans over the sink, puts on lipstick, sees his eyes cover 
	her.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	Anything I can do to help, Lieutenant?
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Lots of things. 
<b>	
</b>	She laughs. He is sort of attractive, but there are other girls 
	in the room, she doesn't want to be too encouraging...She tries 
	not to grin at his embarrassment.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	I'll bet!
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Uhhh...Anything I can do for you?
	She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, 
	but she's instinctively attracted.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	Yeah. Hold this. It might be safer.
<b>	
</b>	She hands him a makeup mirror. Starts redoing her lipstick. He 
	just stares at her...She looks up at him, than back to her 
	warpaint. Finally, when it comes, it is cool and amused.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	Now I know why all the girls come 
	here. They know how horny you guys 
	get. But this...is ridiculous.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	It's not that.
<b>	
</b>	Mock anger. She's toying with him.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	It isn't?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Well, it is. It is that, too.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	That's a big comfort to me.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	I could be, too.
<b>	
</b><b>	 		CHARLIE
</b>	How so?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Save you from a big mistake with 
	that other guy.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	And on to a bigger one with you?
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Yeah, most likely.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	Was there ever a girl who didn't 
	like fighter pilots?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	I heard of one once.
<b>	
</b>	She laughs again, shakes her head...another cowboy! She gently 
	takes the compact out of his hands, snaps it closed.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	I'm really flattered, Lieutenant, 
	but I don't go out with pilots.
<b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Then what are you doing here?
<b>	
</b>	Three pretty blondes enter and look at Maverick quizzically but 
	not without interest.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	I think the question is...what are 
	you?
<b>	
</b>	She tries to keep a straight face as she walks out of the room. 
<b>	
</b>	The other girls look at him expectantly.  A beat.  He just 
	stands there, then realizes he's holding her lipstick. 
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Hi. I'm here to talk about a new 
	concept in cosmetics...
<b>	
</b>	47A.  WOXOF BAR. She returns, spots the Captain, motioning to 
	her.  Maverick enters, goes to the other end of the bar. He 
	orders a drink. It comes. He drinks it, pays for it, moves off 
	toward the door. Someone backs into his path, he moves quickly 
	and bumps into someone else; her. 
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	Sorry.
<b>	
</b>	She sees it's him.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	My fault. Should have watched
	where I was going.
<b>	
</b>	Her hand goes to his collar. She adjusts his insignia. She 
	smiles.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b><b>	
</b>	Where's your wing man? Who's 
	watching your six?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Uh, nobody, I guess.
<b>	
</b>	One final adjustment.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	Too bad.
<b>	
</b>	She breaks the spell abruptly, turns away.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	See you around.
<b>	
</b>	Maverick finds his voice.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Can I walk you out?She turns back to him, a smile.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	I'm with someone. 
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	48.  EXT. "O" CLUB - LATER THAT NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b><b>	P.O.V. - 
</b><b>	
</b>	From a car in the parking lot, we see Charlie and the Captain 
	leave the club. They walk directly toward us and stop. She turns, 
	says something polite...a peck on the cheek. He turns away. A 
	dome light briefly illuminates the interior of the car as a door 
	opens. It rocks slightly as someone gets in. Charlie turns back 
	and walks over, taking her keys out. She opens the door to the 
	car and gets in. 
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	48A.  EXT. CAR - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	She starts the car and pulls away. Suddenly, a figure sits up in 
	the back.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	I thought he'd never leave.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	Yeow!
<b>	
</b>	Startled, she nearly drives off the road. She turns to him, 
	startled.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	You! What are you doing here?
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Everybody's got to be somewhere.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	What if Captain Dawson had come 
	with me?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	It would have been really 
	embarrassing!
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	How did you know this was my car?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Simple deduction. It's fast. It's 
	pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's 
	your color...matches your lipstick.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	That's all!
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	And I asked someone.
<b>			CHARLIE
</b>	You think you're pretty smart.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	I think I'm in love.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	49.  EXT. GUARD GATE
</b><b>	
</b>	She pulls up at the guard gate, a MARINE CORPORAL is on duty. He 
	sees the pretty girl pull up and stop, leans over helpfully.
<b>	
</b><b>			MARINE
</b>	Can I help you, Ma'am?
<b>	
</b>	She smiles even more sweetly.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	I don't know, Corporal. Can you do 
	anything about this lunatic?
<b>	
</b>	The car door swings open. Maverick gets out. The car roars away. 
	He stands in the glare of the spotlight...rocking on his heels, 
	looking across at the guard, who snaps to attention and stares 
	holes in his chest.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	50.  INT. TOP GUN - NEXT MORNING. 
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Two guys in flight suits run down stairs past stencils of MiG 
	kills on walls, then down corridor.
<b>	
</b><b>			FLEX
</b>	Not so fast...my head.
<b>	
</b>	They skid to stop outside a door.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	51.  INT. HANGAR
</b><b>	
</b>	Ground crews work on planes in B.G. Jester in middle of lecture.
	Door bursts open. Sundown and Flex skid to a halt when they see 
	whole class looking at them.
<b>	
</b><b>			JESTER
</b>	Who are you?
<b>	
</b><b>			SUNDOWN
</b>	I'm Sundown.
<b>	
</b><b>			JESTER
</b>	Yeah, right. You're late.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Viper breaks in, indicating Flex.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	And who are you?
<b>	
</b><b>			FLEX
</b>	Flex 
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	Flex...? You don't look like Flex  
	to me. You call that muscle? 
	Doesn't look like muscle. Looks 
	like...Pork.
<b>	
</b>	They laugh. Even Sundown has to laugh, scratching his chest.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	What're you laughing at? You're 
	Fungus.
<b>	
</b>	Stops scratching.
<b>			SUNDOWN/FUNGUS
</b>	Fungus!
<b>	
</b><b>			PORK
</b>	Don't make an issue of it, it'll 
	stick.
<b>	
</b>			FUNGUS (Unhappily)
<b>	
</b>	It'll stick anyway. 
<b>	
</b>	Viper turns away...
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	Now to continue. In this class we 
	will be dealing with F-5's and 
	A4's, as our MiG simulators. 
	Technically the F-5 does not have 
	the thrust to weight ratio of the 
	MiG-21--it also does not bleed 
	energy below 300 knots like the 
	MiG-21 does. The A4 does not turn 
	as well as the MiG-17 but has 
	significantly better visibility.
<b>	
</b>	Maverick looks back to his notes. SFX footsteps...door 
	opening. Viper looks up to back of room door.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	Hi, Charlie. Good, our TAGREF's 
	here. Charlie's the most qualified 
	to get into P subs and curves, and 
	VN diagrams.
<b>	
</b>	Maverick turns to see the TAGREF walk forward.  Maverick 
	stares at her as she passes without acknowledging him. He is 
	surprised, embarrassed.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	Charlotte Blackwood--code name Charlie-- 
	not your ordinary TAGREF. Charlie has 
	her Ph.D. in astrophysics--she's a 
	civilian contractor so you don't salute 
	her...or anything else. Is that clear?
<b>	
</b>	She walks to the front and starts her presentation. She 
	talks about something very technical, arcane. MiG tactics, 
	technology. As the briefing rattles on, Maverick reacts to 
	her. Goose glances over at him. He, too, recognizes the girl. 
	He looks at his partner. Maverick feels his stare.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	Hello, I think I have some new data for 
	you...Now a MiG 21 has a problem with 
	the inverted flight tanks. It won't do a 
	Negative G push over. Even below one G, 
	they risk a flame out. Operationally, 
	they will do a zero to one G only.
<b>	
</b>	A snicker from the audience. She hesitates momentarily, goes 
	on.
<b>			CHARLIE
</b><b>	
</b>	The latest intelligence shows that 
	the most they will do in operation 
	is one....is there something wrong, 
	Lieutenant.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	I don't think you're altogether 
	right...about the MiG, that is.
<b>	
</b>	She stops--some of the pilots look at him. Viper glares.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	I beg your pardon.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	No, I beg yours. But I don't think 
	you're right on that.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	Why not?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	I saw one.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	You saw a MiG 21?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	    (She doesn't believe him)
	Where did you see that?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	It's classified.
<b>	
</b>	Nervous buzz in the room. Viper goes rigid. Charlie can't 
	believe it.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	It's what?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	It's classified. Like Hollywood 
	says, I could tell you, but then 
	I'd have to kill you.
<b>	
</b>	Pork stifles a laugh, the others chuckle. Viper is 
	embarrassed.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	Maverick!!!
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	She stops Viper with a glance.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	It's all right.
<b>	
</b>	She can handle it. She is very cool, not overbearing. She 
	says it calmly. She doesn't want to embarrass him any more 
	than he is, but she has to get the facts straight.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	 Lieutenant, I have a top secret 
	clearance. The Pentagon sees to it 
	that I know more than you.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Not in this case.
<b>			CHARLIE
</b>	    (Flatly.)
	You saw a MiG push negative 4G?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Yes, ma'am.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	Where were you?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	On his six.
<b>	
</b>	Little stifled laughs.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	He was in a 4G Negative dive and 
	you were on his six?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Yes, ma'am, At first. Then I was 
	directly above him.
<b>	
</b>	She stares at him for a moment, then she has him. She goes 
	for the kill.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	If you were directly above him, how 
	did you see him?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	I was inverted.
<b>	
</b>	A real buzz in the room.  Ice laughs audibly.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	You were in a 4G inverted dive with 
	a MiG 21?   (She can't believe it.)
<b>	
</b>	At what range ?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Two.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	Two miles.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Two meters.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Chuckles, barely suppressed. Goose pipes up to deflect 
	attention.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	One and a half, actually. I got a 
	polaroid.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	    (Flatly.)
	Lieutenant...
<b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Ma'am?
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	What were you doing there?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Giving him the bird.
<b>	
</b>	Open laughter. She thinks it's at her. She grows red.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	The what?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	You know. The finger.
<b>	
</b>	He shows her, but she can handle this. 
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	So you're the reason those
	SALT talks failed.
<b>	
</b>	The room breaks into laughter. At him. Now he grows red. 
	Goose puts his hand on Maverick's arm, shakes his head as if 
	to say: "Let it go, pal, she got you". 
<b>	
</b>	She looks at Viper. He doesn't know whether to laugh or cry. 
	He knows there's something here he doesn't control.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	Lieutenant!
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	It's just like he says, sir.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	    (He snaps)
	I don't care!
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	51A. CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE LECTURE HALL
</b><b>	
</b>	She walks away. He runs up and stops her.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Why didn't you tell me you were a 
<b>	TAGREF?
</b><b>	
</b>	She studies him coolly for a moment, like a specimen.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	It never came up.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	You let me make a fool of myself.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	You seemed determined to do that 
	anyway.. Why didn't you tell me you 
	were a famous MiG insulter?
<b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Would it have made a difference? 
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	No.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	What would?
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	You know, I'm assigned to this 
	school. I see sixteen new hotshots 
	every eight weeks. Your attention 
	is flattering, but not really 
	productive. Why don't you keep your 
	mind on flying.
<b>	
</b>	She reaches over and aligns his collar insignia.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	Why can't you keep this straight?
<b>	
</b>	She smiles at him and walks away. Maverick turns, sees the 
	others sizing him up. Most of them grin. Maverick moves down 
	the corridor past the CO's Office. Viper leans against the 
<b>	
</b>	doorsill. He lights a pipe, laconically eyes Maverick. His 
	tone gives away nothing, like an ELINT probe eliciting a 
	response.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	Maverick... Where'd you get that 
	call sign?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Yes sir.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	A good man. Good flyer.
<b>	
</b>	Viper turns away. 
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Yes sir. Thank you sir.
<b>	
</b>	Maverick watches him for a beat, he's been tested, but he's 
	not sure how or why. He turns to catch up with Goose and the 
	others.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. SKY - LATER
</b><b>	
</b>	At twenty-eight thousand feet, the two planes circle each 
	other, going in opposite directions. As they jockey for 
	position, they snap past each other like ends of bullwhips.
<b>	
</b>	The earth spins, the horizon appears and disappears. With 
	each hard turn, Maverick and Goose can be heard "grunting" to 
	keep blood in their brains, to keep from passing out.
<b>	
</b>	The fight is hard, physical, and exhausting. The extreme G 
	forces--6.5--flatten them against their seats, causing their 
	heads to weigh over one hundred pounds. Maverick strains to 
	turn his head and track the other jet as it streaks past at 
	Mach One. 
<b>			MAVERICK
</b>	I've lost him -- where is he?
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	On your six -- coming hard. Four 
	hundred. Losing airspeed! He's on 
	your six and closing fast!
	Hard left! HARD LEFT!
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Maverick jerks the stick left, and the F-14 takes an 
	astonishing turn. Jester ROARS past into a wide arc.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	Great move. Great
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	He should've had me.
<b>			GOOSE
</b>	Take it down. Let's bug out of 
	here. Call for a draw.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	No way. I'll nail him this time. 
	Going vertical.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	THE PLANE EXPLODES INTO AFTERBURNER - rocketing toward 
	space. Jester is left in direct line with the sun, and his 
	canopy is sprayed with a blinding glare. Going ballistic is 
	dangerous. The plane flys like a bullet, obeying the laws of 
	physics, not the pilot's touch on control surfaces. The 
	ballistic call warns other aircraft that he is, for the 
	moment, out of control.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	He's blind -- you got him!
<b>	
</b><b>			JESTER
</b><b>	NO JOY! NO JOY! WHERE ARE YOU?
</b><b>	I'VE LOST SIGHT.
</b><b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	He's out of energy! You got 
	control? Unload!
<b>	
</b>	The F-14 peels over the egg, in a backward dive. It rockets 
	down the outside, gaining energy. Over the ROAR of jets, the 
	SCREAM of the wind, Goose shouts data, but it is muffled, a 
	distant voice in a typhoon. Through the canopy, we see 
	Jester, and he hangs in the air like a sparrow in the path of 
	a falcon.
<b>	
</b>	PILOT'S POV - HUD in windscreen - a diamond in a box. 
	Maverick lines up the diamond with Jester, and we hear the 
	high pitched tone BEEPING.
<b>	
</b><b>			JESTER
</b><b>	WE'RE BELOW THE HARD DECK. FIGHT'S 
</b><b>	OFF.
</b><b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	He's right. We're at ten thousand.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	No way. I got you, sucker. You're 
	going down.
<b>	
</b>	Jester maneuvers, but Maverick keeps him in the gunsight. 
	The BEEPING is louder, faster.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	In the envelope. FOX TWO MISSILE 
<b>	SHOT. YOU'RE GONE, JESTER, DEAD! 
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	    (stunned)
	Goddamn! We beat him!
<b>	
</b>	There is an edge of anger in Jester's voice.
<b>	
</b><b>			JESTER
</b><b>	ROGER FOX TWO. GET YOUR BUTTS ABOVE 
</b><b>	THE HARD DECK. RETURN TO BASE 
</b><b>	IMMEDIATELY.
</b><b>	              
</b>	They are brought up short for a moment, then the thrill of 
	victory gets the best of them. Goose lets out a war whoop. 
	The F-14 sweeps up, rolls into an Immelman..
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	We did it!
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	Look, Ma, top of the world!
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	52A.  EXT. MIRAMAR - LANDING PATTERN.
</b><b>	
</b>	Maverick's Tomcat breaks hard and high, rolls over on its 
	side, wings perpendicular to the ground. Goose sees the world 
	go sideways.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	Ahhh...A little high on the left, 
	don't you think?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Right.
<b>	
</b>	He aileron rolls another quarter turn. Inverted, they pass 
	right down the runway.  Goose looks out and insouciantly 
	watches the world go by at 300 knots, upside down.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	Right. Much better. ...Ahhh...what 
	do you call this?
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	It's a victory roll.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	I wouldn't call it victory.  It's 
	more like...self immolation.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	52B.  INT. CONTROL TOWER 
</b><b>	
</b>	Controllers work. Officers watch the landing activity. One 
	old salt, turns from the coffee machine, a cup of steaming 
	Java microns from his lips. A ROAR. VABOOM! The Tomcat roars 
	over. He yelps as hot coffee flys all over his shirt.

	after a train wreck; nothing but the POPPING of sprung metal 
	and the low GASP of escaping steam. Viper speaks quietly, 
	like a funeral director consoling the living. Makes you want 
	to scream.

	nods 
<b>			VIPER
</b>	Why?
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Maverick is exhausted. It's been a long, rough day. His 
	voice is a horse whisper.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	I had him in view. I was peeling 
	over the egg, into a dive. He saw 
	me when I moved in for the kill. 
	There wasn't any danger...
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	    (to Goose)
	Is that how you remember it?
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	Yes, sir. By the time we could 
	respond, we were diving right into 
	his view.
<b>	
</b>	Viper is not satisfied with the answer, but he moves on.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	The hard deck for this hop was ten 
	thousand feet. Jester, at what 
	point did you call off the fight?
<b>	
</b><b>			JESTER
</b>	Just below ten thousand.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	But you continued to fight.
<b>	
</b>	Another pause, another grudging nod.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	Why?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	We weren't below for more than ten 
	seconds. There was no danger. I had 
	the shot. I took it.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	The rules of engagement are not 
	flexible. They exist for your  
	safety. You will obey them.
	Is that clear?
<b>	
</b>	Maverick thinks about continuing the discussion, but the 
	thought is momentary. He quickly cuts his losses, gives Viper 
	what he thinks he wants...He is just on the cusp of too 
	sincere.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b><b>	
</b>	Yes sir, perfectly clear. I guess

</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	I guess you were. Dismissed.
<b>	
</b>	Maverick and Goose leave the room. Viper looks at Jester, 
	picks up Maverick's fitness report. Doesn't read it, looks 
	back at Jester.
<b>	
</b><b>			JESTER
</b>	I don't know what to tell you,

<b>	
</b><b>

</b>	...If you had to go into combat, 
	would you want him with you?
<b>	
</b>	Jester turns, walks slowly around the room. The walls are 
	lined with pictures; planes and pilots...history. There are 
	MiG killers, attack squadrons, ground personnel...There's one 
	picture of a Phantom in flight with the backseater mooning 
	the camera. Other pictures show carriers, famous flyers,

</b>	Maverick looks up and sees the other two-man team, the 
	victors, waiting on the other side of the net for them. Of 
	course it had to be Ice and Slider.Charlie sits and watches 
	as the game gets immediately out of hand. In moments, 
	Maverick and Ice rotate to forward positions directly 
	opposite each other across the net. Other revelers turn to 
	watch as it degenerates (?) to more than a game. Maverick 
	glances at Charlie. He seems uncomfortable, but irrevocably 
	drawn into the confrontation. She says nothing, but her 
	attitude is apparent. Back to the game: Slider and Goose set 
	them up, as they try to spike the ball in each other's face. 
	The final point...up over the middle. They both go up, 
	Maverick smashes, Ice blocks, but the ball sails away, off 
	his forearm. For the first time ever, Maverick beats him. He 
	looks over at Charlie, she is staring out to sea. She looks 
	back at him and he's suddenly had enough competition. They 
	call for another game, but Maverick turns away...
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	Come on, come on! It's double or 
	nothing.. We're talking twelve 
	bucks American, here.

	clean shot...Maverick makes an 
	aggressive vertical move here, 
	comes over the top and defeats the 
	bandit with a missile shot. The 
	encounter was a victory, but we've 
	shown it as an example of what not

	your wingman. Of course you got 
	killed...and well deserved to. It 
	was a really stupid mistake. In

	up there ten times a day to fight. 
	I'd win at least nine of them. 
	That's all I want to do. It's what 
	I do best. I am real good.  Just 
	give me the jet.

<b>	
</b>	He finishes his beer, then rises.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	Nine out of ten is okay, as long as 
	it's only fun and games. But this 
	isn't about that. This is serious 
	business. It is dangerous up there! 
	At 500 knots, things can change a 
	lot in a second. Discipline is what 
	protects us.

</b>	He signals the bartender and drops some money on the bar. He 
	stretches, looks around.

	still alive to think about it. And, 
	you lost your wingman. That's a 
	cardinal sin...don't ever do it 
	again. You owe Hollywood an apology 
	and you owe me a beer.
<b>

	just the gesture Maverick needed, for he seems to relax from 
	his tension. He sips his beer alone.

	smile that he has practiced on her for years. She sets down 
	the kid.

	backseater, where's the world's

</b>	He looks all around and then down at the kid, hiding shyly 
	behind his mother's skirts. Goose grabs up the kid and zooms 
	him around, a game they've played before, every six months or

	he's babbling.

	As she lifts the suit, something falls out of the pocket.

	sees it, quickly takes it, stuffs it back into his pocket.

</b>	Just good luck.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	Where'd you get it.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Pawn shop. What's to eat?
<b>	
</b>	He roots through a picnic basket.

</b><b>	84A.  MONTAGE - PREFLIGHT ACTIVITY
</b><b>	
</b><b>			VIPER (V.O.) 
</b>	...MiG sweep over the water.  You 
	will proceed down the one-seven 
	-zero degree radial looking for 
	MiGs. You will engage all that you 
	find, destroy them, and return to 
	base. Maverick, has the lead. Any 
	questions? All right, let's go. 
	Move like you've got a 
	purpose....
<b>	
</b><b>	85.  EXT. CLOUD COVER - 
</b><b>	20,000 FT. - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Four F-14's fly in formation over the Pacific, searching for 
	(MiGs). They spot them, engage. The combatants fly scissor 
	patterns, slashing past each other, angling for position.
<b>	
</b>	We hear the VOICES OF COMBAT from the planes, a barrage of 
	information exchanges between pilots and RIO's. Maverick and 
	Ice swoop close together on each other's wing--moving on each 
	other, testing, they glance at each other and nod. The 
	Challenge...the fight is on. Suddenly an F-5 rises up out of 
	the clouds in front of them--Ice has the advantage and rolls 
	in on him.
<b>	
</b><b>			ICE
</b><b>	ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.
</b><b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b><b>	SHIT!!
</b><b>	
</b>	The F-5 sees his pursuers. Goes into a hard left.
<b>	
</b><b>			ICE
</b><b>	MIG'S IN A LEFT. MIG'S IN A 
</b><b>	LEFTHAND. I'M ENGAGING.
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Ice struggles against the G's to bring his nose to bear. 
	They go around into a Lufbery--a tight circle, Ice has the 
	advantage. He is closer to the F-5's tail than the F-5 is to 
	his. But he can't close, can't line up the shot. He grunts 
	and strains as the G force pushes him down.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b><b>	COME OFF RIGHT--COME OFF HIGH--I'M 
</b><b>	IN--I'LL ENGAGE.
</b><b>	
</b><b>			ICE
</b><b>	STAY WHERE YOU ARE. HE'S MINE. I'M 
</b><b>	ENGAGED. I'M IN.
</b><b>	
</b>	Maverick maneuvers close to their left circle.
<b>	
</b><b>			ICE
</b><b>	GET OUT OF THERE, YOU'RE UNSAFE. 
</b><b>	GET OUT OF THERE.
</b><b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b><b>	FIRE, OR CLEAR OUT, ICE.
</b><b>	
</b><b>			ICE
</b><b>	GET LOST!
</b><b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b><b>	YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL --

</b><b>	
</b><b>			ICE
</b><b>	STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, 
</b><b>	MAVERICK.
</b><b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b><b>	YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN. I'M IN.

</b><b>	
</b><b>	MAVERICK - ABOVE.
</b><b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b><b>	ICE, ROLL OFF, I CAN SHOOT HIM.
</b><b>	
</b><b>			ICE
</b><b>	NO, NO, NO, HE'S MINE.
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Maverick is pulling a log of G's, but can't target his 
	weapons, he continues to turn in a hard circle, going round 
	and round without gaining. He can't bring his nose to bear.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b><b>	IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN.
</b><b>	
</b><b>			ICE
</b><b>	NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM.
</b><b>	
</b>	Ice stays.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b><b>	COMING IN.
</b><b>	
</b>	Maverick dives down between the two planes pulling 6.5 G's, 
	exposing his underside to Ice. All Ice sees is belly. 
	Obviously, in this attitude Maverick can't see him.
<b>	
</b><b>			ICE
</b>	    (under breath.)
	Sonofabitch.
<b>	
</b>	He slams the stick hard right in toward Maverick. 
	Ice quickly rolls up right, in front of him.
<b>	
</b><b>			ICE
</b><b>	LOOK OUT!
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Maverick sees him flash into his view. He has to slam the 
	stick forward to avoid collision. He swings by real close. 
	Too close.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	Oh, no!
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	They pass through Ice's turbulence. The blast distorts the 
	airflow to Maverick's left engine. BOOMBOOMBOOM. The engine 
	flames out. Full thrust on the right, engine swings the tail 
	around in a yaw. Maverick slams the stick right to correct 
	but too late.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	Plane's coupling up! Plane's 
	coupling up!
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	The plane couples one yaw to the next--the tail swings 
	around-- which becomes an ever increasing flat spin, like an 
	out-of -control frisbee.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	This is not good!...(Rising panic) 
	We're low!
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Maverick is pinned to the instrument panel by centrifugal 
	force, desperately tries to reach back for the ejection 
	lever--but is falling short by about a foot.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	I'm pinned to the panel.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	Time to go.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	I can't eject.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	The plane is spinning ever faster, out of control. He drops 
	the gear. Still spins. Goose is closer to center of spin--G 
	forces are less. He reaches behind him for the eject handle, 
	starts the eject sequence.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b>	3000 feet. I'll do it.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Go ahead. I can't reach. 2000 feet!
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	85A.  BOOM - A HURRICANE OF WIND AND NOISE
</b><b>	
</b>	The canopy BLASTS away--but is held spinning above the 
	cockpit by the vortex of the sinking jet. Goose glances up at 
	it.
<b>	
</b><b>			GOOSE
</b><b>	1000.
</b><b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Let's go. Eject.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Goose yanks the ejection handle. Things happen in a split 
	second. Goose is fired up and out by the rocket under his 
	seat. Almost instantly he impacts the spinning canopy. A 
	sickening CRUNCH. The canopy is knocked away. Maverick is 
	slammed back in his seat as the ejection seat straps wind up. 
	He is BLASTED out of the plane just before it spins in.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	85B.  TIGHT ON MAVERICK AS HE TUMBLES IN SLOW MOTION
</b><b>	
</b>	He's in shock..the loud THUMPING of his heart, labored 
	breathing, a scream that stays in his mind.
<b>	
</b>	Instinctively, he gropes for straps. He releases the pilot 
	seat, it tumbles away. His chute streams, balloons open, 
	snapping his body like a bullwhip.  He drifts momentarily, 
	then plunges into the sea.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	85C. UNDERWATER
</b><b>	
</b>	His face, distorted in the water; wild eyes, disoriented, 
	choking for air. He reaches out, finds nothing to grab.
	Suddenly, he is yanked hard to the side.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	85D.  SURFACE 
</b><b>	
</b>	The parachute is caught by the wind, and dragged, pulling 
	Maverick along beneath the surface. He is twisting in the 
	water, turning over and over, trying desperately to slip out 
	of the tangled straps. He finally hits the surface of the 
	water and sucks air into his lungs. With the end of his 
	strength, he hits the release snaps and breaks free from the 
	parachute. It whips away like a kite in a typhoon.
<b>	
</b>	The sea is choppy and rough. He struggles as his equipment 
	drags him under. He twists, finds the inflatable raft 
	attached to his harness. Maverick pulls the cord, and the 
	raft hisses open. He pulls his body into the six-by-two foot 
	raft and collapses, completely exhausted. The survival has 
	been almost without thinking: an instinctual physical 
	struggle.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	85E.  TWILIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	Maverick begins to focus on the situation. He stains the 
	water with dye, then sees another parachute floating nearby. 
	Paddling to the parachute, he reaches over the side and 
	begins to pull on the heavy cords that are submerged in the 
	water.
<b>	
</b>	A great struggle. The weight is extremely heavy. Finally, he 
	pulls a body to the surface. Goose. Goose is dead. Maverick 
	releases the parachute and pulls Goose into the raft on top 
	of him. He holds Goose in his arms. His mind shuts down 
	again.
<b>	
</b>	From high above the ocean, we see the debris on the water. 
	An oil slick, pieces of honeycomb titanium, and the small, 
	helpless figure in the raft.
<b>	
</b><b>	DISSOLVE TO:
</b><b>	
</b><b>	86.  EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	Searchlights skim over the black ocean. A brilliant light 
	flashes as Maverick pops a pencil flare. Helicopter blades 
	flick powerfully. The lights of the choppers descend toward 
	the wreckage area, scanning the debris, searching for life. 
	The spotlights find Maverick and Goose in the raft.
<b>	
</b>	The draft from the chopper churns the water. A FROGMAN drops 
	from the chopper and hits with a heavy splashes. He surfaces 
	and swims to the raft as a rescue harness is lowered.
<b>	
</b>	Maverick watches curiously as he starts to examine Goose. He 
	hugs Goose closer and looks threatened.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>			FROGMAN
</b>	Let him go, sir. Take it easy.
<b>	
</b>	He tries to pry Goose free, but Maverick has a death grip on 
	the body.
<b>	
</b><b>			FROGMAN
</b>	Sir! Let him go. It's all right. 
	Let him go.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Maverick glares at the man as he bobs in the water.
<b>	
</b>	Another long moment, then Maverick releases Goose. The 
	frogman quickly straps Maverick into the harness. 
<b>	
</b>	HIS POV. - He watches the lifeless body in the water as he 
	is pulled up and away. He shivers from the cold.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	87.  INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	Extreme CLOSE ON Maverick's face. He is emotionless. His 
	eyes are flat and absolutely without expression. There is 
	complete silence in the room. Then we hear the quiet, calm, 
	probing voice of Viper.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	How do you feel?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	All right.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	Goose is dead.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	I know. I was there.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Not one sign of emotion from Maverick. Not one tone of 
	expression. We see Viper now, and his face is strained from a 
	very long day.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	If you fly jets long enough, 
	something like this happens to you. 
	No one escapes it. It touches us 
	all.
<b>	
</b>	Maverick looks at Viper, and his eyes are very disturbed.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	He was...my responsibility--my RIO.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	My first squadron in Vietnam, we 
	lost eight out of eighteen planes. 
	Ten guys. The first one kills you, 
	but there'll be others--you can 
	count on it.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	No reaction from Maverick. He can't quite face up to that 
	reality right now.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	You've got to put him in the box.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Maverick is watching Viper, but he doesn't have anything to 
	say.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	88.  EXT. CHARLIE'S SPORTSCAR - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	The RADIO plays John Lennon; "Stand by Me". Maverick opens 
	his eyes, doesn't know where he is for a moment.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	...they say you're alright.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	I'm fine.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	This is it, then.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	What?
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	The dark side. The price you pay 
	for all the fun you're having. You 
	knew about it, of course. Didn't 
	you?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	He was a friend of mine. A good 
	guy...great guy. It was my 
	fault.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	That's not what I hear.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	I was flying...my responsibility.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	That's what you get flight pay for.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Maybe I shouldn't take it.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	    (In surprise)
	Why? You act like you didn't know 
	one day this would happen.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Not to me.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	You knew it. You all do. It's part 
	of it. Maybe the most important 
	part.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	88A.  ON THE BEACH - NIGHT AND FOG 
</b><b>	
</b>	Charlie's car pulls up. They get out and walk down toward 
	the water. Maverick seems dazed. She is softly taunting.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Where are we?
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	Where are we? You know where we 
	are. It's called the beach. It's 
	where life first crawled up out of 
	the sea. I come here sometimes... 
	when I feel like crawling back in.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	You don't have to do this.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	Do what, show you a good time?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	I'm not good company. I should be 
	alone.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	I don't think so, but if that's 
	what you want...
<b>	
</b>	They stand there, not making a move.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	No.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	What do you want?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	I want it back.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	What?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Yesterday.
<b>	
</b>	She turns, nods out, past the moon.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	You look way out there. Out past 
	the date line. West becomes East, 
	all things change. You cross the 
	line...today becomes yesterday...or 
	tomorrow, I forget which.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	That's what I want.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	Of course the line's just 
	imaginary. You can cross it twenty 
	times...nothing really changes.
<b>	
</b>	She turns and walks along the surfline.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	On the beach... It's what they say 
	when Navy men retire...He's "On The 
	Beach". I always liked that. I had 
	a picture...in my head... all these 
	old guys wandering around here, 
	looking out into the past.
<b>	
</b>	He walks to the surf, kicks the sand with his bare feet.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	If we knew then, what we know now, 
	we might never have come up out of 
	there.
<b>	
</b>	He turns to her. She just looks at him.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	You don't believe that.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Hardly ever.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	Only when you're depressed. Then it 
	passes.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	It does.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	Everything passes. Immutable law of 
	the Universe.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	He picks up a piece of flotsam, a twig, worn smooth.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	This too...shall pass. You put as 
	much life as you can between it and 
	you. You start piling up experience 
	between then and now.
<b>	
</b>	He turns and walks.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	What do you do when you come here?
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	I sit. I think. I play games.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	What kind of games?
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	I like to play "reality".
<b>	
</b>	She stops and turns.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	How do you play reality.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	It's strip reality, actually, like 
	what the pilots always want to 
	play.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	  (this gets a small laugh)
	Strip reality! How do you play 
	that?
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	It's like strip poker, only, 
	without the bluffing. (he laughs 
	again) One person says something 
	and if the other one accepts that 
	it's true, the one who says it, 
	gets to take one item of clothing 
	off.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	You're crazy. (She stops, he goes 
	on, softer) That's a pretty silly 
	game.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	Not as silly as some. You know the 
	silliest one? ...that we are gods. 
	That we control events on the 
	beach... that we can turn back 
	time...
<b>	
</b>	She moves in close.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	Want to play the game? 
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	How does it go?
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	You say the truth. (a beat...)    
	Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want 
	to win the game, don'tcha?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	What truth?
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	The big one. The one that's most on 
	your mind.
<b>	
</b>	A long pause...it comes hard.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Goose is dead.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	    (she nods)
	True.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Now?
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	Take something off.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Off me or off you?
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	That's up to you.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	He takes the ribbon from her hair. It falls down over her 
	face and shoulders. Now it's her turn.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	It's dangerous...what you do.
<b>	
</b>	He nods. She slowly loosens his tie and pulls it from around 
	his neck.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	It was my fault.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	She says nothing, stands looking into his eyes. He slowly, 
	as if in a trance, takes her blouse off.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	You can't bring him back.
<b>	
</b>	She takes off his shirt.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	It was my fault.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	He starts to reach for her. She pulls back.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	Nope. Already used that.
<b>	
</b>	She turns and thinks for a moment, looking at the moon.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	Your life goes on.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Rather than struggle his T shirt over his head, she grabs it 
	with both hands. She leans in close and bites it. She grabs 
	both sides of the tear and slowly rips it off his body.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	What does it mean?
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	   (shakes her head no)
	That wasn't fair. It was a 
	question. Penalty round!
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	She drops her skirt.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	You didn't mean it. You didn't 
	think. You'd do anything to take it 
	back.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	That's three.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	And that's one!
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	She unbuckles his belt, slowly slides it off. She unzips his 
	pants, they fall.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	One more.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	Your watch.
<b>	
</b>	She unbuckles it.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	You owe me one.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	He rests his head on her shoulder, unhooks her bra. She 
	shrugs it off.
<b>	
</b>	They stand on the beach in shorts and bikini bottom, looking 
	into each other's eyes.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	Looks like a tie.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Who's gonna win?
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	We'll say it together. On the count 
	of three...One...two...
<b>	
</b>	Leaning in, softer and harder...they both jump the gun.
<b>	
</b><b>			BOTHTOGETHER
</b>	I love.ove y.you.
<b>	
</b>	They embrace madly and sink to the sand. From the distance 
	it looks like a strange slithering creature crawling back to 
	the sea.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	89.  INT. GOOSE'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	The lights are out in Goose's room at the Bachelor Officers' 
	Quarters. The door opens, and Maverick enters. He sets a 
	cardboard box on the bed.
<b>	
</b>	Silently, Maverick gathers together Goose's few personal 
	possessions. He fills the box with clothes, books, a clock, a 
	radio, a walkman, and articles from the bathroom. He examines 
	each closely, like an artifact...as if he might find some 
	message or meaning in them. He fumbles them into the box. He 
	can't see too well, his eyes are full of tears.
<b>	
</b>	Maverick closes the box and carries it to the door. He takes 
	one last glance around, then leaves and closes the door 
	behind him.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	89A.  INT. BOQ RECEPTION AREA                      *
</b><b>	
</b>	Carol and the kid, stand, staring at a silent TV. Carol 
	looks dazed, lost. Maverick walks in, finds her. An awkward 
	silence while they both try to think of something to say. 
	Maverick hands the box to Carol.
<b>	
</b><b>	90.   OMITTED
</b><b>	
</b><b>	89B.  CLOSE UP - MAVERICK.
</b><b>	
</b>	He sits staring right through us...the thousand-yard stare. 
	A strange white unreal light washes over him. The only color, 
	the Navy and gold of the stripes on his shoulderboards. A low 
	rumbling mumbling filters through the HISS of surf or fans or 
	something...Snatches of low whispered 
	conversation....disregard of...basic air-safety 
	principles...too aggressive...incident.... 29 July...within 
	performance parameters... disciplinary action...tactical 
	doctrine.... even reckless at times... 
	conjecture...unsupported ...benefit of the doubt...
<b>	
</b>	Maverick's 
	eyes slowly focus. The light attenuates. The surrounding 
	image becomes denser. Things become real.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	89C.  INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - MAVERICK'S POV
</b><b>	
</b>	A BOARD OF INQUIRY, a COMMANDER and other NAVY OFFICERS 
	seated behind tables at the front of the room. Maverick faces 
	them, wearing dress whites. Viper is also present. The 
	Commander looks at each of the Officers. They each nod, in 
	turn, indicating readiness. The Commander turns to Maverick, 
	and states for the record:
<b>	
</b><b>			CDR.
</b>	The Board of Inquiry finds that Lt. 
	Evan Mitchell was not at fault in 
	the accident of twenty-nine July.
<b>	
</b>	No response from Maverick, one way or the other. Viper

</b>	Maverick sits in the cockpit staring at the controls while 
	the ground crew preps the aircraft for flight. Coogan helps 
	him strap in. He speaks solicitously to Maverick. It is 
	unheard over the JET NOISE and RADIO BABBLE. Maverick looks 
	at the cockpit as if it's a strange territory, suddenly 
	foreign to him. He grabs the stick like it's some peculiar 
	talisman. He turns and looks aft. He seems surprised that it 
	moves the control surfaces in the tails.

	afraid.

</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	The bogey abruptly turns into him. Maverick hesitates. Then 
	suddenly, he jerks the stick hard right and takes the F-14 
	away from the bogey at great speed. Fungus is startled.

<b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b>	What are you doing?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Saving them some paperwork.
<b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b>	Since when did you care about  
	paperwork? 
<b>	
</b>	Maverick walks away. Fungus hesitates, then follows him.
<b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b>	If I could fly like you I'd have 
	everything I want. If I could fly

<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	105.  INT. TERMINAL
</b><b>	
</b>	Charlie hurries through the crowd, bumping past people, 
	searching frantically for Maverick in the huge terminal. She 
	moves past bench after bench, and her eyes flick in all 
	directions. A quick glance at the souvenir shop, the coffee 
	shop, and then she heads for the bar.
<b>	
</b>	Maverick is there, sitting alone in a booth with his 
	suitcase beside him, staring into a drink. Charlie composes 
	herself, then walks to the booth and sits down across the 
	table from him. Maverick does not look pleased.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	Never liked fighter pilots anyway. 
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	He looks up trying to be angry, but he can't help it, she 
	makes him laugh.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	You came to the right place.
<b>	
</b>	The waitress comes up.
<b>	
</b>			MAVERICKWhat are you having?
<b>	
</b>	Turns to the waitress.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	I'll have what he's having... 
	Hemlock, is it?
<b>	
</b>	The waitress departs. He tries not to smile, but can't help 
	it.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	You weren't gonna say goodbye?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	I was, later. 
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	Long distance? I wouldn't do that 
	to you. I'd at least talk to you.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	I didn't want to see you. I mean, I 
	did...but I didn't..
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	I know exactly what you mean.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	How could you?
<b>	
</b><b>		CHARLIE
</b>	I've got a gift just like you do. 
	My gift is I just know what people 
	mean, even if they can't say it. It 
	helps when you're trying to 
	communicate with fighter pilots. 
	Like what you just said was "I'm 
	embarrassed, I feel I've done 
	something wrong, that I've failed, 
	and I don't think I can live up to 
	the expectations of a wonderful 
	interesting, intelligent woman like 
	yourself." That about it?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	    (laughs)
	...Something like that.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	And I'm gonna sneak off, and be by 
	myself for awhile, like until I can 
	think of a new career...hotel 
	management or something...
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Big talk for someone who's never 
	been shot off her computer.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	Hey, I never said I was a fighter 
	pilot...I never claimed to think it 
	was fun to be shot off the end of a 
	ship in a storm. I can find 
	contentment in a good book. I don't 
	have to roar by someone at Mach two 
	with my hair on fire. Sometimes...I 
	just get happy being with the right 
	man.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	I hope you find him.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	I think I have... I could be wrong. 
	I have been before. Just remember 
	one thing. If you're not Top Gun, 
	if you're not fighting jets, you're 
	not gonna be able to act like a 
	fighter pilot... You're gonna have 
	to act like the rest of us. You're 
	gonna have to master humility. For 
	you guys, that's the toughest 
	maneuver of all.
<b>	
</b>	She gets up...lays a bill out for the drinks...
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	So long, Sailor. See you on the 
	beach sometime.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	She swings away. Her wake sucks in the stares of every man 
	in the place. Then they look over to Maverick, quick flicks 
	of envy in their eyes. He stares them back and can't quite 
	meet their eyes.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	106.  EXT. BEACH AT VIPER'S HOUSE - LATER
</b><b>	
</b>	Viper is tugged down the beach by a three year old kid. They 
	come across one creature who's had a bad night...Viper spots 
	him, he spots Viper, and Viper moves toward him. Tim, Viper's 
	kid, wants to head for the sea and pulls his father in that 
	direction. He stops, puts his hand on his hips like he's seen 
	the pilots do. 
<b>	
</b><b>			TIM
</b>	Dad...Of all the aminals in the 
	ocean, which one's the baddest?
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	I don't know, Tim. You'll have to 
	ask them.
<b>	
</b>	Viper turns to the creature, Maverick, and shrugs.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	Runs in the family...
<b>	
</b>	Maverick stands up. 
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Skipper, sorry to bother you.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	No bother.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	I called your house.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	My wife's house.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	She said you took your kid to the  
	each. Every second Sunday. Zoo or 
	beach or the ballgame. Y'have the 
	option...(Maverick thinks for a 
	beat. Segues to the question...) 
	What about me?
<b>	
</b>	Viper turns, they stroll together.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	We can send you back to your 
	squadron with nothing noted on your 
	record except "CNC" --course not 
	completed, no explanation required. 
	Theoretically, it doesn't hurt your 
	career, but people always wonder 
	about things like that.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Or....
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	Or you can quit.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>		I don't know...
<b>	 
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	I didn't know either. That's why I 
	told Jester to prepare your papers.
<b>	
</b>	Maverick looks irritated. Viper stops at an icecream vendor 
	and orders three with a gesture.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	You've already made up your mind.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	It's no disgrace, kid. That spin 
	was hell. It would wreck anyone's 
	confidence. You could be a good 
	pilot again someday...
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	    (starts to get his back up)
	You think I should quit?!
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	I didn't say that. That's up to 
	you. But I have responsibility for 
	the other guys up there, not just 
	you. They need to know you're all 
	right...that they can depend on 
	you.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	The vendor hands them icecream, they take it.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Here, let me get this. We'll be 
	even.
<b>	
</b>	He reaches into his pocket for change, comes out with a 
	handful. Slams it on the counter, stars picking the proper 
	change out. Viper spots something and reaches for 
	it...Maverick sees and tries to block it, but Viper comes up 
	with the Navy Cross.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Lucky charm.
<b>	
</b>	But Viper recognizes it for what it is.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	Sometimes it's luck, but in this 
	case, he earned it... I served with 
	your old man.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	I know.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me 
	of him. You're just like he was, 
	only better...and worse.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	I'm nothing like him.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	You may not think so, but you are.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	He was by the book, all the way.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	They waved him off. He thought he 
	knew better. He hit the 
	ramp.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	I never heard that.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	Not something they tell dependents.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	It's not true.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Viper looks at him, for a long beat, throws his icecream 
	away.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	Why would I lie?
<b>	
</b>	He turns, walks away. Maverick stands there for a moment, 
	thinking, then catches up to him, stops him...struggles with 
	the thought...as Viper breaks in...
<b>	            
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	You start on a wrong heading... the 
	more you stick to it, the further 
	you get from your target. A good 
	pilot always questions himself, 
	always questions his judgments, 
	stays alert for drift and makes the 
	corrections...You may find a little 
	discipline helps with the fear. You 
	don't have to be alone up there.
<b>	
</b>	A pause...quiet intensity.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	How can I go on? I feel so... 
	responsible.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	Kid, the plain fact is...you are. 
	I'm not gonna stand here and blow 
	sunshine up your ass. Technically, 
	they absolved you. You and I know 
	what really happened. You pushed 
	it. You are responsible and you'll 
	always carry that. You know what, 
	I'll carry it too. I should have 
	taken you out of that cockpit.
	I guess I'm a hopeless romantic... 
	I always try to find something 
	worthwhile in someone's death. It's 
	no trade-off. It's not one for one. 
	What you learned isn't worth his 
	death. It couldn't be. But maybe 
	there is some value in it. I know 
	it's the first thing I've ever seen 
	that's really gotten to you. Now 
	the question is, what will you do 
	with it. If it gets you out of 
	flight status...so you don't kill 
	yourself or anybody else...that's 
	good. That's one good thing. You 
	were an accident waiting to 
	happen.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	You think I shouldn't fly.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	I didn't say that. That's up to 
	you. I think that if you do, if you 
	choose to come back, you'll be a 
	better pilot... a better man.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Would you take me back? Would they?
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	I'll have to think about it. I 
	don't know about them. I do know 
	one thing, We've got a lot invested 
	in you. We'd hate to lose it. Even 
	more than those other guys, Naval 
	Aviation needs a very few, very 
	good men.

<b>			FUNGUS

	his hand. The party starts to pick up. A real celebration, 
	now. 
<b>	
</b>	Jester enters, a sheaf of messages in his hand. He takes 
	Viper aside for a word. Viper nods at him. The group's 
	attention gradually swings onto them. They quiet down 
	instinctively. Viper finally turns to them.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER

</b><b>	GHOST RIDER,  THIS IS MUSTANG. 
</b><b>	PERMISSION TO FIRE. PERMISSION TO

</b><b>			ICE
</b><b>	ROGER. ENGAGING. I HAVE THE LEAD.

</b><b>	
</b><b>	122A.  INT. MAVERICK'S F-14
</b><b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b>	Let's go! Dive on those bastards!  
<b>	
</b>	Maverick hesitates.
<b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b>	Come on, man, engage. This is it. 
	Get your nose in there.
<b>	
</b>	Maverick hesitates again. He sees the hornet's nest below; 
	planes all over the sky.
<b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b>	Bandit at seven o'clock low--solo. 
	Take him. Pull on the goddamn 
	stick, man!
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Okay, okay.
<b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b>	Don't tell me okay. Do it!
<b>	
</b>	Maverick draws a breath, then forces himself to pull the 
	stick over. The F-14 rolls in hard toward the battle. 
	Suddenly, the cluster breaks apart. The MiGs break in every 
	direction as Maverick BLASTS through their formation. 
	Something comes up through the clouds. A MiG BLASTS by. 
	Another rolls in and locks onto them.
<b>	
</b>	The MiGs swarm toward the TOMCATS, coming from every 
	direction. CANNON FIRE erupts from one of the MiGs.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b><b>	MAVERICK'S EMGAGED. HARD LEFT, ICE, 
</b><b>	PADLOCK THE EASTERN SECTION.
</b><b>	
</b>	The F-14's execute a left oblique turn in unison. They come 
	down in a section attack with their cannons blazing. From 
	Maverick's cockpit, everything looks choppy:  MiGs slide past 
	at incredible speed. Cannons BLAST, as the planes scramble 
	for position.
<b>	
</b>	Out-numbered four to two, Maverick and Ice fight 
	defensively. Maverick has the angle on a MIG, when Fungus 
	spots a missile launch.
<b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b><b>	BREAK LEFT! BREAK LEFT!   CHAFF! 
</b><b>	FLARES!
</b><b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b><b>	BREAKING LEFT!
</b><b>	
</b>	Maverick releases a flare as he takes the F-14 into a hard 
	left. The missile tracks the heat of the flare and sails out 
	of the area, missing the Tomcat and falling toward the sea.
<b>	
</b><b>			ICE
</b><b>	TWO MIGS ON MY TAIL, MAVERICK. I'M 
</b><b>	DEFENSIVE.
</b><b>	
</b>	Maverick jerks his stick right and streaks toward Ice. He 
	cuts off one of the MiGs with CANNON FIRE, driving it down 
	toward the deck. Ice goes into vertical and comes around to 
	gain an angle on the other MiG. His RIO is in position to 
	check Mav's rear. 
<b>	
</b><b>			SLIDER
</b><b>	MAVERICK! SIX O'CLOCK!
</b><b>	
</b>	Maverick turns to look and jerks a hard left. The MiG is on 
	him, CANNON BLAZING. Ice Yo Yos inside and cuts the MiG off. 
<b>			ICE
</b><b>	FOX ONE.
</b><b>	
</b>	He fires a sidewinder. The MiG turns hard, the missile sails 
	away.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>			SLIDER
</b><b>	BANDIT, THREE O'OLOCK HIGH!
</b><b>	
</b>	Ice's F-14 is suddenly caught in a HAIL OF CANNON FIRE as a 
	MiG sweeps down from three o'clock. He breaks, dives. The 
	jets streak across the sky, low to the deck, skimming the 
	surface.
<b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b><b>	ICE'S  DEFENSIVE, HELP HIM OUT.
</b><b>	
</b>	Maverick's F-14 Rollaways in and intercepts the bogey on 
	Ice's tail.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b><b>	REVERSE RIGHT.
</b><b>	
</b>	Ice turns right, the MiG bugs and jerks into vertical.  
	Maverick swoops after him.
<b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b><b>	STAY WITH HIM. YOUR SIX IS CLEAR.
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Maverick closes, jerking left, right, twisting and turning, 
	staying on his tail. 
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	122B.  MAVERICK'S COCKPIT
</b><b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b><b>	ONE ON OUR SIX! BUG OUT! BUG OUT!
</b><b>	
</b>	BULLETS fly by Maverick's F-14 from the MiG on his six. He 
	pulls a hard left, then takes the plane straight up. We hear 
	instructions shouted by Fungus, but it is all obscured in the 
	SOUNDS AND FURY OF THE BATTLE. Maverick peels over the top 
	and comes down like a comet. A series of passes at the MiGs. 
	As they come by, one of the MiGs pulls up, 
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b><b>	OKAY, GOING UP. ICE, GO HIGH. 
</b><b>	
</b><b>			ICE
</b><b>	LOOK OUT! 
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	They look up. An MiG 21 is coming down, belly to them, close 
	to a mid-air collision.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b><b>	JESUS!
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	He pushes down. The MiG ROARS BY. The whole airplane goes 
	"BOOOMMMM" it's that close.
<b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b><b>	OHHHHH SHIT!
</b><b>	
</b>	The shock, the air pressure SLAMS them as it goes by, 
	missing by 4-5 feet. Maverick pulls back in, sees a MiG 21 
	below. It takes off, bugging out. Ice goes after him. The MiG 
	maneuvers, jerking hard left, hard right, twisting  up, down.
<b>	
</b>	Ice is right in his shadow. They come in hard and low over 
	the sea. He has the MiG in the diamond.
<b>	
</b><b>			ICE
</b><b>	GOOD TONE, FOX ONE
</b><b>	
</b>	The MiG starts turning.
<b>	
</b><b>			ICE
</b>	Ah Nuts!
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	The missile goes by the tail.
<b>	
</b><b>			ICE
</b>	Son of a bitch!
<b>	
</b>	Then his tail comes off, the airplane goes over, a chute 
	comes out. The MiG EXPLODES into a thousand small pieces. 
	They roar by the MiG pilot hanging in his straps.
<b>	
</b><b>			SLIDER
</b><b>	JESUS!  HEY SPLASH ONE, SPLASH ONE 
</b><b>	BANDIT! SPLASH THAT SUCKER!
</b><b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b><b>	I GOT ONE HERE. ON THE NOSE.  
</b><b>	COMING DOWN. 
</b><b>	
</b>	Rolling down on him, good SIDEWINDER TONE. The MiG'S sense 
	him, they break, one guy down low. 
<b>	
</b><b>			ICE
</b><b>	ON THE NOSE?
</b><b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b><b>	GOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE.
</b><b>	 
</b>	He squeezes the trigger.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	123.  EXT. THE MISSILE STARTS TO GO 
</b><b>	
</b>	The vapor trail comes off, the MiG 21 turns like he's been 
	bounced off a rubber wall, comes around on the missile, beats 
	it. The missile flies by him. 
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b><b>	AH, SHIT! GODDAMN IT!
</b><b>	
</b>	MiG comes back turning into him.
<b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b><b>	THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!
</b><b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b><b>	I GOT ONE COMING UP.
</b><b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b><b>	AND HE'S GUNNING.
</b><b>	
</b>	He looks back. 30 millimeter tracers go by; they just kind 
	of float. He breaks, hits airbrakes, the trailing MiG dives 
	through.
<b>	
</b>	Suddenly another MiG appears, rocketing straight for him. 
	They close at 900 knots--VABOOOM!--They pass nose to nose, 
	canopy to canopy. Both planes pitch straight up, trying for 
	the altitude advantage.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Zone 5 burners.
<b>	
</b>	The F-14 outclimbs the MiG sitting on its tail, full 
	thruster, it rockets straight up, away from the planet.  
	Maverick has the advantage. Suddenly, his F-14 runs out of 
	energy. FUNGUS is the first to call it.
<b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b>	We're ballistic! Ohhhhhh Shit!
<b>	
</b>	The plane backs down on itself, backs into its own smoke as 
	it flips over, falls away...He catches it, just regains 
	control, when...A ROAR. He looks up.
<b>	
</b>	SECOND MIG coming down. Right on him. It fills the Canopy! 
	Instinctive - A Push to miss him, Maverick breaks fast down 
	into him, a last ditch maneuver, and the airplane 
	DEPARTS...the roll rates and the pitch rates combine and it 
	tumbles over the top; the airplane just goes end-over-end. 
	They are being slammed and rattled all over the 
	cockpits...bone-jarring, neck-snapping whips. SHRIEKS and 
	SCREAMS from the airframe. Terriflying?
<b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b>	Ohhh Mother!
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	    (strangely calm)
	Goddamnit, Mav, you really are a 
	slow learner. Don't worry, Fung, 
	I've got it.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Fungus is getting his teeth rattled. He's helpless, he has 
	no controls, there's nothing he can do but hold on.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b>	Don't WORRY!!!?   You've GOT it!!? 
	Are you CRAZY?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Roger, I've got it. 
<b>	
</b>	The plane's gyrations are rattling Fungus's helmet off the 
	canopy. 
<b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b>	You've got it?   Good!  Cause for a 
	minute there, you had me worried.
<b>	
</b>	It yaws and rolls, starts into a spin.
<b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b>	Now have you got it?  Have you 
	still got it?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Yawing right.
<b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b>	I know!
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Rudder's left, stick's forward.
<b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b>	Swell! Passing ten thousand!
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	I've got it -- hold on!
<b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b>	Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your 
	harness!
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	I can recover. Hold on!
<b>	
</b>	They're in a progressive spiral, nose low.  The altimeter 
	unwinds, speed picks up. The G forces are forcing them away 
	from the axis of spin, jamming Maverick against the 
	instrument panel at the front of the cockpit. 
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	You with me?
<b>	
</b>	Fungus, also, is jammed to his panel.
<b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b>	Right behind you. 
<b>	
</b>	He is closer to the center of spin and less strongly held. 
	It doesn't do much good, however, he can't control the plane. 
	The only thing he can reach is the yellow and black loop; the 
	ejection handle. He reaches for it.
<b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b>	Speed's up to 150. 
<b>	
</b>	Fungus's eyes are wide.  The earth grows larger as it rises 
	towards them. G forces flatten them. They've long since lost 
	the MiG. Nobody but an idiot would try to follow them in this 
	maneuver.
<b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b>	5000 feet. Speed two hundred.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Okay.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	The earth grows larger.
<b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b>	4500. Critical point.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	FUNGUS grabs the ejection handle with both hands.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	No! Not again!
<b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b>	What are you talking about,
		we gotta go!
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	I'm not losing it again!
<b>	
</b>	The jet is standing on its nose, gaining speed, plunging 
	towards the ocean.  
<b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b>	Gotta go, man.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	280, 290, 300 knots.
<b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b>	3,000 feet.  We gotta go, man.  
	3,000 feet, we gotta go!
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	You go. I'm staying with it.
<b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b>	I'm gonna go! THREE...TWO...ONE...
<b>	
</b>	Then, just as suddenly, as he's about to pull...Maverick 
	catches it. The plane responds. They're out of the spin. He 
	gets control. Fungus sits there dumbly, hands on handle. 
	Still not believing...
<b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b><b>	ONE....ONE....ONE...
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	SEA LEVEL 
</b><b>	
</b>	Maverick stops the tumble, pulls the nose up quickly and the 
	F-l4 sweeps into level flight no more than a hundred feet 
	above the deck. He comes up and looks right at Ice. Ice is 
	down low. He comes around, a MiG-21 all over him like a cheap 
	suit. A flick, a whip, and Maverick in perfect position, 
	rolls right in on the MiG. Fungus looks like he just saw 
	Jesus. 
<b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b>	What  in  the  Christ...was that? 
<b>	
</b>	He looks at the Mig target set-up in front of him in awe.
<b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b>	Did you plan that? Was all that 
	something you planned?
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Maverick's acquired the target and is all business. 
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b><b>	ALL RIGHT, ICE. COME HARD 
</b><b>	STARBOARD, THEN EXTEND TO THE EAST. 
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Fungus is still lividly frazzled.
<b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b>	Because...if that was... Next time 
	you tell me first.
<b>	
</b><b>			ICE
</b><b>	ROG.
</b><b>	
</b>	Maverick breaks down, Ice zooms up, breaks in and takes the 
	MiG the other way. Maverick Yo Yo's in, comes right up behind 
	the MiG, as the MiG starts acceleration. 
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Maverick rolls in on Ice and the MiG. 
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b><b>	I GOT A WINDER LEFT, BUT NO GOOD 
</b><b>	TONE ON IT.
</b><b>	
</b><b>			ICE
</b><b>	I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF  
</b><b>	A SHOT?
</b><b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b><b>	I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
</b><b>	
</b><b>			ICE
</b><b>	WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?   SHOOT IT.
</b><b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b><b>	WHEN I SHOOT, YOU BREAK LEFT..3..2 
</b><b>	
</b>	The MiG fires.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b><b>	HE FIRED, BREAK NOW!
</b><b>	
</b>	Ice breaks left, drops flares. The MiG's missile follows the 
	flares. Maverick FIRES. The missile doesn't twitch. It flys 
	right up the tail pipe of the MiG, the canopy flies off, the 
	pilot comes out of it, and then the MiG blows up, We go right 
	through the fire ball. VVVARRRUOOMMM!
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	He's out! We got him!
<b>	
</b>	The MiG rolls into the ground...KABOOM!  They swoop by the 
	pilot, hanging in his straps...He watches them, dumbly. 
	Fungus waves. 
<b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b>	What a dope! Maybe they'll
		give him another plane...and we
		can shoot him down again.
<b>	
</b>	Maverick and Ice join up, light it, stand on their burners 
	and blast straight for the sun.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	MAVERICK'S F-14 
</b><b>	
</b>	Without warning, a triple roll, as the elation hits him.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	125.  INT. MAVERICK'S COCKPIT 
</b><b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b>	What is it? What's wrong?
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Fungus nervously looks around at his circuit breakers.
<b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b>	Is there something I should know?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Just relax.
<b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b>	Is it the plane?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	The plane is fine.
<b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b>	Is it you?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Yeah, I guess it is. We did it! We 
	did it...Damn! We sure did it!
<b>

</b>	   (surpressing a grin)
	...Likes to break at 600, 'stead of

	One time, he came over the deck at 
	two hundred, shakes the shit out of

	off his feet.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	129.  INT. MAVERICK'S F-14

<b>	
</b>	The AIR BOSS burns, but has no choice.

</b><b>	
</b><b>	131.  EXT. 
</b><b>	KITTY HAWK DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Sailors line the deck and search the sky. They crane their 
	necks from their battle stations, sweating into the sun, 
	watching for the approach of F-14's. Someone sees it--he 
	points and SHOUTS. The F-14 appears, and every man stands and 
<b>	CHEERS.
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	132. POV -
</b><b>	
</b>	WE COME SCREAMING IN, 5 FEET OVER THE WATER, throwing up 
	rooster tails behind. WE SPLIT OFF and ZOOM along each side 
	of the carrier, at 100 feet and ROLL IT.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	133.  INT. PRI-FLY BRIDGE--VVVAAAAABBOOOOM!
</b><b>	
</b>	It lifts the Air Boss right off his feet. The walls warp, 
	dust sifts from the overhead. The whole tower just goes BOOM!
<b>	
</b><b>			AIR BOSS
</b>	Goddamn that guy!"
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	134.  EXT. FLIGHT DECK
</b><b>	
</b>	They break at 500 knots. Ice is first down over the ramp, 
	waved in.  The F-14 comes in a little rocky. It bounces hard 
	but grabs the wire, then jerks to a sudden halt. The sailors 
	CHEER AND APPLAUD, throwing fists of victory into the air, 
	straining to get a look at Ice as the crew directs his plane 
	off to the side. Opening the canopy, Ice and Slider unstrap. 
	Stinger and the others are there. Guys are climbing up, 
	climbing all over the airplane. They're already painting a 
	MiG on the side, and they're looking at Ice in awe.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	135.  POV - MAVERICK - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD - AS HE LANDS
</b><b>	
</b>	He catches the wire, the view slams down toward the deck as 
	the plane arrests, then comes up...He releases the cockpit 
	and can hear the ROAR OF THE CROWD...
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	136.  EXT. FLIGHT DECK
</b><b>	
</b>	He swings the nose around past Ice's. Ice's plane is covered 
	in colored jerseys as the ground crew pulls him out. 
	Maverick's plane swings towards the PRI-FLY BRIDGE. Pilots in 
	flightsuits pour from the deck hatch APPLAUDING... 
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	137.  HE CUTS HIS ENGINES AS THE GROUND CREW SWARMS
</b><b>	
</b>	As Maverick and Fungus climb down, they see their wingmen on 
	the deck. Ice is looking in Maverick's direction. His face is 
	inscrutable. Maverick gets mobbed, but pushes over to Ice. 
	They stare at each other for a moment, eye to eye even as 
	they are buffeted by the crowd. Finally, Ice breaks...a grin.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>			ICE
</b>	I guess I owe you one.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	You don't owe me anything.
		We're on the same team. 
<b>	
</b><b>			ICE
</b>	You saved our lives. You did it! 
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	We did it.
<b>	
</b><b>			ICE
</b>	You're a hell of a flyer.
		    (he can't resist)
		You can be my wingman any time.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	    (laughs)
	No. You can be mine!
<b>	
</b>	Now Ice laughs. Nobody's ever gonna win on this one. But Ice 
	smiles at him...It's now a running joke between them.
<b>	
</b><b>			ICE
</b>	Whatever you say, Commander.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	He and Slider snap to and proudly salute. Maverick 
	hesitates, then returns it. As Ice and Slider snap it off, it 
	turns into the pilot's salute, they give them the bird. 
	Maverick and Fungus laugh and return the compliment. 
<b>	
</b>	As they are mobbed by sailors, Maverick is elated to see two 
	familiar figures: Hollywood and Wolfman turn from their 
	battle damaged TOMCAT on the forward elevator as it sinks out 
	of sight below decks.

</b><b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b>	What happened to you?
<b>	
</b><b>			WOLFMAN
</b>	He got our radio, and an engine. We 
	were lucky to make it back.
<b>	
</b><b>			HOLLYWOOD
</b>	Not luck. Skill.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	ANOTHER ANGLE
</b><b>	
</b>	Stinger rushes up, grabs Ice and Maverick in a bear hug.
<b>	
</b><b>			STINGER
</b>	MiG killers! You name it, boy. 
	Sky's the limit. You name it. A 
	medal. Anything you want. Anything.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>			ICE
</b>	MiG killers!  What else is there?
<b>	
</b>	Maverick grins, turns away from them.  He he looks out, at 
	the dying sun glinting over the sea. He thinks how beautiful 
	it is out here! Fungus grabs him from behind.
<b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b>	You hear that? Anything we want. 
	Anything...Well???
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Well what?
<b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b>	What do you want?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	What do I want?
<b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b>	What do you want?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	     (he thinks.)
	Any more MiGs?
<b>	
</b>	Stinger shakes his head no.
<b>	
</b><b>			STINGER
</b>	They don't seem to want to come up 
	anymore. There's nothing on the 
	scopes. In fact, everybody's 
	denying the incident ever happened. 
	So...what is it?  What do you want?
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Maverick turns away, considering the options.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	139.  EXT. FLIGHT DECK - ANOTHER ANGLE
</b><b>	
</b>	Another Tomcat rolls up to park nearby. He looks 
	at the plane. Over the deck LOUDSPEAKER, comes the 
	final call to the F-14:
<b>	
</b>			LSO (V.O. filtered)
	    (a touch of sarcasm)
<b>	OKAY, GENTLEMEN. YOU CAN CUT YOUR 
</b><b>	ENGINES...YOU HAVE ARRIVED....
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	WWHHHEEEEZZZZEEERRRRRUUUUUMMMMMMMMM...
</b><b>	
</b><b>	AS THE ENGINES FADE, SO DOES THE PICTURE.
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	FADE IN - WEEKS LATER
</b><b>	
</b><b>	140.  EXT. DAY - FLIGHT LINE MIRAMAR - TOPGUN
</b><b>	
</b>	Viper, Jester and others walk out of hangar to watch a wing 
	return.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	141A.  EXT. MIRAMAR RUNWAY - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	THEIR POV. Suddenly an F-14 breaks, ROARS in over the field 
	inverted, a hundred feet off the ground.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	142.  FLIGHT LINE MIRAMAR - DAY
</b><b>	
</b><b>			JESTER
</b>	Who's the hell is that?
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	Three guesses.
<b>	
</b><b>			JESTER
</b>	Well, he's in trouble and he didn't 
	even get here yet.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Jester looks over at an admiral, who steps out of a staff 
	car, squints up at the swooping plane, turns, barks an order 
	to his driver, jumps in the car and SLAMS the door, the car 
	takes off.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	143.  EXT. MIRAMAR RUNWAY - DAY - FURTHER DOWN THE RUNWAY
</b><b>	
</b>	MP jeeps - lights flashing, pull out and head for the flight 
	line.
<b>	
</b><b>			VIPER
</b>	Come on.
<b>	
</b>	They head for the hangar
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	144.  OVER THE END OF THE RUNWAY
</b><b>	
</b>	The jet breaks at 500 knots and sets down neatly on the 
	tarmac. The rest of his flight follows in perfect formation.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	145.  EXT. MIRAMAR RUNWAY - DAY - MAVERICK'S JET -PULLING UP
</b><b>	
</b>	He unbuckles his straps, takes his helmet off. He looks over 
	at the approaching caravan.
<b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b>	I think they know we're here.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Let me do the talking.
<b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b>	Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do 
	the talking! 
<b>	
</b>	He stands up in the cockpit, gives a snappy salute.
<b>	
</b><b>			FUNGUS
</b>	Why Admiral....How really good it 
	is to see you!
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Maverick turns away. As he backs down the steps, a jeep 
	screeches up, doors slam open, footsteps.
<b>	
</b><b>			A VOICE
</b>	Who's in charge here?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	I am.
<b>	
</b>	He's answered automatically, but now it hits him. He knows 
	the voice. He turns.
<b>	
</b><b>	HIS POV - CHARLIE, HANDS ON HIPS
</b><b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	Not for long, you keep that up.
<b>	
</b>	He hops down, stands there speechless, grinning happily at 
	her.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	Well?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Well what?
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, 
	you got your MiGs....You're our new 
	Top Gun instructor...Now what?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Oh...I'll think of something... 
	What are you doing here?
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	I live here, remember?
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Right on the flight line?
<b>	
</b>	He's got her on that one. She laughs.
<b>	
</b><b>			CHARLIE
</b>	Everybody's got to be somewhere.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	Maybe your somewhere's with me...
<b>	
</b>	He puts his arms around her. Self-conscious, she pulls away, 
	a little embarrassed to show this on the flight line. He 
	laughs.
<b>	
</b><b>			MAVERICK
</b>	That's okay. I always look forward 
	to a challenge. 
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Now she laughs back and puts her arms around him. She kisses 
	him and now she doesn't give a damn who sees it.
