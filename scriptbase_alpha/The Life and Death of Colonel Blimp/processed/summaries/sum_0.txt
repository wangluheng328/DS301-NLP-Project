Portrays in warm-hearted detail the life and loves of one extraordinary man.
We meet the imposingly rotund General Clive Wynne-Candy, a blustering old duffer who seems the epitome of stuffy, outmoded values.
Traveling backwards 40 years we see a different man altogether: the young and dashing officer "Sugar" Candy.
Through a series of relationships with three women and his lifelong friendship with a German officer, we see Candy's life unfold and come to understand how difficult it is for him to adapt his sense of military honor to modern notions of "total war."
