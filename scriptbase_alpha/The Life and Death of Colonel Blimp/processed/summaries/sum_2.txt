Clive Candy V.C.
has fought in the Boer War and the first world war.
He still believes he can win any fight with honour and maintaining "gentlemanly conduct".
It takes an old German friend of his to point out how much the rules have been changed when fighting the Nazis.
We follow this delightful gentleman through his life and the pursuit of his (various) ideals.
