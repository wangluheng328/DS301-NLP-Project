In 1956 Laurence Olivier is directing a movie and he casts Marilyn Monroe.
And clearly Marilyn is getting on Olivier's nerves because she's difficult to work with, because of her lack of confidence.
But Colin Clark, an aspiring filmmaker Olivier hired to work as an assistant, somehow develops a rapport with Marilyn and convinces her she can do it and she does.
Eventually Clark falls for Marilyn and everyone tells him, there's no future for them.
But he doesn't care.
