</b><b>                      PRINCE OF THIEVES
</b>
<b>FADE IN:
</b>
<b>SUNSET
</b>The glowing orb ripples like a blood-red eye.

<b>BLACK, ROBED FIGURE
</b>A face of the ages. Dark, wrinkled skin. Wizened,
almond eyes. He howls at the sun. His voice ECHOES
across the sky. The Moslem call to prayer.
Hundreds of feet below his tower, a mud-walled city of
minarets and mosques. A human ants' nest. Scurrying to
their devotions.

<b>EXT. TWELFTH-CENTURY ARAB CITY - ESTABLISHING SHOT
</b>
<b>INT. DUNGEONS - SUNSET
</b>Pervasive blackness. Moans of men in pain. Dripping
water. Rats. Filth. The nadir of human degradation.
Bedraggled white men, POWs from the Crusades, caged
together with Arab cutthroats. Jailers wrench two
crusaders from their cell. ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY and PETER
DUBOIS. Their appearance reeks of long imprisonment, but
remnants of their noble heritage still glimmer in their
faces. Peter is so frail he can barely walk.

<b>INT. TORTURE CHAMBER - SUNSET
</b>
A furnace. Torture instruments glow red hot. Chained
victims. A massive INTERROGATOR scrutinizes the two
white men. Indicates a rat-faced lowlife, who points at
Peter, jabbering in Arabic.
<b>                         INTERROGATOR
</b>           He says you stole his bread.
<b>                         PETER
</b>           It is a lie. I caught him
           stealing ours.
The lowlife jabbers some more.    The Interrogator debates.
<b>                         INTERROGATOR
</b>           Cut off the infidel's hand.
The jailers haul Peter to the chopping block.
<b>                                            (CONTINUED)
</b><b>
</b><b>                                                      2.
</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b><b>                       ROBIN
</b>         No!... I took the bread.
<b>                       PETER
</b>         That's not true.
<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         They're not interested in truth.
         You are too weak, Peter. You
         would not live through it.
The Interrogator stares into Robin's eyes.
<b>                       INTERROGATOR
</b>         Sacrifice for the weaker? How
         noble... As you wish... Cut off
         this one's hand as well!... But
         first...
He indicates an Arab prisoner, who is dragged forward.
His struggling hand is laid on the executioner's block.
<b>                       INTERROGATOR
</b>         Show them the courage of Allah.
The prisoner's face braces for the pain. A red-hot
scimitar flashes down. The hand flips into a basket.
Twitching.
Robin is next. His composure fails. He flops to his
knees, crying. The Interrogator laughs. The jailers
unlash the thongs on Robin's hand. They stretch it out,
forcing it down. Robin goes limp, sobbing. Peter
catches his eye... Robin winks.
The scimitar. Drawn from the coals. Spitting flame.
Arcs down. Robin is suddenly galvanized.
<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         And this is English courage.
He hurls his holders aside. Swings upward, driving his
fast into the executioner's throat. Grabs the sword.
Slash. His thongs melt like butter. A jailer leaps at
him. Steaming, the scimitar slices into the man's chest.
Despite his bindings, Peter wrestles the Interrogator.
Knife pressed to his throat, Peter is forced against the
furnace. At the last second, he flips the man into the
fire. Screaming.
<b>                       PETER
</b>         That's for five years of hell.
<b>                                             (CONTINUED)
</b><b>
</b><b>                                                        3.
</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>A jailer aims a scalding blade at Robin's back.
<b>                         VOICE (O.S.)
</b>         Behind you!
Warned, Robin ducks away.    Slams the jailer's head into
the wall.
Peter frees himself, but they are still outnumbered.
While fighting, Robin acknowledges the man who shouted
the warning. An imposing, shaven-headed SARACEN.
Heavily-muscled arms and chest, covered in tattoos. Even
his bald head is ornamented.
<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         You speak English?
<b>                       SARACEN
</b>         The king's own. Set me free.
<b>                         PETER
</b>         No, Robin.
<b>                       SARACEN
</b>         For pity's sake. Mine is a
         sentence of death.
Robin sidesteps, propelling a guard into a pit.
<b>                       PETER
</b>         Don't trust him.
Two more guards attack, yelling fury.    Robin eyes the
curved scimitar.
<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         What I would give for an English
         sword. This is a pruning hook.
A guard swings at him with a giant axe.    Robin slashes...
shears the axe handle in two.
<b>                        ROBIN
</b>         Hmm!   Not bad.
He runs the man through. Peter loses his sword. His
opponent moves in for the kill... Peter grabs tongs from
the fire and smolders his opponent with a backhand.
Commotion outside.    RAISED VOICES and RUNNING FEET.
<b>                       SARACEN
</b>         Free me and I will show you a way
         out.
<b>                                            (CONTINUED)
</b><b>
</b><b>                                                       4.
</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b><b>                       ROBIN
</b>         Why should we trust you?
<b>                       SARACEN
</b>         If you don't, you are dead men.
<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         He makes a point.
The door bursts open.    More guards rush in.
<b>                         ROBIN
</b>         A good point.
He slashes the man free.

<b>                         PETER
</b>         Robin!
<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         Whatever blood is in his veins, he
         does not deserve to die here.
<b>                         SARACEN
</b>         This way!
He beckons them to the back.     A hidden door leads into a
tunnel.

<b>INT. SEWERS - NIGHT
</b>They wade through foul water up to their waists. The
Saracen leads... A snake lashes out for his face. Robin
lops off its head.

<b>                       SARACEN
</b>         You are fast, my friend.
<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         Five years I've waited for the
         smell of free air. That makes a
         man fast.
Guards drop down from above, carrying torches.    Blocking
the way.
<b>                       SARACEN
</b>         You will need to be yet faster.
A narrow opening to their left... they splash through.
Half running, half crawling in the dank water. Fire
arrows land around them. The orange smoke is choking.
<b>                                             (CONTINUED)
</b><b>
</b><b>                                                     5.
</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b><b>                        SARACEN
</b>         Poison air.   Hold your breath.
Flames illuminate the walls, alive with a loathsome mass
of crawling slime. Peter falls. A pursuer descends on
him, thrusting a blazing torch at his face. The Saracen
intercepts the blow. Grabs the man's neck, SNAPPING it
with one mighty twist.
<b>                       PETER
</b>                (coughing)
         Thanks. I misjudged you.
<b>                       SARACEN
</b>         Save your breath.

Gasping for air, they find the tunnel veers steeply down-
ward. A slippery, granite tube. Losing purchase, they
slide headlong. Sharp, rusted spikes jut out from the
walls ahead.
Robin grabs at the walls to break the fall. No use.
They're picking up speed. He turns his sword crossways,
bracing it against the sides of the tunnel, as a brake.
Sparks fly. The sword cuts into Robin's chest... but it
works.
<b>                       SARACEN
</b>         Allah be praised.
<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         Amen, brother.
A bloodcurdling scream. A pursuing guard tumbles down
the sewer chute. The three men press themselves against
the wall. The man hurtles by... is impaled on the
spikes.
A draft of fresh air from the roof of the tunnel. Using
the spiked guard as a ladder, Robin climbs. Removes a
grating.

<b>EXT. ARAB STREET - NIGHT
</b>Robin's head appears... ducks back down, as a squad of
mounted soldiers thunders right over him... he reappears.
All clear. They're outside the prison wall. Robin helps
Peter up.
<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         God willing, we may now be safe.
<b>                                            (CONTINUED)
</b><b>
</b><b>                                                     6.
</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>Swoosh. An arrow pierces through Peter's chest -- fired
from the prison wall. He reels... Robin leads him under
the wall for protection. Shouts of alarm. Soldiers
approaching.
<b>                         ROBIN
</b>         Come, Peter.    We must hurry.
Raising his sword, Peter faces the oncoming soldiers.
<b>                         PETER
</b>         It is mortal.    Leave me.
<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         Hold on to my shoulder.

Peter shakes him off.
<b>                       PETER
</b>         My mother... my little sister.
         Tell them I love them. Tell them
         I died a free Englishman.
Robin looks despairingly to the Saracen.
<b>                       SARACEN
</b>         His wound is by the heart.    We
         cannot save him.
Robin knows it's true. Peter pulls an insignia ring from
a hidden pouch in his clothes. Thrusts it into Robin's
hand.
<b>                       PETER
</b>         Take this to my sister. Swear you
         will protect her for me... Swear
         it, Robin!
<b>                       ROBIN
</b>                (reluctantly)
         I swear it.
Summoning hidden resources of strength, Peter charges at
the oncoming soldiers, brandishing his sword.
<b>                         PETER
</b>         For England.
He fells the first Arab.   The Saracen pulls Robin away.
<b>                       SARACEN
</b>         Come now! Do not fail your friend.
         Make his sacrifice an act of honor.
They vanish into the night. Fighting like a man pos-
sessed, Peter is swallowed in a sea of enemy soldiers.

</b>Robin and the Saracen catch their breath.
<b>                          ROBIN
</b>            Farewell, friend. God speed you

He grins.    This strange man has a sense of humor.
<b>                          ROBIN

</b>Eerie shapes. Weaving. White light on water. The moon
reflected in the moat of a small castle. Towers shrouded
in night mist. Smoke curls from a chimney.
<b>SUPERIMPOSE:   LOCKSLEY CASTLE, NOTTINGHAMSHIRE, ENGLAND
</b>
<b>INT. LOCKSLEY CASTLE - NIGHT
</b>FIRE CRACKLES in an open hearth. Hams and a half sheep
hang, smoking. An old DOG SNORES at the fireside. A
bone clunks on the floor, waking him.
<b>                       VOICE (O.S.)
</b>         Enough of that din, Remus.    I
         can't think.
Licking the bone gratefully, the dog looks in the direc-
tion of the voice... Grey. Proud. Distinguished. LORD
<b>LOCKSLEY.
</b>Seated at a table, wine goblet in hand, he pores   over a
wonderful illustrated Bible. Reading to himself    for
solace and strength. Empty chairs surround the    vast
table. A deep sense of loneliness. He glances     at a
portrait over the fireplace... Robin.
The dog jumps. Hackles rise. O.S. SHOUTS. Locksley
unsheathes a dagger. Obscures it in the folds of the
Bible. The door bursts open. A peasant, ragged,
desperate, KENNETH.
<b>                        KENNETH
</b>         My Lord!   Help me.
He's bleeding from a face wound. Another man grabs him
from behind. Locksley's craggy-faced retainer, DUNCAN.
Older than his master, but still strong, he holds Kenneth
back.
<b>                       DUNCAN
</b>         You must wait... I am sorry you

Steam pours from the nostrils of a black charger. Lord

him.

</b>         Nearby the Gregor Caves.
Locksley reacts -- a hint of fear. They move on...
Ahead, the hillside glows, rimmed in eerie light.
Strange primitive CHANTS, wafted on the wind. Locksley
ties his nervous horse to a tree.
Parting undergrowth, Kenneth creeps forward. Cries out.
He's face to face with the maggot-eaten skull of a goat.
Beyond it, a gruesome host of half-skinned human skulls,
all arranged on stakes. Some male, others with rotting
female tresses, staring eyelessly into the night.
Kenneth turns to run... A hand grabs him.

<b>                       LOCKSLEY
</b>         Steady, man. They are to dissuade
         the faint of heart. Think of
         Gwen.
From the crest of the rise, they peer down into the
craggy valley. A cave opening, ablaze with flames leers
at them like the mouth of hell. Before the cave, a
circle of stones. A miniature Stonehenge.
A medieval orgy. Men and women in masks and loose
robes. Dancing. Drinking. Reveling. Pure carnality.
Lord Locksley and Kenneth watch in horror. Faces ashen.
<b>                       KENNETH
</b>         Druids.
<b>                       LOCKSLEY
</b>         I trusted we were rid of such evil
         a century ago.

An unearthly SCREECH. A creature leaps into the circle
of stones. Grotesque gargoyle head, horns, fur-covered
arms and legs. A living Hieronymous Bosch DEMON. Its
clawed hands slash across a reveler's back, drawing
blood in vicious streaks. The creature tastes the blood.
The reveler is ecstatic.
<b>                       KENNETH

</b>         If it is, I have some Christian
         steel that will test his hide.
He draws his sword. A crucifix sculpted into the hilt.
A girl is dragged from the cave. Kenneth buries his
head.

</b><b>                       LOCKSLEY
</b>         Gwen?
Kenneth nods.
The Demon shrieks, dervishing around GWEN, who  is
carried onto the central plinth stone. A pagan   altar,
the shape of an elephant's head with its trunk  raised. A
masked figure stands at the head of the altar.   The high
priest of the dark rite.
The girl's body shudders as blood-red liquid is forced
down her throat. The Demon's voice is husky and hideous.
<b>                       DEMON
</b>         Come, my virgin flower.
Hypnotized by the creature's voice and snake-like move-
ments, Gwen stretches herself out. A single beam of
sunlight slices through the mist, like a laser. The
first light of the rising sun, it strikes directly on the
altar, tracking down towards the girl's heart. The
Demon's raised talons close in on the white flesh of her
neck. Gwen's eyes are open wide, in a trance. The crowd
of revelers encircle the plinth. Awed anticipation...
A warrior's yell!
Sword raised, Locksley THUNDERS in on his CHARGER. The
terrified crowd parts. The Demon screams like a banshee.
<b>                        DEMON
</b>         Kill him!   Kill him!
The followers throw themselves at   Locksley. He beats
them off. The high priest issues    orders to armed guards,
who run to intercept. One aims a    spear. Locksley hacks
the shaft in half. Cuts men down    left and right.
Reaches the altar stone.
<b>                        LOCKSLEY
</b>         Gwen!   Up, girl, up!
Gwen shakes off her trance. The Demon launches itself at
Locksley. Talons rip flesh from his face. With all his
strength, Locksley hurls the creature down.
<b>                       LOCKSLEY
</b>         In the name of God!
His broadsword swings in a mighty arc. Slices across the
gargoyle's skull. Clean through half the face...
Impossibly, the demon rolls back to its feet.

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>The head is an elaborate mask -- beneath are the yellow
skin, white hair, and burning red eyes of an albino
crone. Screaming vitriol, the hag is unharmed.
Momentarily stunned, Locksley regains his senses, hauls
the girl onto his charger. The guards close in.
Locksley spurs his horse. Rides for an opening.
The masked high priest stands resolutely in his path.
Brandishing a burning branch. The horse is freaked.
Rears. Locksley and the girl are thrown.
Unarmed, Locksley charges the man. Slams him into the
cave wall. The mask falls. Locksley gasps in
recognition.

</b>         I am Mortianna. You will die with

side, Kenneth averts his eyes. Turns to run. Five
masked figures block his way.

</b><b>EXT. ENGLISH SHORE - DAY
</b>A twelfth century French sailboat at anchor.    A cross on
its sail.
A longboat rows to shore. Robin stands in the prow, in
a pilgrim's hooded robe. He gazes at the approaching
land. Unable to wait, he leaps into the surf and wades
to the beach. He kneels, pressing his hands and face
into the soil.
<b>                         ROBIN
</b>         Home.    Thank you, Lord.
Aslan steps from the boat, sniffing the air. The French
sailors keep their distance from him. Robin takes his
hand.

<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         My friend, you have escorted me

A sailor creeps up behind Aslan, club in hand.
<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         I thought you'd say that.
He nods to the sailor, who swings the club down. The
Saracen sidesteps, grabs the man's arm and flips him
into the surf. He turns a cold stare on Robin.

<b>                       ASLAN
</b>         No man controls my destiny.

</b>         If our positions were reversed,
         I would have done the same.

hovel. Children scream and run. A soldier clubs at
them, laughing.
Outside. More soldiers. Some on horses, others on foot,
with leashed hounds. Pillaging. Vandalizing.
Searching.
GUY GISBORNE: An impressive figure on horseback.
Strikingly handsome -- except that one of his ears is
missing. We recognize his face from the Druid ceremony.
He coldly addresses a pregnant woman with a child in her
arms, FANNY.
<b>                       GISBORNE
</b>         You owe the sheriff three bushels

</b>         He died last winter.
<b>                       GISBORNE
</b>         Is that so? We hear he     is very
         much alive. Hiding out     in the
         forest. He probably ran     away
         to escape your scolding    tongue.
The soldiers join in his laughter. Incensed, Fanny
pounds her fist on his legs. Gisborne kicks her down.
<b>                         FANNY
</b>         Norman swine!
A BOY of 12 springs from nowhere, thrusting a hay fork at

While two soldiers grab the Boy, others examine his
hiding place. A secret thatched door, built into the
side of a haystack... a bow and quiver... and a deer
carcass. Gisborne dismounts.
<b>                       GISBORNE

<b>                       GISBORNE
</b>         You have deprived us of a hunt,

Wulf's face.
<b>                       GISBORNE
</b>         The hounds know the scent well.
He tosses his bloody glove to the dogs. They tear at
each other in their effort to rip at the glove.

</b>         Run, boy. Like a deer. Give us

<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         Our races have fought for a
         hundred years to prove that point.
<b>                       ASLAN
</b>         Then I trust it is safer to appear
         as your slave than as your equal.
<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         For an 'infidel' you have uncommon
         clarity of thinking. Yet you
         refuse to tell me about your home
         and family.
<b>                       ASLAN
</b>         Those are my burdens.

<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         You speak my language. You have
         the diplomacy and honor code of
         a nobleman. I ask again, why
         were you to be executed?
The Saracen maintains a moody silence.
<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         So, I must continue with my
         guesswork. You are highborn?
         Probably... You fell from favor...
         Clearly... Why? You broke the
         law? You were a rival for power?
         ... A woman?

</b>The Saracen reacts, almost imperceptibly.
<b>                          ROBIN
</b>            By the Lord, that's it!
Aslan is silent, but Robin knows he's right.
<b>                          ROBIN
</b>            They say there are Arab women of
            such beauty that they can possess
            a man's mind, that he would be
            willing to die for them. Is
            that not so?
Ignoring him, the Saracen stops.      Examines the darkening
sky.
<b>                          ASLAN

No reply.    Aslan unfolds a prayer rug.
<b>                          ROBIN
</b>            Who is she? The Mullah's daughter?
            ... Another man's wife?... That's

<b>                          ASLAN

</b>         Worth dying for.
Robin stands smiling over him as Aslan begins his
prayers... BAYING of HUNTING DOGS... In the distance, the
boy Wulf runs toward them, ducks behind a tree and clubs
the leading dog with a branch. The other hounds close
in... panting with exhaustion, Wulf swings into the
branches. A hound savages his leg.
The soldiers surround the tree. The boy clambers
precariously onto the highest branch... Robin surrep-
titiously steals a crossbow from one of the soldiers'
horses.

<b>                       GISBORNE
</b>         You're not playing by    the rules,

         Perhaps he thinks he's    a game
         bird. Shall we teach     him to fly?
         Cut it down!
The soldiers hack at the trunk.    The tree quivers.
<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         Hold!... I am curious as to what
         manner of creature is so fearsome

Shrouded in his pilgrim's hooded cloak, he approaches
them.

         A truly dangerous animal.
<b>                       GISBORNE
</b>         I advise you to move on, pilgrim.
         This is the Sheriff's land.
<b>                       ROBIN

He glances nervously at Aslan, who's still at his
prayers. The men stop in mid-swing. More surprised
than scared. Gisborne gestures to the largest of them.
<b>                       GISBORNE

The soldier raises his sword. Robin lifts his cape...
the crossbow. Shoots from the hip. The bolt thuds
through the man's armor. He's dead before he lands.

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>Aslan ignores him, lost in his   prayers. Robin lifts the
other arm -- a second concealed   crossbow. WHUMPF! The
bolt flips the dog handler into   the vicious pack. Dead
or not, he soon will be. Robin    unsheathes his sword.
<b>                          ROBIN
</b>            Aslan, get off your damn knees!
            I have four of them cornered.
The Saracen remains head down. Or did we see him steal
a glance? Gisborne signals his men to attack. A wave of
flashing steel.
<b>                          ROBIN
</b>            I hope there's enough of me to
            satisfy you all.
Backed up to a tree, he grabs a branch and kicks out.
Two men fly back. He lunges at a third. His sword
strikes flesh. Robin sidesteps and hurls the fourth
onto a sharp tree stump.
Gisborne thrusts. Robin reacts too slowly.       Blood flows
from his arm. His sword falls.
<b>                         ROBIN
</b>            Aslan!!
Gisborne is on him, sword pressed to his back.      Robin
freezes.
<b>                          GISBORNE
</b>            Well, hooded stranger, allow me
            to know your name before I run you
            through.

A moment of silence... Like lightning, Robin spins,
kicks out Gisborne's legs. Slams one foot on the man's
sword arm, the other on his throat. Throws back his
pilgrim's hood.
<b>                          GISBORNE

He obeys.    Robin raises his sword.
<b>                          GISBORNE
</b>            Please, Locksley! No!
Robin drives the point into Gisborne's rear.      The man
leaps.

Gisborne takes off, colliding with Aslan as he folds his
rug. Reacts in shock at the sight of the strange Arab.
Keeps running.

Aslan examines Robin's wound.   Dismissive.
<b>                       ASLAN
</b>         A flesh wound. Why did you let
         their leader go?

</b>         After six years of the stench of

Wulf climbs cautiously from the tree.
<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         Have no fear, boy.
The boy nervously eyes Robin and the Saracen, fingering
a crucifix around his neck. Runs off into the woods.

<b>EXT. LOCKSLEY CASTLE - NIGHT
</b>Ruins. The moon hovers ominously over the once-proud
castle. Burned to the ground. Gutted and deserted.
Towers demolished. Moat drained. Robin stares, struck
dumb with horror.
The dark courtyard.   Heartsick, Robin stumbles over
debris.
<b>                         ROBIN
</b>         Father!    Hello!
His VOICE ECHOES around the fallen battlements. Aslan
places a hand on his shoulder and points... Suspended
high on a tower wall is a decaying human corpse.


<b>CLOSE - MEDALLION
</b>round the corpse's neck.   The Locksley crest.
<b>                        ROBIN
</b>         Noooooo!
A paroxysm of rage and grief. He smashes furniture.
Slams his fists relentlessly into the wall. Pained,
Aslan looks on.
<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         I should have been here.
Spent, he leans against the wall. In the silence, they
hear an eerie TAPPING. Robin draws his sword... A
hunched, old man emerges, walking with the aid of a staff
... Duncan.

</b>Marked contrast.   A forbidding fortress.   Cliff-like
battlements.

stone steps. A long corridor leads to a guarded oak
door.

He shoves the Sentry aside.

<b>EXT. CASTLE BATTLEMENTS - NIGHT
</b>Torches illuminate Nottingham's face. Chilling cruelty
in Manson-like eyes. Seated, his manicured hand dis-
tractedly strokes a semi-naked girl. She sits at his
feet like a frightened dog. When Gisborne enters, she
covers up.
<b>                       NOTTINGHAM

He smashes his fist into his chair.   She timidly

</b>         Cousin, I trust you justify your

His attention is riveted on a dark niche in the corner of
the courtyard. UNEARTHLY SOUNDS emanate from the black-
ness.
<b>                       GISBORNE

Heavy scorn. The sheriff pats Gisborne's hand like a
child's. The voice from the darkness becomes a loud
CHANT. A wrinkled, monkey-like figure dances INTO VIEW,
wearing a necklace of human fingers. You might think
she was a hundred years old, if not for her incredible
agility. MORTIANNA.

The crone's fingers dart into a bag. Emerge with a
writhing, SQUEALING mass... a PIGLET. A knife flashes.
Blood spurts into an ornate, sacred platter.
The girl flinches in horror. Mortianna shakes the con-
tents of a pouch across the bloody dish. Carved bone
dice -- Runes.
She rattles the platter. The rune symbols dance in
trails of blood. Eyes vacant, mouth frothing, she hisses
out her incoherent visions. Nottingham follows her every
move. A connoisseur.

again. Again the grinning skull.

Defends himself as the attacker slashes at the horns.

horns get shorter. Robin retreats.
Left with just the nubs, Robin hurls the deer head at
the mask. Gaining advantage, he charges. Grabs the
dagger hand, smashes it into the wall. The knife drops.
Robin wrenches off the mask.
Long hair tumbles down... a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN.
The front door CAVES IN. Aslan stumbles through... just

crotch. Robin folds. The battle is over. The young
woman stands over Robin.

Robin hands her Peter's ring.   She is shocked.
<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         Marian, I'm sorry.

<b>                       MARIAN
</b>         I will forward your condolences
         to my mother.
She turns her back.   He searches for a way to reach her.
<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         On my return, I found my father
         dead. The Sheriff denounced him
         as a Druid and took our lands.
<b>                       MARIAN
</b>         The people fear the Druids so much
         they'd believe anything.
         Nottingham would have me burned at
         the stake as a witch if he thought
         he could possess my property.

<b>                       MARIAN
</b>         My brother is dead. You cannot

Robin grabs and holds her.

         him.
<b>                       MARIAN
</b>         What do you want?
Their eyes meet... a sudden intimacy between them. Robin
moves closer. Marian begins to respond, then pulls away.

<b>                       MARIAN
</b>         This is wrong.
She runs back to the house. Robin stares after her.
Aslan appears in the doorway with Duncan.
<b>                       ASLAN
</b>         Robin! The old man hears horses.
         Approaching fast.
He runs to a bluff... a column of soldiers snakes up the
hillside.
<b>                       ASLAN
</b>         Twenty or more. In battle armor.

Aslan runs into the stables.
<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         I'm not leaving.
Marian ices him with a glare. Aslan reappears, with two
bareback horses. Soldiers appear on the crest, led by
Gisborne... With a mischievous grin, Marian runs to the
soldiers.
<b>                        MARIAN

<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         Damn the girl! Aslan, can you
         ride?
In answer, Aslan grins. Leaps onto a horse. With a
single swift move he hoists Duncan up behind him and digs
in his heels. The mare leaps forward, and over the
estate wall.
<b>                        ROBIN
</b>         He can ride.
He heads his horse at the wall. It stumbles. Barely
clears it. Stones fly. Robin struggles to hold on.
Marian stands directly in Gisborne's path.

                (to his men)
         A crown to the man who brings me
         Locksley's head.
He leads the pursuit.   A SOLDIER hangs back.   Grabs
Marian's hair.
<b>                       SOLDIER
</b>         A kiss for me, Saxon bitch.
<b>                        MARIAN
</b>         Kiss this!

She unsheathes the dagger from under her skirt.    Jabs
the blade into his wrist.
<b>                       MARIAN
</b>         Try me again, if you want to
         leave a hand behind.
Shocked and pained, the man gallops away. Marian looks
down at her dagger hand. It shakes violently.
<b>                                           CUT TO:
</b><b>EXT. STREAM
</b>Water erupts under hooves. Aslan fords a stream. Duncan
hangs on for dear life. Robin strives to keep up. Half
a mile behind Gisborne splits up his men.
Trying for a short cut, Robin finds himself at the
steepest part of the river gorge. His horse balks at the
drop. Robin flails at his mount with hands and feet. It
backs away.
<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         Damn you, animal!
Aslan shouts from the far bank.
<b>                       ASLAN
</b>         Treat it like a woman.
Robin continues to hit his horse and hurl abuse. Closing
in, the soldiers unfurl their crossbows. A flight of
BOLTS WHISTLES ominously close to Robin. He must jump or
die.
<b>                       ASLAN
</b>         Have you never had a woman?
         Gently, man. Soothe it!

He pats the horse soothingly.    The animal edges forward.
<b>                        ASLAN
</b>         Softly.   With your knees.
<b>                        ROBIN
</b>         I know!   I know!
The soldiers reload.   Robin urges the horse at the steep
drop.

<b>                         ROBIN
</b>         Easy, easy.
Another wave of crossbow bolts. Robin launches the
frightened animal into space. Hooves flail... touch
down. Scramble up the other bank. Robin
enthusiastically pats the horse's neck.
<b>                         ROBIN
</b>         I love you!
The first two pursuers misjudge their leaps.     Their
mounts land sprawling in the riverbed.

            Come, Robin! He is trying to
            anger you into a trap.
A shaft pierces the flank of Robin's horse. It rears in
fright. Robin clings on. Six soldiers, the men Gisborne
split off, are climbing the embankment towards him.
Robin regains control. Rides right at them. Scatters
them, and takes off again. Gisborne yells at his men to
follow.

Robin and Aslan ride flat out. Open land turns to scrub.
Seeing no followers, Robin pulls up and dismounts.
<b>                          ROBIN
</b>            We have lost them. I'll lame this
            mare if I ask her to go any farther.
He gently extracts the shaft from his horse. Aslan opens
his pouch. Pulls out two shiny clear pebbles and a square
leather hide. Rolls the pebbles into the tube and holds
it to his eye. A primitive telescope.
Robin watches, curious.

<b>SCOPE POV
</b>Through the scope we see the movement on the hill behind
them.


<b>BACK TO SCENE

realizes they are still in the distance.

         kind ever take Jerusalem?

Aslan laughs.   Robin points towards an endless expanse of
trees.
<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         We can lose them in the forest.

</b>         Either we take our chances
         with the ghosts, or become
         ghosts ourselves.
He remounts. They race into the trees. Gisborne's men
thunder up,... slowing as they enter the forest. Peering
around them in trepidation, they slowly rein in. Robin
looks back.
<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         They're not following.

Gisborne curses his men, urging them on.
<b>                       GISBORNE
</b>         Come on, damn you! There are
         only three of them.

Eerie HOWLING and RATTLING of bones.    Aslan draws his
sword.
<b>                       DUNCAN

WIND GUSTS the trees in angry waves. Emits deathly
SHRIEKS. The HORSES WHINNEY. Unnerved, Aslan smites
around him with his scimitar. Wheels at the sounds,
striking only air.
<b>                       ASLAN

Duncan clings to his back.   Robin points.
<b>                        ROBIN
</b>         Behind you!
Aslan slashes out, futilely.
<b>                         ROBIN
</b>         No, there!    And there!
Aslan flails.   Robin cracks up.
<b>                       ASLAN
</b>         Cease your mad laughing.     I can
         feel them.
Robin reaches into the branches. Pulls out a string of
hollowed wooden tubes -- WINDCHIMES. Dozens of such
strings on all the trees. He blows over the hollow end.
A low chilling MOAN.
<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         Here are your ghosts, Duncan. A
         child's toy put to good use. You
         scare easily, my painted Saladin.
His laughter is broken by a piercing YELL. A red-
jacketed figure swings down out of a tree on a rope.
Catapults him to the ground.
The bushes are instantly alive. Shaggy, wild-eyed men,
armed with cudgels, scythes and hayforks. Twelfth-
century Hell's Angels. The red-jacketed young turk, WILL
SCARLET, leaps around Robin.

</b>The woodsmen eye the bizarre stranger, keeping their
distance from him. Will kicks at Robin, who tries to
grab him. Will skips out of range. Robin falls.

Robin looks up... I mean up! A towering figure. Seven
feet of grinning, muscled brute. The giant extends a
vice that passes for a hand. Hauls Robin to his feet.
His eyes twinkle with merriment. His whole body shakes
when he laughs, which is often.

CLINKS. Robin's father's medallion. Laughing heartily,
Little rips it from Robin's neck and tosses it to Scarlet.

Bends it into a pretzel.

Aslan shrugs. Robin swings a fist into the giant's gut.
John doesn't flinch. Hoists Robin off the ground with
one arm. Cannonballs the other fist into Robin's
stomach. Robin folds.

The woodsmen find this hysterical. They disappear into
the tree. Will administers one final kick before
leaving. Robin staggers to his feet. Glares furiously
at Aslan.
<b>                       ROBIN

</b><b>EXT. FOREST CLEARING - DAY
</b>A large tree trunk spans a swift-flowing river. The
ragged band of woodsmen approach the makeshift bridge.
Stop in their tracks. Robin stands on the bridge,
brandishing a long wooden staff.
<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         This is my bridge. No one crosses
         without paying tax.

John grabs a hefty, gnarled staff.   Strides to the
bridge.
<b>                       JOHN LITTLE
</b>         Alright, m'old cock. You wanna
         nuther good wallopin'?
His confidence melting, Robin glances back at Duncan
and Aslan, who grins like a fan at a boxing match. John
storms at Robin. Staffs thrash. Driven back, Robin
connects a blow on John's foot.
The giant is off-balance. Robin follows up. Lands a
couple to the ribs. John responds with heavy swings,
which Robin blocks deftly. Back and forth, blow for
blow, all blocked. John chuckles with every swing.
Enjoying the time of his life.
Their staffs lock. It's strength against strength.
Robin is no match. With one mighty thrust, John
hurtles him into the stream. The woodsmen cheer loudly.
Aslan watches impassively.
Robin scrambles back onto the bridge.   John waits,
grinning.
<b>                       JOHN LITTLE

<b>                       WILL SCARLET
</b>         Don't fool with him. Get him!

John charges. Robin fends him off, gets in some shots
of his own. John swings in a giant arc. Robin ducks.
John loses balance and falls to his knees. Robin allows
him time to right himself.
John comes at him again, pummeling. Wood splinters from
the impact. Brute force versus agility. Agility is
beginning to prevail, when Robin's staff splits in two.
<b>                       JOHN LITTLE
</b>         Swimmin' time again, ol' chum.
The coup de grace. Lands heavily. Robin teeters.
Falls. Disappears under the foaming water... does not
re-emerge. John waits. The spectators rush to the bank.
No sign.

Suddenly Robin arcs up out of the water. His hands clamp
onto John's ankles. Robin heaves with all his might.
John topples headfirst into the water. Surfaces in panic.
<b>                        JOHN LITTLE
</b>         Help!   Cain't bloody swim.
He submerges again.   Robin pulls his head above water.
<b>                         ROBIN
</b>         Do you yield?

The terrified giant sputters. Goes under again, flailing
with arms and legs. Robin holds his head just above the
surface.
<b>                         ROBIN
</b>         Do you yield?

<b>                        ROBIN
</b>         Good.   Now put your feet down.
John struggles, then his feet hit bottom... The water
only reaches his chest.
<b>                       JOHN LITTLE
</b>         I'll be buggered.
<b>                       ROBIN

A tense pause while all wait for Little's reaction.
<b>                       JOHN LITTLE
</b>         Robin Hood, ya got balls o' solid
         rock.
He hands Robin back the medallion. Chuckling loudly, he
swoops Robin up in his arms and carries him to the bank.

<b>EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - NIGHT

He spits black objects from his mouth.      Dead bees.   John
grins.
<b>                          LITTLE JOHN
</b>            Real honey.
He takes the jug back. Sneezes royally, spewing all over
the brew. Oblivious, he hands the contaminated jug to
Aslan.
<b>                          ASLAN

heartily.    Wulf cautiously approaches Robin.

green and runs. His father cracks up.

Drunken laughter.    Robin turns to the next man at the
fireside.

Duncan walks alone, with the aid of his staff. Body
stooped, clothes ragged, a pathetic figure. Ahead is
the main gate to the walled city of Nottingham.
Fresh horse manure. A man's hand reaches into it and
spreads it over his clothes. And his face -- Robin,
dressed as Duncan.

stare of the armored GUARD at the gate.

Robin runs to the courtyard and leaps on the Sheriff's
horse, which is held by a stunned groom. He rides
through the busy marketplace. A crossbowman tracks
him. A sure shot.

stumbles into the bowman. His bolt flies harmlessly

Robin is stripped to the waist, his muscled skin ravaged
with scars.

         I am ready, Will.
Will bends, as if checking the horse's legs. Secretly
grabs a handful of sand. Swings into the saddle and digs
in his heels.
Closing in, Will flings the sand in Robin's eyes. Robin
clutches his hands to his face, blinded. Will spins
back to the attack.
His sword slashes. Reacting to the sound, Robin rolls
aside. The men cheer like a big fight crowd.

Robin's POV is blurred. Ducking the blade, he grabs
Will's arm. A blow glances off his shoulder.
Robin falls to his knees, still blinded. Will rides
right at him, to trample him. Robin scrambles away.
Will wheels his horse. A flashing hoof grazes Robin's
chest.
Robin leaps to his feet and yells at the top of his
lungs. Panicked, the HORSE rears, WHINNYING wildly.
Will struggles to stay in the saddle. Loses his sword.
Robin seizes the moment and runs to a water trough.
Douses his face. Yells at Will.

Will stabs wildly, more and more frustrated. Laughter
spreads, as Robin plays hide and seek around the horse's
legs. Grabbing the end of the spear, he clowns a tug
of war.
Enraged, Will strains and tries to kick Robin away.
Suddenly, Robin lets go. Unbalanced, Will flies back-
wards off his mount.
Robin snatches the spear and raises it over his fallen
adversary. The crowd falls silent. Robin strikes. The
point quivers in the ground below Will's crotch. Will
wriggles in terror. Impaled, his pants rip open.

The crowd is convulsed with laughter. Robin catches his
breath. Does not see Will, who grabs a heavy staff and
runs at him. A strong hand grasps Will's arm as he is
about to strike.

<b>EXT. FOREST ROAD - DAY
</b>Autumn. The forest is a mosaic of green, gold, orange,
and red. A giant eye in a circle of glass. Aslan, his
telescope raised.
<b>                          ASLAN
</b>            Here they come.
<b>                          ROBIN
</b>            How many?
<b>                           ASLAN
</b>            Two wagons.   Twenty escort.
<b>                           ROBIN
</b>            Twenty?   They usually have five.
He grabs the telescope.

<b>SCOPE POV
</b>A phalanx of   mounted soldiers, a cart loaded with
barrels, and   a tax wagon. The wagon is an armored box on
wheels, with   crossbow slits in the side. Guy of Gisborne
commands the   escort.
<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b><b>                          ROBIN
</b>            This is no ordinary convoy.
Bull calls up from below, where a ragged group of woods-
men lies nervously in ambush.
<b>                          BULL
</b>            'ow many?

</b><b>                       ROBIN
</b>         Er, about ten.
                (then, to Aslan)
         Why scare them? They can't count
         anyway.
<b>                       ASLAN
</b>         And they call me the barbarian.
<b>                         ROBIN
</b>         Let's go.
Together they run down the hill, keeping low.
Gisborne eyes the forest. The beer cart is steered by a
fat red-faced FRIAR, raucously singing hymns and quaffing
from a jug, which he repeatedly dips into one of the
barrels.
ARROWS WHISTLE in. The Friar yells and drops his jug. A
soldier is hit. At the forest edge, four woodsmen reload
their longbows. Dressed in green, their faces
camouflaged.
The mounted soldiers charge them. The  woodsmen run into
the trees. As the horsemen close in,  the runners leap
into a trench. Lift up matted screens  of brush and
grass. It's as if they disappeared.   The soldiers slash
wildly at the thick screens.
More arrows fly. More soldiers fall. The others spin
in confusion, trying to discern the enemy. More woods-
men break from cover. Run down a narrow path. Gisborne
urges his men to pursue. They ride in single file,
beating their way through the tangled branches.

The runners dive into the trees, as other men haul on
ropes, raising a giant screen in the soldiers' path. The
horses swerve, on the edge of a twenty-foot drop to the
river gorge. Momentum  carries many of them over the
cliff.
<b>BACK ON ROADWAY
</b>Robin and Aslan swing down from the trees onto the tax
wagon. Kick down the two drivers and take the reins,
steering the wagon off the road. The archers inside are
unable to fire at them.
Little John leaps onto the beer cart, sending the Friar
hurtling back among the barrels. The Friar slams his
head and drops unconscious. John whips the horse,
driving the cart after Robin. Another camouflage screen
is lifted into place, covering their route.

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>Gisborne races back to the road... the wagons are gone.
He rides frantically back and forth. Searching and
cursing.
<b>EXT. FOREST CLEARING - DAY
</b>Robin climbs onto the tax wagon's roof.     Angry shouts
from inside.
<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         Surrender your weapons. I give
         you my word you shall go free.
In answer, a swordblade jabs up through the roof, near
his feet.

<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         Ah, I feared as much.
He signals to Aslan, who steers the tax wagon into the
river. Water floods in through the slits. Inside,
panic. Drowning rats.
The bowmen scramble out. What they see stops them dead.
Both banks are men in green, longbows aimed directly at
them.
<b>                                               CUT TO:
</b><b>COUNTRYSIDE
</b>Sparks. An axe pounds into the lock of a strongbox. The
lock snaps. Little John pries open the lid. Reacts in
astonishment. The trunk is filled to the brim with
glittering gold coins. The woodsmen press around.
Cheers of celebration.

<b>                       LITTLE JOHN
</b>                (awestruck)
         I'll be buggered.
<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         This treasure had a purpose.     We
         must find out what.
He turns at the sound of a brawl from the Friar's cart.
The Friar is at the bottom of a struggling heap of bodies.
<b>                        ROBIN
</b>         Get off him.   He's a man of the
         cloth.
Robin drags the men off. The Friar clambers to his feet.
Around him are strewn battered and winded woodsmen.

</b><b>                       FRIAR
</b>         The Lord's blessing on you, kind
         sir. These sinners were attempting
         to steal these libations destined
         for the monks of St. Catherine's.
He indicates his cargo of barrels.
<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         It appears to me, Reverend Friar,
         that many of the libations have
         found their way into your own
         esteemed person.
Ignoring him, the Friar mounts the cart.

<b>                       FRIAR
</b>         A thousand pardons, sir, but duty
         beckons. I must hasten on.

</b>                (grabbing the bridle)
         A moment, my reverend friend. You

         travel with Nottingham's soldiers.
<b>                         BULL
</b>         Aye, tax him.
This sparks a chorus of comments.
<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         My men are thirsty and have much
         to celebrate.
<b>                       FRIAR
</b>         Lord bless me, sir, are these your
         men? I had mistook them for
         common thieves. Kindly step
         aside.
<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         Surely the Lord has the charity to
         spare a few barrels to good
         Christian men.
The Friar relents, loosening his grip on the reins.
<b>                       FRIAR
</b>         Well, sir, if you wish them to
         share in the good Lord's brew...
Casually reaching under the seat, he pulls out a club.
Smites Robin with it.

Robin staggers. The Friar whips up the horse. Dazed,
Robin grabs for the fat man's leg. Gets a holy sandal
full in the face.
<b>                         FRIAR
</b>         Giddyup, nag!
The Friar's horse, as obese as his driver, slowly raises
his head from the grass and ambles forward. Robin runs
after them and dives at the Friar, toppling him from the
cart.

<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         You leave when I say.
Scrambling to his feet, the Friar glances skyward.
<b>                       FRIAR
</b>         Protect me, Lord.
He sweeps his foot, knocking Robin's legs out from under
him. Hurls his full body weight on top of him. Whooomf!
<b>                         FRIAR
</b>         Yield!
He bounces on Robin's stomach. Robin can barely breathe.
The woodsmen are enjoying the spectacle.
<b>                       FRIAR
</b>         Confess that Friar Tuck is a
         better, holier, and braver man

<b>                         FRIAR
</b>         Yield, I say!    Yield to Friar
         Tuck.
Desperate, Robin bites the Friar's leg. Tuck howls.
Robin extricates himself, grabs for a weapon. Smashes
the Friar's head with his drinking jug.
<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         Yield yourself!
He dives onto the Friar and hammers his head into the
ground.

         humility.
<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         Well, Friar Tuck. We have need
         of an honest man of God, to
         minister to these men and their
         families. What do you say?

The Friar struggles to his feet. He reviews the motley
faces of his potential flock. His eyes light on the
grinning Saracen.
<b>                       FRIAR
</b>         I'd rather roast in hell.
He punches Robin in the gut.

profusely, grunting with strain. His horse contentedly
follows.
<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         Giddyup, Friar.

He flicks the reins, steering the cart into camp. Women
and children rush to greet their men. Jeer the roped
soldier-prisoners. The Friar checks out his flock. A
woman curtsies, another crosses herself, children touch
his robe in wonder.
<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         What do you say now, Tuck?    Here

Tuck surveys the hopeful, hungry faces. The little
hamlet of half-built huts. He folds his hands in a
moment of prayer.
<b>                       FRIAR
</b>         The Lord moves in mysterious

With a hair-raising war cry, Aslan   leaps INTO VIEW.
Stripped to the waist, brandishing   his scimitar. The
Captain tries to back away. Robin    tries to restrain
Aslan, is hurled aside. Snarling,    drooling at the mouth,
Aslan explores the Captain's body   with his hands. A
butcher checking meat.
<b>                       ROBIN

         Fatter, yes... more meat.
The other soldier, who definitely  has more flesh on the
bone, is struck dumb with horror,  as Aslan turns his
attention to him. With one swing   of his sword, Aslan
slices through the man's ropes.   Drags him to his feet.
Little John runs over.

Blood-curdling SCREAMS from behind the wagon where Aslan

wildly at the Captain.

He places a hand reassuringly on his cousin's shoulder.

</b>         Cousin, we must be strong. We

Without warning, he drives the blade into Gisborne's
belly.

         It is indeed fine steel.

<b>EXT. VILLAGE - DAY
</b>A small procession. Tuck drives his cart, Bull the tax
wagon. Both vehicles laden with supplies. Wulf and Hal
pass out flour, chickens, blankets, clothing to the
villagers. Their weapons are prominently displayed.
Tuck swigs from a jar, passes it to an old villager.

jug in greeting.

<b>EXT. FOREST POOL - DAY
</b>Water, sparkling with sunlight. Bursts, as Robin dives
in naked. He luxuriates in the cool water... HOOFBEATS.
He attempts to hide... too late. Four horses emerge from
the trees. Bull and Hal, with Marian and her servant
Sarah sandwiched between them. Bull has a black eye.
Marian jumps down.

</b>         You send men to drag me from my

She casts a contemptuous look over his muscled body,
glistening with water.

</b>         How dare you expose yourself to

She slugs him. Robin stumbles backwards into the water.
Bull grins, gesturing to Sarah and pointing to his own
black eye.
<b>                       BULL
</b>         The big 'un did the same to me.


<b>EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - DAY
</b>An arrow flies into a bull's-eye, crudely marked on a
tree. Little John lowers his crossbow, delighted at
his shot.

</b>                (to Wulf)
         Right m'lad. Let's see how close
         you can git to that bugger.
Wulf takes aim. His arrow slices clear through his
father's arrow, splitting it in two. Little John slaps
Wulf on the back and beckons everyone over.
<b>                       LITTLE JOHN
</b>         Take a gander at this 'un, mates.
         Never seen nuthin' like it in
         my bloomin' life.

Robin leads Marian through the camp... the beginnings of
a village -- women doing laundry, kids playing, men prac-
ticing archery and swordplay, others working on defenses,
camouflaging a giant pit. Marian is impressed, but not
about to admit it.
<b>                       MARIAN
</b>         This better be damned important.
Robin leads her into a hut. Inside is a trove of cap-
tured loot -- purses, jewelry, weaponry, fancy coats
and... the treasure chest. At Robin's nod, Bull throws
back the lid. Marian is speechless.
<b>                       ROBIN

Is there a hint of concern for him also?

A little girl approaches, holding a bouquet of wild
flowers. Touched, Marian kneels to accept the offering.

Hooves fly along a track. Sarah and the courier.    The
courier reins in, Sarah draws alongside.

Sarah leans down to look and the courier cudgels her
across the neck. She falls from the saddle, unconscious.

<b>INT. DUBOIS MANSION - MARIAN'S CHAMBER - NIGHT
</b>Flickering candlelight. Marian is alone, reading. A
sudden gust extinguishes her candle. HAMMERING and
SHOUTING from a distant part of the house. Unnerved,
she calls out.

<b>                          MARIAN
</b>         Who is there?     Duncan!

<b>INT. DUBOIS MANSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b>Marian enters stealthily. A candle in one hand, a
drawn dagger in the other. Something leaps at her!...
A cat, looking for scraps on the kitchen table. She
shoos him down.
<b>                       MARIAN
</b>         Off, Nicodemus. Go find mice.
She sighs with relief... is grabbed from behind.   A

He reveals a large scar on his wrist -- removes his

her with his sword.
<b>                       SOLDIER
</b>         Drop your blade.

She drops the sword. He hurls her against the table.
Lays his blade against her chest.

<b>                       SOLDIER
</b>         You owe me favors, wench. Bare
         your breasts... or I will do it

Resignedly, she raises a hand to loosen the string on her
dress. With the other hand she reaches behind her, grabs
a pepper bowl. Flips the contents into his face.
Screaming, he grabs his  face. She reaches for her
dagger. He slashes with   his sword. She backs to the
fireplace, grabs a spit  of roasted chickens... drives
the point clean through  his chest.
He stares in shock at his own blood pouring from the
cooked fowls pinned to his breast... FOOTSTEPS... masked
soldiers converge from both sides of the house, dragging
the servants. Duncan  is shoved through the door.

These are the men who revealed their faces to Lord
Locksley in the Druid ceremony. Nottingham toys with
a white rat on his arm.

</b>         It is impossible to attack him

Sounds of COMMOTION outside. The door swings open.
Framed in the doorway is a colossus in black armor.
His helmet is the head of a dragon. He slowly raises the
visor. Deep tribal scars on his cheeks. Implacable
ferocity in his eyes.
<b>                       CELTIC CHIEFTAIN

</b>The Chieftain strides across to the fire. Grabs a
burning log. The Baron backs away in fear. The log
spits sparks as the Chieftain raises it above his head...
and drives it into his own palm. He stares unblinking
at the Baron, holding the log to his hand for a full
three seconds.
An awed silence. Nottingham grins, delighted with the
demonstration. He deposits his white rat onto the model.
<b>                       NOTTINGHAM
</b>         This rat Hood has hidden out in
         the forest.  He resists all our
         assaults with traps and devices,
         while he robs us blind. We must
         bring him out and destroy him.
The rat has scurried into the shelter of the model trees.
The Chieftain watches impassively, then calmly touches
the log to the model. The trees ignite... the RAT
SQUEALS in terror and runs. The Chieftain cuts off its
escape, setting fire to more trees... again... and
again. The Sheriff watches the flames, fascinated.

watch in amusement. Tuck scoops another  jug and hands it
to Aslan.

Checks the ground. Horse tracks. He dismounts, moves

</b>No one visible. Debris. Smoke rises from ashes.
Remnants of a recent ceremony.

circle. There is blood on the sacrificial altar.

Robin. Before he can react, a cudgel stuns him into
blackness.

<b>INT. CAVE - DAY
</b>Robin's eyes  -- he wakes. Squints around him, the dark
smoke-filled  recesses of the caves. The walls weave.
Eerie WATERY  sounds, like the CRIES of drowning men.
He tries to  stand.
<b>                       VOICE (O.S.)

A figure in a flowing white robe. Angelic. Floating

Reaches out his hand.
<b>                       MARIAN
</b>         Death is not to be feared,

Her LAUGH ECHOES around the cave, as if hundreds of lost

ing his ears. Marian lifts his face to hers.
<b>                        MARIAN

changes in his vision. Her eyes glow red. Her face
starts to shrivel -- He is kissing the wrinkled lips of
Mortianna.
He pulls away... strong arms grab him. He shakes his
head, trying to make sense. Through his BLURRED vision,

A guard forces Robin's hand across the page... then
cries out, clutching his back... An arrow lodged be-
tween his shoulders.
In the cave mouth are Wulf, bow in hand, Bull kneeling
beside Sarah's corpse, and Aslan.

Aslan's war CRY RICHOCHETS off the cave walls. A    curved
scimitar in one hand, a straight English sword in   the
other, his arms are lethal windmills. The masked    guards
are cut down left and right. Mortianna retreats,    scurry-
ing into the depths of the cave.

</b>Bull joins the fray, charging like his namesake, howling
in rage, flailing at heads with his quarterstaff. Wulf
stays in the mouth, picking off men with deadly accuracy.
A furious melee. Bull and Aslan mow down the enemy like
hay, battling far superior odds. Soon they are the only
two left standing. Bull peers cautiously into the dark-
ness. Behind him, one of his victims crawls back to his
feet... and lunges.
<b>                          ASLAN
</b>         Behind you!
Too late. A sword is driven through Bull's gut. Aslan
grabs the attacker by the neck and pile-drives him into
the cave wall. The man's SKULL CRACKS against the rocks.
Aslan runs to Robin's side, as Wulf hurries to Bull's.
Robin is slumped against a rock.

crouched beside Bull, who murmurs his dying words.
<b>                       BULL
</b>         Ya be sure Sarah gits a Christian
         burial. Promise me, boy.

</b>         I promise.
Aslan stumbles at the edge of a deep crevasse. Far be-
low he sees Mortianna, clambering down the steep rock.
For a second their eyes meet. She hisses -- venom,
hatred, fear -- then is gone.

<b>EXT. GREGOR CAVES - DAY
</b>Aslan carries Robin outside. Robin is staggering,
glassy-eyed, mumbling incoherently. His arm blocks
the light from his eyes.

He drops to one knee, slams Robin violently across the
other. Slaps him on the back and forces his fingers
down his throat.

vainly attempts to instill calm.

</b>          Ya'll be jus' fine. Lil' smoke

Scared and injured woodsmen careen out of the trees.
Full retreat.

          It's burning for miles, John.
          It's hotter than hades, and them
          damn screens ain't worth nothing.
Two woodsmen, blinded and choking, stumble into one of
their own camouflaged pits. Hideous screams as they're
impaled on hidden stakes. John tries to gather the able-
bodied men to his side.
<b>                        LITTLE JOHN
</b>          'Ere, lads... Over 'ere! We must

Most of them keep on running.

<b>EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY
</b>Celts, arrayed behind their Chieftain. An awesome sight.
Clad in hides and skins, painted arms and faces, head-
pieces the faces of wild animals. Standing in eerie
silence. A loud CLAP of THUNDER. Nottingham rides up
to the Chieftain.
<b>                       NOTTINGHAM
</b>         I want prisoners.
The Chieftain does not turn his head.

</b>         Nevertheless, I need prisoners.
With only a short flick of his head, the Chieftain spits.
Nottingham waves his arm, signalling his own foot sol-
diers to advance. The Chieftain raises his sword.
Instantly a tumultuous chilling roar from his warriors.
They charge forward.

<b>EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - DAY
</b>The bloodcurdling cry fills the sky. Amidst the smoke
and chaos, Little John's small band is gathered at the
edge of the clearing.

<b>EXT. FOREST ROAD - DAY
</b>Aslan reins in. In the valley below, the forest is
ablaze. The Sheriff's armed hordes swarm over the em-
battled woodsmen.
<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         Wulf, stay here. I need your

He climbs onto Wulf's horse, steers it right at the heart
of the enemy... Aslan blocks his way, grabbing his reins.

</b>Robin debates.   Relents.   They urge their horses into
a gallop.

<b>EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - DAY
</b>The Sheriff's men stomp through the burning forest.
From the other side of the flaming trees, Little John's
men pick off shots with their longbows. They retreat,
turn and fire again.
They back into a clearing... The Celtic mercenaries
charge at them across the open ground. The woodsmen
drop their bows. Hand-to-hand combat. Woodsmen are
being decimated.

Little John storms and shouts, cutting down the enemy,
inspiring his men. The Scotsmen are awed by this giant.
Tuck is confronted by a wild-eyed Celt.
<b>                       FRIAR
</b>         Surely you would not harm a man
         of the cloth?
The man swings, Tuck sidesteps.
<b>                        FRIAR
</b>         You would?   Then to hellfire with
         you.
He pummels the man to the ground with his staff.
The woodsmen are broken into two groups. One group,
including Will, is surrounded and surrenders. The others
fight on.

Bleeding from several wounds, Little John is surrounded
by four Celts. He spins, challenging them, spitting out
expletives. Defiant to the last... suddenly his
attackers are hurled aside. Robin rides right through
them, slashing with his sword.
<b>                       LITTLE JOHN
</b>         'Bout bleedin' time, mush.
Tuck is driven to the ground... his assailant is deliver-
ing the lethal blow, when Aslan cuts him down. Tuck
glances heavenwards.
<b>                       FRIAR
</b>         Thank you, Lord.

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>Aslan is a   wild man. Steering his horse with just legs
and knees,   he strikes out with both swords to left and
right. The    momentum is turning. Wulf appears at the
edge of the   clearing. Starts picking off stragglers.
His father   spots him.
<b>                       LITTLE JOHN
</b>         Git the bleedin' 'ell outa there,
         ya li'l bugger.
Distracted, he doesn't see a Celt swing at his back...
but Wulf's arrow pierces the man's adam's apple. He
freezes in mid-air, before toppling at John's feet.
When John turns back, Wulf is being dragged away by
three of the Sherrif's men. He attempts to pursue, but
is intercepted by two more Celts... and struck down.
Aslan charges between the two Celts. Slashes down
with both swords. Both men topple to the ground
simultaneously.
Suddenly all is quiet.    The smoking clearing is a mass
of fallen bodies. Only    four men seem to be alive.
Robin, Aslan, Tuck, who   is slouched against a tree
gasping for breath, and   Hal, who kneels clutching his
wounded shoulder.
Robin dismounts and runs to Little John. Overwhelmed
and exhausted, he slumps over the giant's unmoving form.
<b>                       LITTLE JOHN
</b>         Don't 'ee start bleedin'
         blubberin', or ya'll make me
         bloody vomit.

Robin manages a relieved smile. Aslan strides over.
All around them lie slain Celts and woodsmen.
<b>                       ASLAN
</b>         It was a fiendish mind that
         planned this campaign.

<b>EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - DUSK
</b>A shovel breaks dirt. Beyond exhaustion, Robin digs a
grave. The clearing is transformed into a cemetery.
Tuck blesses the bodies of Bull and Sarah. Aslan drags
a Celt's corpse into a grave. Throws the man's armor
and weapons into a growing pile.

He stares across the desolate clearing.

<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         There is too much blood on my
         hands.

<b>INT. CASTLE DUNGEONS - NIGHT
</b>A heavy key turns in a lock. Bolts drawn back. Fol-
lowed by guards, Nottingham enters the torture chamber
where the captured woodsmen are chained, among them
Wulf and Will Scarlet. Putrid ankle-deep water on the
floor, walls encrusted with dried blood and grime.
Nottingham walks up to the FIRST MAN. Wry smile.

<b>EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - NIGHT
</b>A winter's night. Bitterly    cold.  Sad figures huddled
around a small fire. Fanny    tends to John's wounds, their
little ones asleep by their   feet.  John drinks and passes
the jug to Tuck, who numbly   shakes his head. Too
depressed even to drink.
Aslan folds his prayer rug and walks over to Robin, who
sits alone, staring vacantly into the darkness.
<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         My pride brought us to this.

Aslan stares at him, then turns away. Not the time for
argument. Robin fingers his father's medallion... rips
it from his neck.

branch.

<b>NOVEMBER MOON

dangling in its center... the last thing Robin sees

moon against the black sky...

<b>ITS NEGATIVE IMAGE
</b>-- a black circle against a white sky. An executioner.
The round medallion has become a noose.
In the noose appears Wulf's face. The executioner hauls
on the rope and Wulf's features contort in the agony of
death. Another noose, another face... Duncan. Another
-- Bull. Another -- Marian.
<b>                       MARIAN
</b>         Kiss me, Robin.
The noose tightens on her neck. As she dies, her face
shrivels into the cackling features of Mortianna.

Next, Robin's father.   He stares accusingly right AT us.
<b>                       LOCKSLEY
</b>         Why have you betrayed me?   Why?
Before he pulls the rope, the executioner peels back his
hood... It is Robin. Gloating, he hauls on the rope.
His laughter blends with that of Mortianna in a hideous
cacophony.

</b>The first streaks of light fight their way through a
thick, morning mist. Out of the mist steps a figure,
at first indecipherable. Aware of his presence,
Robin looks up.

shoulders.

</b>         Search 'im, Hal. 'E'll 'ave a
         bloody blade on 'im somewheres.
Will eyes the accusing faces. Hal searches, lifts Will's
shirt. His whole skin is lacerated with deep gashes and
fresh burns.
<b>                         LITTLE JOHN

He steps back.    Ready to listen.

Fanny drops her head on John's shoulder.
<b>                         WILL SCARLET

in the floor. Wulf lifts his eyes to a chink of light
high in the wall. The purple sky is turning black. He
fingers his wooden crucifix.

prayer.

Aslan is crushing charcoal into a mixture of yellow
powder, which is turning black. Tuck approaches.

           to you the mysteries of the black

Tuck takes a bowl of the powder close to the fire to
examine it. Aslan snatches it back... Before Tuck can
react, Robin walks up.

Robin reaches out and shakes Aslan's hand. A moment of
bonding. He moves on to the others, clasping each man's
hand as he speaks.

Sheriff decked in wedding finery. He enters...

... Mortianna's apothecary. Dark, smoke-filled. Foul
things in jars. Animals in cages, waiting to meet
unspeakable ends. Marian is strapped in a chair, flanked
by two armed guards.

open. Mortianna pours the blood-red liquid down her
throat. Marian fights, gagging and choking... until the
drug takes its effect. She slumps forward. Nottingham
watches with amusement.

Clasps the dice-like runes.

heart.
<b>                       MORTIANNA

too cowed to show support. Fanny glances at her son,
crosses herself and scurries into the castle, unnoticed.
On horseback, encircled by guards, the Sheriff and his
baron cronies watch the outlaws progress with cruel
amusement. A  yell attracts Nottingham. Will is being

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>Across the square, Will points urgently in Tuck's
direction.

<b>EXT. CITY WALL - DAY
</b>A massive oak stands near the southern wall. A large
figure climbs to its uppermost branches. Little John.
He scrambles from the tree, starts to climb the wall
itself. He slips frequently.

<b>EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY
</b>The prisoners are led to the scaffold, where the hooded
executioner waits, along with the Chieftain. Wulf
staggers, from his beating.
Nottingham's men encircle Tuck's cart.    He watches them
nervously.

<b>EXT. CITY PARAPET - DAY
</b>Fanny lowers a knotted rope over the battlement. Far
below, John clings to the outer wall. Above him it's
sheer, without footholds. The rope doesn't reach his
fingertips. He stretches, loses balance. Falls...
desperately grabbing at the rope. He swings, clinging
by one arm, his body smashing into the wall.

<b>EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY
</b>Will leads the Sheriff to Tuck's cart.

<b>                       NOTTINGHAM

<b>                       FRIAR

</b>         This man claims you have outlaws
         concealed in these barrels. Among

Tuck glares at Will with unconcealed hatred.
<b>                       FRIAR

A cask is shattered... wine torrents out.
<b>                       WILL SCARLET
</b>         Try another. There are many
         barrels, only a few outlaws.
A drum roll. The Sheriff's attention turns to the
scaffold, where the first victim is escorted up the
steps -- Wulf.
Tense, Tuck pulls a tinder box from his robes, strikes
a flame.

<b>EXT. CITY PARAPET - DAY
</b>John strains, heaving his giant frame up the rope. He
nears the top, just as a SENTRY approaches. Fanny blocks
the man's view.
<b>                       SENTRY
</b>         What is your business, woman?
<b>                       FANNY

         Likes a good 'angin', I do. Luvly
         view up 'ere, ain't it?
She gestures below. The Sentry looks, then turns back to
her... notices the rope. With all her might, Fanny rams
his head into the stone battlement. Twice. Three times.
He slumps unconscious.

<b>EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY
</b>Wulf crosses himself as the executioner steers him to the
noose. A hush falls... except for a rotund old woman who
is barging to the front. And a WOUNDED SOLDIER, his head
bandaged, who eases her path, striking out with his tree-
branch crutch.
<b>                       WOUNDED SOLDIER
</b>         Give room for a fightin' man and

</b>John struggles over the battlement.   Collapses.
<b>                       FANNY
</b>         'Bout time, ya gurt lug.
She wrenches the longbow from his back, fumbles for an
arrow.
<b>                       FANNY
</b>         We be too late.

<b>EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY
</b>The scaffold is impregnable. Celts and their Chieftain
guard the platform itself. The Sherriff's men surround
the base.
The executioner encircles Wulf's neck with the noose.
SPARKS! Tuck ignites a fuse-cord leading to one of the
barrels.
A hand tightens the noose... Another grasps an arrow.
The executioner's eyes glint through the slits.
Nottingham intently watches Wulf.
The Chieftain stands, impassive.
Fingers close on a bowstring... the fuse-cord burns.
Wulf steps to the trap, ready to plunge.   His eyes close.
An arrow flies... slices through the executioner's eye
slit.
The executioner falls. Little John celebrates... but
the Chieftain leaps forward... releases the trap.
Wulf's body plunges.   The rope snaps tight.
Little John yells.   Fanny screams.
A figure leaps onto the platform... the wounded soldier
throws aside his crutch... Robin!
Wulf dangles, strangling.   His hands wrench at the
choking cord.

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>The burning fuse-cord reaches the barrel. Tuck hurls the
smoking barrel thundering towards the Sheriff... Spotting
it, Nottingham urges his horse over his own men in his
effort to escape.
The Chieftain smites at Robin... his blow is blocked...
by the Celt with the boar's head.
KAABOOM! The GUNPOWDER in the barrel EXPLODES. Spewing
smoke and wood. SCREAMS of panic. Soldiers fly. Mass
confusion.
Amidst the smoke... Robin's sword slashes through Wulf's
rope. He hauls him onto the platform.

Another figure on the platform... the old woman. Slashes
the ropes of the other prisoners. Whips off her wig...
It's Hal. He passes out weapons from a bundle under his
arm.
<b>                       HAL
</b>         Here... By God... Let's fight 'em!
<b>                      WOODSMAN

<b>                       HAL

A guard attacks, Hal fells him.
<b>                       HAL
</b>         Take that, ya mug.
No stutter this time!    The woodsmen join battle with the
guards.
The Chieftain cudgels his Celt attacker across the head.
The boar's head helmet tumbles... revealing Aslan.
<b>                        CHIEFTAIN
</b>         Impostor!   You dishonor the clan.
Aslan retreats, fending off the Chieftain's shattering
blows.

<b>FROM PARAPET
</b>John and Fanny peer down as the smoke clears. They watch
Wulf struggle to his feet. A Celt sneaks up behind him.

shaft.
<b>                         LITTLE JOHN
</b>           ...Or don't fight at all.

<b>ON SCENE
</b>Robin leaps and swings from gallows to gallows, kicking
out, slashing down. Sends two Celts hurtling down the
trap hole.
Will battles the Sheriff. A reprise of his own fight
with Robin, the roles reversed. The Sheriff, armed and
mounted, flails at Will, who, unarmed, dodges in and
around the horse's legs.
Aslan and the Chieftain are locked in mortal combat.
Aslan stumbles back and falls. The Chieftain swipes at
his head. Aslan rolls aside. The sword smashes wood.
Tuck surrounded, rolls another smoking BARREL... It
<b>EXPLODES.
</b>The Greybeard Baron spots Little John and Fanny on the
parapet.
<b>                          GREYBEARD BARON
</b>           Up there!   No mercy, shoot them!
Crossbowmen on the opposite parapet fire.      Bolts ricochet
all around Little John and Fanny.

<b>ON SCAFFOLD
</b>
Wulf guards the steps, beating back all comers.

<b>ON SCENE
</b>Aslan evades the charging Chieftain. Drop-kicks a
soldier, takes his sword, and whirls back at the
Chieftain. His blows have no effect on the Scot's black
armor.
The Sheriff rears his horse... hooves flail.. knocking
Will to his knees. The Sheriff lunges... Desperate, Will
grasps the sword, ignoring the pain... a tug of war.
Blood pours from Will's hands, where the blade cuts in.
He suddenly lets go... Nottingham topples from his
horse. Will leaps on him.

four men.
<b>                       NOTTINGHAM
</b>         Here's another message to Robin
         Hood, written in your blood.
He drives his sword repeatedly, insanely, into Will's
belly.
<b>                       WILL SCARLET
</b>         It's over, fool. You can kill my
         body, but you cannot kill our
         spirit.
He finally drops... Nottingham heads for the castle.
Robin attempts to follow. He swings from the noose,
using the rope to vault over the surrounding soldiers.
As he lands, he is waylaid by one of the barons and his
men.
<b>                        REDHEAD BARON
</b>         It's Hood!   Get him!
The Chieftain knocks Aslan down.   Aslan loses his sword.
<b>                        CHIEFTAIN
</b>         I am iron.   I am rock. I am your
         death.
Aslan spots one of John's arrows protruding from a dead
Celt's back. Scrambles over and tears it out.
<b>                       ASLAN
</b>         You talk too much!
He leaps... rams the arrow through the Chieftain's
mouthpiece... out the back of his neck. The Chieftain
grabs his helmet, trying to rip it off. He topples,
his life's blood gushing from both sides of his neck.
Aslan plants a foot on the slain warrior.
<b>                       ASLAN
</b>         Englishmen! I am not one of you,
         yet I fight for you. Against a

The onlookers are inspired. Grabbing weapons from fallen
soldiers, many join the fray.

</b>Nottingham runs through the castle gate.   Angry peasants

A guard winds down the giant gate.   Nottingham hurls him
aside.
<b>                       NOTTINGHAM
</b>         Too slow, fool!
He hacks at the ropes. The gate slices down like a
guillotine, pinning soldiers and peasants alike.

Fighting his way towards the gate, Robin sees   with dismay
that the portcullis is closed. Weakening, he    staves off
the redhead baron's vicious assault. Suddenly    peasants
are swarming over his attacker. The baron is    dragged off
and trampled down.
<b>                        ROBIN
</b>         Friends!   We must raise the gate.

sides.

He can't shoot fast enough. As they descend on him, he
leaps from the battlements onto a soldier's back. Grabs
his sword.
<b>                       LITTLE JOHN
</b>         Excuse me, m 'old cock. Ya mind

<b>INT. CASTLE CHAMBER - DAY
</b>Surrounded by flickering candles, Marian sits before a
mirror. In a white wedding gown. Her eyes faraway,
lifeless, in deep trance. Mortianna sensuously combs
the bride's hair with her taloned fingers. The
Sheriff's face appears in the reflection.
<b>                        NOTTINGHAM
</b>         Come!   It is time for the union.
The guards roughly haul Marian to her feet.    She is
oblivious.

<b>INT. CASTLE CHAPEL - DAY
</b>Once, Christian, now blasphemously transformed   to the
practice of black magic. The crucifix on the    altar is
upside down. Marian stands before it, between    the
Sheriff and Mortianna. The Bishop is dragged    in.
Frightened. The BATTLE SOUNDS ECHO.

Tuck jumps. Robin steers the wagon at the gate. At the

horse's back... The BARRELS EXPLODE! The portcullis is
blown to kingdom come.
Out of the smoke, Robin rides the old nag like a charger.
Leads his cheering, ragged fighters through the open gate.


<b>INT. CASTLE KITCHENS - DAY
</b>Fanny is chased into the kitchens by a vengeful soldier.
He grabs her and pushes her into the open cooking fire.
Desperate, she grabs a poker and smashes him over the
head. The servants stare in shock... A chef comes at
Fanny with a knife.

<b>EXT. CASTLE FORECOURT - DAY
</b>Hal and the others battle against huge odds. More
peasants join them, daring to take on the Sheriff's hated

as a shield, using the man's own sword against his
companions. In seconds, all three are down and Robin is
off and running.
Down corridors, searching. Soldiers and armed servants
converge to block his way. Robin strikes, vaults, flings
statues. Up the stairs... topples a suit of armor down
on his pursuers.

soldiers. He smashes one by swinging the heavy door into
him, hurtles a pew at another. He springs off another
pew, taking down a third.

He sees a familiar pair of holy sandals marching towards
him. Tuck leading a barefoot army. Dozens of ragged
prisoners, armed with chains and torture implements.
<b>                       FRIAR
</b>         Sinners, beware! God's avengers
         are at hand.
Dying, Hal manages a weak smile.
<b>                       HAL
</b>         Go' bless ya, Tuck.

Tuck flails a chain at a Celt.
<b>                       FRIAR
</b>         Repent, heathen!
The man spins to strike back... freezes... grinning...
Aslan!

<b>INT. CASTLE - KITCHENS - DAY
</b>The chef raises his knife.    Fanny appeals to the whole
room.
<b>                       FANNY
</b>         Listen! Outside, your countrymen
         rise against the Sheriff.

</b><b>                       FANNY (CONT'D)
</b>         Is there one man or woman here
         who does not hate him? Who has
         not suffered at his hand?
                (to the chef)
         Turn that on the Sheriff and his
         bullies.
A deadly pause. A woman cook dumps the giant wedding
cake right over the chef. Suddenly it's havoc. Flying
food and cutlery.

<b>EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY
</b>
A full-scale riot. The populace has turned. Into the
fray comes Fanny Little, leading a rabble of servants
and kitchen staff, fighting with pots, pans, brooms,
knives, hooks, and bedpans.

<b>INT. CASTLE - CHAPEL - DAY
</b>Nottingham slashes maniacally.   Robin is cornered,
weakening.
<b>                       NOTTINGHAM
</b>         You should have stayed away,
         Locksley. Fools like you never
         learn.
A blow slices Robin's arm. His sword flies from his
grasp. Nottingham gloats. Two of his men scramble back
to their feet. Robin is beat... a war cry! Aslan,
followed by Tuck.

<b>                         ASLAN
</b>         Ali akbar!
<b>                         FRIAR
</b>         Amen!
<b>                       MORTIANNA
</b>                (seeing Aslan)
         Agh... the painted one!
Nottingham glances over... a split-second opportunity!...
Robin lashes out. Kicks the Sheriff in the gut, chops
down his sword hand. His father's sword clatters to the
floor.
Whirling swords in each hand, Aslan attacks the other
men. Robin pile-drives Nottingham into the wall.
<b>                                            (CONTINUED)

</b><b>                                                        127.
</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>The Bishop makes his escape.    Tuck blocks his path.
<b>                      FRIAR
</b>         So! You sold your soul to the
         devil?
<b>                       BISHOP
</b>         No, I swear it, in God's name.
<b>                       FRIAR
</b>         Blasphemer! You accuse innocent
         men of Druid worship while you
         practice the black arts yourself.
The Bishop surreptitiously draws a dagger from his robes.

A taloned hand grips a spear... Mortianna creeps up on
Aslan.
<b>                       ROBIN
</b>                (glimpsing her)
         Watch out!
Aslan spins... too late. Screeching, Mortianna drives
the spear into Aslan's side. He cries out and slides to
the floor.
Nottingham uses Robin's distraction to regain his sword.
Back on the defensive, Robin tries to evade the blows.
Mortianna drags Marian out onto a balcony. Robin cannot
pursue. In acute pain, Aslan struggles to his feet.
Grasping the spear where it enters his side, he pulls with
all his strength.
The Bishop, concealed dagger in hand, approaches Tuck.

<b>                       BISHOP
</b>                (innocently)
         I am sure you would not strike a
         man of the cloth.
<b>                        FRIAR
</b>         Think again!
Without an eyeblink's pause, Tuck punches the Bishop so
hard, he flies back THROUGH a stained-glass WINDOW.

<b>EXT. CASTLE - BALCONY - DAY
</b>Mortianna hauls Marian against the battlements. Peers
down at the battle. She spins in shock at Aslan's voice.
<b>                                            (CONTINUED)

</b><b>                                                     128.
</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b><b>                          ASLAN
</b>            What you fear is not below.
He charges at her with the bloody spear. She screams
hideously as he thrusts it right through her chest.
Her madness is superhuman. With strength beyond all
reason, she crawls up the spear's shaft, forcing it
further through her body in her effort to get at him.
Clutching, screeching, hissing.
Her talons groping at his face, Aslan strains to the
last ounce of his will and heaves her over the battle-
ments. With an ear-splitting shriek, she plummets to
the ground.


<b>INT. CASTLE CHAPEL - DAY
</b>Sword raised, Nottingham has Robin backed against the
altar.
<b>                          NOTTINGHAM
</b>            What can your puny God do for
            you now?
The blade comes whirring down... clang! It's blocked.
Robin has the altar's crucifix in his hand.
He swings it again, slamming Nottingham across the
temple.  The Sheriff hits the floor. Robin grabs his
father's sword. Raises it two-fisted. Nottingham tries
to squirm away.
<b>                          ROBIN
</b>            This is for my father.

He drives the sword down, like a stake, right through
Nottingham's heart. The man shudders, and is still.
Robin stands over him. Drained. Tuck rushes outside.
Kneels at Aslan's side. Robin spots Marian swaying on
the edge of the steep parapet.

<b>EXT. CASTLE BALCONY - DAY
</b>Robin grabs Marian, pulling her back. Carefully lifts
her face. Her lifeless eyes suddenly flash. She lashes
out. A spitfire.
<b>                           MARIAN
</b>            Let me go!   Who are you?

</b><b>                       ROBIN
</b>                (restraining her)
         I'm your sworn protector.   Any
         way I see fit.

<b>EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY
</b>Robin emerges from the castle. Draped over his shoulder,
Marian is kicking and beating at him. He reaches the
fountain in the center of the square and tosses her into
the freezing water.
She leaps to her feet, yelling. Slips and tumbles back.
Water streams from her bridal gown. A crowd gathers,
enjoying the show.
<b>                        MARIAN
</b>         Robin?   Oh God, is that you?
She stumbles out of the fountain... and storms at him,
pounding her fists on his chest.
<b>                       MARIAN
</b>         How dare you?!
Robin grins at the crowd.
<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         I think she's feeling better.
Marian looks about her... the chaotic aftermath of
battle. Reality gradually sinks in. She folds against
Robin's chest.
Little John arrives, his huge arms enfolding Wulf and
Fanny.
<b>                       LITTLE JOHN
</b>         We done it, mate. We clobbered
         the buggers.
<b>                         FANNY
</b>         Are you 'urt?
<b>                         ROBIN
</b>         It will mend.
He spots a group kneeling beside the fallen body of
Aslan. His smile fades. He runs over. Cradles Aslan's
head.
<b>                       ROBIN
</b>         Aslan, my friend.

</b><b>                       ASLAN

         Robin.
<b>                       FRIAR
</b>                (shaking Aslan)
         You die on me, you son of satan,
         and I swear I'll bury you as a
         Christian in St. Catherine's
         Cathedral with a thousand monks
         chanting prayers for your
         miserable soul. You hear me?
<b>                       ASLAN
</b>                (weakly)
         I have no strength, Brother Tuck.
<b>                       FRIAR
</b>                (kicking him)
         A fine friend you are! By the
         grace of Allah and Jehovah we
         have won the day, and you want to
         give up the ghost. I'll pickle
         your remains in mead, lay you
         in your grave with a pig for a
         companion, and mark it with a
         cross as big as this castle.
<b>                        ASLAN
</b>         Please!   It hurts when I laugh.
<b>                      FRIAR

<b>                       ROBIN
</b>                (laughs)
         Here, Tuck. Look after him.    You
         deserve each other.
Robin stands, Marian joins him. Around them cheering
grows, till the whole crowd is in unison.
<b>                        CROWD

</b><b>                       FRIAR (O.S.)
</b>         By the power vested in me by

         pronounce you husband and wife.
Tuck is performing the ceremony before the happy couple.
<b>                       FRIAR
</b>         You may kiss the bride.
The husband draws back the bride's veil.    Robin and
Marian. They kiss... long.
<b>                      FRIAR
</b>               (whispers)
         Hurry. We waste good celebration
         time.
They break   the embrace, turn to the congregation and
start down   the aisle. They pause at the front pew,
where KING   RICHARD and members of his court are sitting.
Robin bows,   Marian curtsies.
<b>                       KING RICHARD
</b>         May I kiss the bride?
<b>                       ROBIN

<b>                       KING RICHARD
</b>                (kissing Marian's
                 cheek)
         You look radiant, cousin.
<b>                       ROBIN

</b>         It is I who am honored, Lord
         Locksley. Thanks to you I still
         have a throne.
They continue down the aisle, past the smiling congre-
gation. Waiting by the door is Aslan. He and Robin
embrace.
<b>                       ASLAN

Robin laughs.
