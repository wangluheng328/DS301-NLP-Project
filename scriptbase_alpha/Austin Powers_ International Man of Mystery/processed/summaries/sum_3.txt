In 1967, after burning most of his henchmen, Dr.
Evil sets a trap for Austin Powers, but freezes himself so Austin won't catch him.
Austin then volunteers to be frozen in case Dr.
Evil shows up again.
30 years later, Dr.
Evil wakes up in Nevada and steals a nuclear weapon and holds the world hostage for 1 million dollars.
Sorry, 100 billion dollars.
Austin is woken up to stop Dr.
Evil but gets Vanessa Kensington, his ex-partner's daughter and goes to Vegas to look for Evil, but finds out there is no longer any free love in the 90's, or Swinging.
