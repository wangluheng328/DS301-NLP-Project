In 1899, New York City got its news from an army of ragged orphans and runaways, called newsies.
They sold the newspapers of Joseph Pulitzer, William Randolph Hearst, and other great publishers.
Like many of his friends, newsie Jack Kelly (Christian Bale) dreams of a better life far from the hardship of the streets.
But when Pulitzer and Hearst raise distribution prices at the newsies' expense, Jack finds a cause to fight for, and must decide between his dreams and his newfound responsibility.
