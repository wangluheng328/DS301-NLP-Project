Ash finds himself stranded in the year 1300 AD with his car, his shotgun, and his chainsaw.
Soon he is discovered and thought to be a spy for a rival kingdom and is taken prisoner.
After proving his merit in The Pit, he decides to help the kingdom retrieve the Necronomicon (which will also help him return to his own time), which they need to battle the supernatural forces at play in the land.
Ash accidentally releases the Army of Darkness when retrieving the book, and a fight to the finish ensues.
