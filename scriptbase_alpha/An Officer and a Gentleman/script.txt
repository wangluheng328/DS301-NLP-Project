                                       FINAL DRAFT

                                      April 13, 1981

                

               FADE IN:

               EXT. MANILA AIRPORT - FULL SHOT - DAY

               A Philippine Airlines passenger plane is arriving and touching 
               down.

               ANGLE - THE PLANE

               A 13-year old boy starts down the ramp, a suitcase in one 
               hand, an old photo-strip in the other. He studies the strip 
               closely as he searches the faces of the people greeting the 
               passengers.

               CLOSE - THE PHOTO STRIP

               A handsome sailor is necking with his girl in each of the 
               three shots.

               CLOSE - THE BOY

               looking around.

               HIS EYES FALL ON A SAILOR

               It's the same sailor from the photo strip, only about fifteen 
               years older. If he was in his early twenties then, now he's 
               in his mid-thirties. He's in the uniform of a 1st class Petty 
               Officer. He searches the faces of the descending passengers, 
               very uncertain and uncomfortable.

               THE BOY AND THE SAILOR

               come together very, very tentatively. The sailor, BYRON MAYO, 
               extends a hand to young ZACK.

                                     BYRON
                         You, Zack?

                                     ZACK
                         Yes, Sir.

                                     BYRON
                         I'm Byron. Nice to meet you.
                              (awkwardly)
                         C'mon. Let's go get your luggage.

               They head off together.

               EXT. THE AIRPORT PARKING LOT - DAY

               Byron and Zack step aboard one of the colorful jeepneys that 
               Manila is famous for. We MOVE WITH the jeepney as it leaves 
               the airport and starts down the highway toward Olongapo.

               The boy is frightened but he's also excited by the strange, 
               super-chrome and ornately-decorated vehicle he's riding in.

               They're not alone in the small bus. Ten or more Filipinos 
               ride with them, some in suits and ties, others in the rougher 
               attire of farmers. One old woman carries a big cage on her 
               lap with a squawking fluttering chicken in it.

                                     BYRON
                         Take that coat off. This is the 
                         Philippines.

               He helps Zack out of his coat.

                                     BYRON
                              (making conversation)
                         How was the flight? They take care 
                         of you okay? Long way from Norfolk, 
                         isn't it?

                                     ZACK
                         Yes, sir.

                                     BYRON
                         Listen, kid, I was sorry to hear 
                         about your mom. That's pretty rough. 
                         I would've returned your call a lot 
                         sooner but I was out at sea...

                                     ZACK
                         I been calling for four months.

                                     BYRON
                         Well, that's how long I've been out 
                         at sea.

               EXT. THE ROAD TO OLONGAPO - DAY

               The jeepney has only two passengers now, Byron and Zack. A 
               roadside sign reads: "U.S. NAVAL FACILITY, SUBIC BAY ... 12 
               miles."

               EXT. THE HONKY-TONK SAILOR TOWN OF OLONGAPO - DAY

               Known throughout the Seventh Fleet as the armpit of the 
               Orient, Olongapo is one, long rain-rutted street of gaudy 
               bars and rattan-walled whorehouses.

               Countless jeepneys careen past with their silly fringe awnings 
               and chrome accoutrements, many filled with U.S. sailor boys 
               and officers on liberty.

               Zack and Byron's jeepney ENTERS SHOT and stops in front of 
               the noisiest and raunchiest bar on the strip.

                                     BYRON
                         This is it. This is where I live.

               MOVING WITH ZACK AND BYRON

               CAMERA FAVORS the boy as they head for the entrance of the 
               bar, Zack taking in the kinky street activity: "Beenie boys," 
               small boned Filipino boys dressed up as exquisite young girls, 
               hustling tricks on the sidewalk while their sisters lounge 
               in the doorway of places like "California Dreamin'" and "The 
               Manhattan Club," in nipple-showing tank-tops, licking their 
               lips.

               INT. THE RAUCOUS BAR - DAY

               CAMERA CONTINUES MOVING with Zack and Byron as they cross 
               through the NOISY bar toward a stairwell at the back. Navy 
               enlisted men are making out openly with bar girls and Zack 
               even sees one little girl stick her hand right down the front 
               40 of a sailor boy's pants.

               Byron glances at the boy, a little embarrassed by his digs.

               Zack is staring at every girl he passes, nervous but a little 
               excited by it all, too.

                                     BYRON
                         If I were in port more, I'd rent a 
                         better place, but this works out 
                         okay.

               They start up the stairs.

               INT. BYRON'S ROOM - DAY

               They walk in and find two semi-naked prostitutes lying on 
               the bed. Zack's eyes are as big as silver dollars.

                                     BYRON
                         I thought you girls were gonna do 
                         some shopping.
                              (gives them money)
                         Tiki, Maria... I want you to meet my 
                         son.

               The girls giggle as they hurry into their clothes and leave.

               Byron closes the door.

                                     BYRON
                         This is it. This is where I live. I 
                         suppose you could bunk over there 
                         and you could go to school at the 
                         base.

                                     ZACK
                         Great.

                                     BYRON
                         I'm not finished. I'll only be in 
                         port one week a month and when I'm 
                         here you'd never catch me playing 
                         daddy with you 'cause it's not who I 
                         am. Like I told you on the phone, 
                         you I'd be better off in that state 
                         school back in Virginia.

                                     ZACK
                         I ain't never going back to that 
                         school, sir.

                                     BYRON
                         You got to kid. Let me spell it out 
                         for you. This is a whorehouse. And I 
                         happen to like my life the way it is 
                         and nobody's gonna make me change.

                                     ZACK
                         I don't care about that. I just ain't 
                         going back. You don't want me? Okay. 
                         I'll find me another place.

               He opens the door and walks out.

               MOVING WITH ZACK DOWN THE STAIRWELL

               Byron appears on the landing above.

                                     BYRON
                         Hey, come back.

               Zack keeps moving.

                                     BYRON
                         Come back here, kid!

                                     ZACK
                              (turns)
                         What for?

                                     BYRON
                              (grudgingly)
                         Okay, okay. You win.

                                     ZACK
                              (brightens)
                         Thank you, sir!

                                     BYRON
                         Stop calling me 'sir! I ain't no 
                         officer. My name is Byron.

               On the boy's happy expression we:

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. THE BAR - SEVERAL WEEKS LATER

               Zack sits on the stairs watching a crazy scene taking place 
               on the long bar. A bunch of jet pilots off one of the carriers 
               are in town and they're playing a game of "chicken". Each 
               pilot must take a turn being pushed down the bar in a chair 
               on rollers. The winner is the guy who flies the farthest 
               without bailing out of his chair. The whores are rooting 
               them on and gambling money is being waved in the air. As 
               Tiki, one of Byron's girls, climbs the stairs, he catches 
               her hand and gestures questioningly in the direction of the 
               hotshot fliers.

                                     TIKI
                         Hot shot jet jockeys. Maybe you grow 
                         up like that, fly mach five, no jive.

               The boy laughs. Then Byron comes out of his room, his sea 
               bag over his shoulder. He passes the kids some folding money.

                                     BYRON
                         Here, kid. Put this in your shoe in 
                         case you need it.

               Zack hides the money.

               QUICK SHOT - TWO FILIPINO BOYS ABOUT ZACK'S AGE

               They see him hide the money in his shoe.

               ANGLE - BYRON AND ZACK

               Byron kisses his two mama-sans goodbye, shakes Zack's hand 
               and strides out of the bar.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. THE STREETS OF OLONGAPO - DAY

               Zack is walking along the main drag, looking in the curio 
               stores, when the two Filipino boys approach him, smiling 
               innocently.

                                     1ST FILIPINO BOY
                         Hey, palequero. You new in the P.I.?

                                     ZACK
                         Yeah. I've been here a couple of 
                         weeks.

                                     2ND FILIPINO BOY
                         Wanna see some nice things, guy? We 
                         could show you around. Nobody knows 
                         this shithole like us.

               The two boys laugh and Zack laughs, too, trusting them.

                                     ZACK
                         Sure. I guess it's okay.

               They start off together but as they reach a narrow alleyway, 
               the two boys shove Zack into it.

                                     ZACK
                         Hey!

                                     1ST FILIPINO BOY
                         Hey, big spender. Give us some money.

                                     ZACK
                         I don't have any money.

                                     1ST FILIPINO BOY
                              (furious)
                         Bullshit! Get it out!!

               The first Filipino kicks Zack in the balls.

               VARIOUS SHOTS OF THE FIGHT

               Zack isn't a bad fighter but he's no match for either of the 
               Filipinos, especially the leader, who has a way of fighting 
               that is something to watch. He uses his feet. Waving the 
               other Filipino aside, he destroys the American with spinning 
               roundhouse kicks to his stomach and his face. Zack goes down 
               from a kick to the groin. Another kick to the head and he 
               loses consciousness. His two attackers bend over him to rifle 
               his pockets.

               Finding the five dollar bill he's hidden in his shoe, they 
               run off down a dark alley, one of them nearly tripping over 
               a dead dog.

               TIGHTEN ON ZACK

               He stirs. His eyes open. He sits up, wincing from busted 
               ribs. Reality sits heavy on his youthful features.

                                                   DISSOLVE VERY SLOWLY TO:

               EXT. THE NAVY HONKY-TONK AREA OF SEATTLE - DAY

               A rough-looking young man rides his Triumph 750 Bonneville 
               through a Navy honky-tonk area in Seattle, Washington: NOISY 
               bars, a Seven Seas Locker Club, a credit jeweler, a pawn 
               shop.

               The boy who took his licks in the Filipino back alley is now 
               a man in his mid-twenties. A long mane of jet-black hair. A 
               scuzzy beard. The same cold blue eyes. He wears jeans and 
               big, muddy boots. There's a tattoo of an eagle half-revealed 
               under the sleeve of his T-shirt.

               EXT. A FLEA-BAG HOTEL - DAY

               Zack Mayo drives up and climbs an outside stairway to a second-
               story entrance.

               INSIDE THE FLEA-BAG HOTEL - DAY

               CAMERA MOVES WITH Zack down a dark corridor, past a succession 
               of rooms. A door is open, affording him a quick glimpse of a 
               woman and child, a sailor's uniform hanging on a chair nearby.

               The sailor appears and closes the door in Zack's face. Zack 
               consults an old postcard he takes from his pocket and pauses 
               in front of a doorway. He knocks authoritatively and shouts:

                                     ZACK
                         Shore Patrol! Shore Patrol! Open 
                         up!!

               A moment later the door opens and Byron stands there, fumbling 
               to cover his nudity with a little kimono. A naked prostitute 
               in her late teens watches from a rumpled bed.

                                     ZACK
                         Hi, Byron.

                                     BYRON
                         Zack, you little shit! You haven't 
                         changed a bit!

                                     ZACK
                         Neither have you, pard!

               They come together in a macho embrace like old whoring 
               buddies.

                                     BYRON
                              (to his girl)
                         Hey, honey, look at this! My son! 
                         Isn't he beautiful?
                              (to Zack)
                         You should've called!

                                     ZACK
                         You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? 
                         I graduated. I got my degree.

                                     BYRON
                         I thought you quit school. Last I 
                         heard you were on your way to a 
                         construction job or something down 
                         in Brazil.

                                     ZACK
                         Yeah, I made some money down there, 
                         then I talked my way into another 
                         college and I did it. I wasn't magna 
                         cum laude but I did okay. You 
                         should've seen me in my cap and gown.

                                     BYRON
                         Why the fuck didn't you invite me? I 
                         would've come.

               Zack's expression sheds some doubt on that subject but Byron 
               chooses to ignore it. He turns to the prostitute.

                                     BYRON
                         Get on the phone, honey. Call up 
                         your friend... Gloria... Gloria big 
                         tits. We're gonna celebrate! You 
                         hear that? My son's graduated from 
                         college!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BYRON'S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

               It's an orgy, all right. Father and son style. Zack and his 
               girl on the left half of the bed, Byron and his girl on the 
               right. Pumping away. Drinking and passing a wine bottle 
               around.

               Candles burning in dishes flickering against the seedy walls 
               where the only decorations are monkeywood carvings Byron 
               brought back from the Philippines.

                                     1ST PROSTITUTE
                         Are you guys really father and son? 
                         You're putting us on, right?

                                     BYRON
                         Right. We're putting you on. What 
                         happened to that joint?

                                     2ND PROSTITUTE
                         I think it went out.

                                     BYRON
                              (pigeon English)
                         Ay, palequero.

                                     ZACK
                         Ay, palequero. Never hochi in the 
                         P.I.

                                     BYRON
                              (laughs)
                         Wha-chu-say, palequero? Short time, 
                         long time, only ten dolla.

               Both men laugh and the girls start laughing, too.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. BYRON'S APARTMENT - THE NEXT MORNING

               Zack awakens and finds himself entangled in arms and legs 
               and soiled sheets. He carefully slips free and rises to his 
               feet on unsteady legs, his head pounding, his eyes blood-
               red.

               As he's pulling on his shorts, his eyes suddenly take in the 
               apartment and the lifestyle it represents: half-smoked joints 
               and cigarettes cascading out of makeshift ashtrays; empty 
               wine bottles; and three naked people, snoring, their bodies 
               draped over one another.

               A look of profound disgust comes over Zack's face and he 
               turns away from the scene and heads into the bathroom.

               INT. BYRON'S BATHROOM

               Zack finds some aspirins and downs them with a glass of water.

               Suddenly, Byron comes in, shoves him out of the way, and 
               pukes in the toilet. Zack stares at him in an intense way, 
               seeing more than the moment, seeing all the other times he's 
               played out this scene with this man.

                                     BYRON
                         What're you looking at? Hand me that 
                         towel.

               Zack hands him the towel. Byron swigs some mouthwash, then 
               turns to his son.

                                     BYRON
                         Hey, that was pretty great wasn't 
                         it? Not as great as that night with 
                         the three stewardesses in Manila... 
                         but pretty fucking nice.

               Zack says nothing but there's something on his mind.

                                     BYRON
                         So what're you doing in Seattle?

                                     ZACK
                         Get ready pard. This one's gonna 
                         blow you away.

                                     BYRON
                         Zackie, nothing you do will ever 
                         surprise me, pard, not after some of 
                         the shit you've pulled.

                                     ZACK
                         I joined the Navy.

               Byron's face drops and Zack laughs.

                                     BYRON
                         You... in the Navy?

                                     ZACK
                         That's right. I'm on my way over to 
                         this officer school in Port Ranier.

                                     BYRON
                         Why?

                                     ZACK
                         To fly jets. To be the fastest 
                         motherfucker in the world. You gotta 
                         come and visit me. I'm only a couple 
                         hours away.

                                     BYRON
                         Who gave you this idea?

                                     ZACK
                         Nobody. It just came to me.

               Byron starts to laugh and Zack reddens slightly.

                                     BYRON
                         I don't believe this! You... in the 
                         Navy... an officer... that's like me 
                         saying I'm running for fucking 
                         president. Hey, man, look at you! 
                         Hey, officers don't have tattoos!

               He laughs until he practically chokes.

                                     ZACK
                         Look, I Ill be seeing you, Pard. 
                         Take care.

               Zack leaves the bathroom and starts putting his clothes on.

                                     BYRON
                         Don't be pissed. I'm on your side, 
                         Pard. I just don't want you to do 
                         something you'll regret. You gotta 
                         give six years to the Navy if you 
                         wanna fly... that's six years with 
                         the most uptight assholes God put on 
                         this earth. Officers aren't like you 
                         and me, man. It's another breed.

                                     ZACK
                         You afraid you'll have to salute me, 
                         Chief?

                                     BYRON
                         Fuck, no! Why would I care about 
                         something as dumb as that?

                                     ZACK
                         I don't know. That's just how it 
                         sounded. Well, I'll see you.

               He opens the door and walks out. Byron moves to the door.

                                     BYRON
                         Hey, what did you want? A lot of 
                         fatherly bullshit? A big pat on the 
                         back?

                                     ZACK
                              (turns, grins)
                         From you, pard? Never. Thanks for 
                         the graduation present.

                                     BYRON
                         Hey, Zackie -- don't go away mad.

               EXT. AN AREA NEAR THE GATES OF PORT RANIER NAVAL AIR STATION - 
               DAY

               Starting CLOSE on Zack's upper arm as he covers his eagle 
               tattoo with a band-aid. WIDEN as he drives through the gates 
               of the sprawling air station.

               EXT. THE GATES OF THE AIR STATION - DAY

               He drives through the gates and past the guard gate and 
               disappears into a stand of tall trees.

               A sign by the road reads: "THROUGH THESE GATES PASS THE FUTURE

               OF NAVAL AVIATION."

               EXT. AN AIRFIELD (2ND UNIT)

               He motors past a line of aircraft.

               EXT. AN INTERSECTION

               He stops to let a class of candidates run past in their 
               fatigues. CAMERA PANS as he crosses the intersection, 
               revealing a large parade ground where two classes of Aviation 
               Officer Candidates are drilling with rifles.

               EXT. THE BASE ADMIN. BUILDING

               Zack parks his motorcycle near the F-14 "Tomcat" jet fighter 
               plane that sits in front of the Admin. Building like a piece 
               of sculpture, and is directed by a Navy lieutenant to wait 
               with the other civilian types under a tree.

               NEW ANGLE - THE ADMIN. BUILDING

               A girl named CASEY SEEGER steps out of a rented car, kisses 
               her parents goodbye and, carrying a small suitcase, approaches 
               the same officer. She has the slim, athletic body of a runner 
               and a naturally pretty face without even the slightest hint 
               of makeup, and she finds most of the thirty boys under the 
               tree ogling her as she approaches.

               FAVORING ZACK

               He flirts with Casey as she joins them under the tree, and 
               she flirts back, taking a place near the five other girls.

               Nearby, two other boys are eyeing Casey. The brain-looking 
               kid is TOPPER DANIELS. The tall Okie is SID WORLEY.

                                     TOPPER
                         Why would a girl who looks like that 
                         go into the military?

                                     SID
                         Hey, this is the modern Navy.

               STAFF SERGEANT EMIL FOLEY, USMC

               strides smartly toward them and comes to a brisk, heel-
               clapping halt in front of them, a cane tucked under his arm 
               like a swagger stick and the traditional "Smokey the Bear" 
               hat of the drill instructor on his head.

                                     FOLEY
                         Fall in! Form a line, you slimey 
                         worms! Heels on that chalk line! 
                         Attin-hut!

               The thirty-six civilians shuffle into a single line, ill-
               concealed looks passing between them as though to say, "Get 
               a load of this character."

                                     FOLEY
                         Now when I say "understand" I want 
                         the whole group to say, "Yes, sir!" 
                         Understand?

                                     GROUP
                              (raggedly)
                         Yes, sir!

                                     FOLEY
                         Louder!

                                     GROUP
                         Yes, sir!!

                                     FOLEY
                         I don't believe what I'm seeing! 
                         Where've you been all your lives, at 
                         an orgy? Listening to Mick Jagger 
                         and bad mouthing your country, I'll 
                         bet.

               He strolls menacingly down the ranks, probing them, plumbing 
               them with his squinty little eyes. He pauses in front of 
               Perryman.

                                     FOLEY
                         Stop eyeballing me, boy! You are not 
                         worthy enough to look your superiors 
                         in the eye. Use your peripheral 
                         vision! Understand?!

                                     GROUP
                         Yes, sir!

               His voice shifts register, becoming almost human.

                                     FOLEY
                              (a sudden grin)
                         I know why most of you are here. 
                         We're not stupid. But before you get 
                         to sell what we teach you over at 
                         United Airlines, you gotta give the 
                         Navy six years of your life, Sweet 
                         Pea. Lot of things can happen in six 
                         year. Another war could come up in 
                         six years. If you're too peaceful a 
                         person to dump napalm on an enemy 
                         village where there might be women 
                         and children, I'm gonna find that 
                         out. Understand?

                                     GROUP
                         Yes, sir!

               He pauses in front of Sid, and smiles the friendliest of 
               smiles.

                                     FOLEY
                         Hi, son.

                                     SID
                         How're you doing, Sarge?

               Foley's eyes become instantly crazed.

                                     FOLEY
                         What did you call me?

                                     SID
                              (taken aback)
                         Pardon?

                                     FOLEY
                         What did you call me, boy?

                                     SID
                         I called you Sarge.

                                     FOLEY
                         Before that.

                                     SID
                         I didn't call you anything before 
                         that.

                                     FOLEY
                         You said, 'How're you?' I am not a 
                         'ewe,' boy! A ewe is a female sheep, 
                         boy! Is that what you think I am, 
                         boy?

                                     SID
                         No.

                                     FOLEY
                         No, sir!

                                     SID
                         No, sir.

                                     FOLEY
                         Lauder, Sweet Pea!

                                     SID
                         No, sir!

                                     FOLEY
                         Do you want to fuck me up the ass, 
                         boy? Is that why you called me a 
                         'ewe'? Are you a queer?

                                     SID
                         No, sir.

                                     FOLEY
                         Where are you from, boy?

                                     SID
                         Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

                                     FOLEY
                         Only two things come out of Oklahoma, 
                         steers and queers. Which one are 
                         you, boy? I don't see any horns so 
                         you must be a queer.

                                     SID
                         No, sir.

                                     FOLEY
                         Stop whispering, Sweet Pea, you're 
                         giving me a hard on!

               Zack starts to chuckle and Foley eyeballs him hard.

                                     FOLEY
                         Are you laughing at me, dick-brain?

                                     ZACK
                         No, sir!

               Foley pushes his face close to Zack's and tries to stare him 
               down. Zack just stares back, totally unintimidated.

                                     FOLEY
                         You'd better stop eyeballing me, 
                         boy, or I'll rip your eyes out and 
                         skull-fuck you to death!

               Zack keeps a straight face.

                                     FOLEY
                         What's your name, boy?

                                     ZACK
                         Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!

                                     FOLEY
                         How did you slip into this program, 
                         Mayo? I didn't know the Navy was so 
                         hard up.
                              (noticing the band-
                              aid)
                         You got an injury there, Mayo?

                                     ZACK
                         Not exactly, sir.

               Foley suddenly tears the Band-Air off his arm, revealing the 
               eagle tattoo. Foley leans close to inspect it.

                                     FOLEY
                         Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is 
                         really wonder work.

                                     ZACK
                         Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.

                                     FOLEY
                         I thought I recognized the work.
                              (stares him in the 
                              eye)
                         Be proud of those wings. They're the 
                         only ones you're gonna leave here 
                         with, Mayo-naise.

               He moves on to one of the others, short, barrel-shaped DELLA- 
               SERRA.

               Foley glances at the roster, then at Della-Serra.

                                     FOLEY
                         Hmmmm... Emiliano Santos Della-Serra. 
                         You a college boy, Della-Serra?

                                     DELLA-SERRA
                              (proudly)
                         Yes, sir! I graduated with honors 
                         from Texas Tech, sir! Math major, 
                         sir!

                                     FOLEY
                         You don't say. See this cane, Della-
                         Serra? See these little notches near 
                         the handle? There's a notch for every 
                         college puke like you, Della-Serra, 
                         who I got to D.O.R. -- drop on request -- 
                         from this program. And the first one 
                         I want to carve out of this class is 
                         you, Emiliano.

               Giving him an evil look, Foley turns away.

                                     FOLEY
                         I expect to lose half of you before 
                         I'm finished.

                                     FOLEY
                         I will use every means at my disposal, 
                         fair or unfair, to trip you up, expose 
                         your weaknesses... as a potential 
                         aviator... and as a human being. The 
                         price at the other end is a flight 
                         education worth one million dollars, 
                         but first you have to get past me.
                              (shouts)
                         Lay your suitcases open for 
                         inspection!

               Zack and the others open their packs and suitcases on the 
               sidewalk. With his cane, Foley suddenly spears a pair of 
               lacy underwear in Casey Seeger's suitcase and dangles it 
               high in the air.

                                     FOLEY
                         Seeger, are we going to have to watch 
                         you run around in these for the next 
                         thirteen weeks?

               She reaches for them but he teases her and dangles them out 
               of reach.

                                     FOLEY
                         Some girls will do almost anything 
                         to get laid. Are you one of those 
                         girls, Seeger? Did you put in for 
                         AOCS to get gang-banged, Seeger?

               Casey reddens and stares daggers at the man.

                                     CASEY
                         Sir, you can yell at me if that's 
                         what you're supposed to do, sir. But 
                         you have no right to insult me, sir.

               Foley pushes his nose right up to hers and screams:

                                     FOLEY
                         I'll call you a beaver sandwich, if 
                         I want to, until the day they 
                         commission you an officer and a 
                         gentleman and I have to call you 
                         'sir'!

                                     FOLEY
                              (beat)
                         My language offend you, Seeger? Well, 
                         maybe the Navy's not for you 'cause 
                         you'll hear far worse out in the 
                         fleet?
                              (in the same breath)
                         You've got five seconds to put your 
                         suitcases in order and prepare to 
                         move out. Time's up. Attin-shut! 
                         Left-humph! Fo-wud-harch!

               The candidates fall all over themselves trying to follow his 
               orders.

                                                           CUT ABRUPTLY TO:

               EXT. A LARGE PAPER MILL - THAT SAME DAY

               Minutes before quitting time.

               INT. THE MILL - DAY

               PAULA POKRIFKI and LYNETTE POMEROY, two twenty one year olds, 
               are both looking at their watches as they wait for that magic 
               moment. Two older women are assisting them in the job of 
               stacking and tying brown paper bags, then returning the tied 
               stacks to the conveyor.

                                     LYNETTE
                         Come on, guys. It's five o'clock.

                                     PAULA
                         One more minute.

               The conveyor finally shuts down and the four women join the 
               flow of workers heading for the exit.

               EXT. THE MILL PARKING LOT - DAY

               As Paula and Lynette are leaving, Paula calls out to a woman 
               just then getting into a beat-up old Toyota. In her youth 
               easily as pretty as her daughter, ESTER POKRIFKI is now a 
               tired, over-worked woman of 39, looking closer to 45.

                                     PAULA
                         'Bye, Mom, see you later.
                              (beat)
                         C'mon, Lynette, before she asks when 
                         I'll be home.

               The girls hurry toward Lynette's old Falcon, Ester watching 
               with a mingling of emotions, from nostalgia to concern.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE BASE BARBER SHOP - DAY

               STARTING CLOSE ON shears as they cut a swath through a forest 
               of hair. In a matter of seconds, Della-Serra is converted 
               from a long-haired individualist into a cipher, balder than 
               a baby's butt. He leaves and one of the female candidates 
               sits down in the chair. Whack! Whack! The barber doesn't 
               shave her but he cuts her long hair very short.

               EXT. THE BASE BARBER SHOP - DAY

               Foley collars Della-Serra and turns to the line of candidates 
               waiting to get inside.

                                     FOLEY
                         Now this is my idea of an ass bandit. 
                         Wait 'til some of our local girls 
                         get a look at you, scrotum head.

               The class cracks up laughing, especially big Sid, standing 
               near the end of the line with Zack and Casey.

                                     FOLEY
                         You think that's funny, Worley? Let 
                         me tell you something. Not all the 
                         obstacles that can trip you up are 
                         on this base.

                              line)
                         As long as there's been Navy base 
                         here there's been what you might as 
                         well call your Puget Sound Debs, 
                         poor girls who come across the sound 
                         on the ferry every weekend for only 
                         one reason, to marry themselves a 
                         Naval aviator.

               Skeptical looks from the candidates.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LYNETTE'S FALCON - DAY

               As they clear the gates of the National Paper Company Paula 
               reaches into the back seat for her makeup kit, positions it 
               on her lap, and adjusts the mirror. Off comes the scarf.

               Out come the pin curls, one by one and she starts combing 
               out her hair. Their disco dresses, satiny and suggestive 
               even in their plastic cleaner's bags, are hanging from 
               separate hooks in the back.

                                     FOLEY (V.O.)
                         Now a Puget Deb will tell you, 'Honey, 
                         don't y'all worry 'bout no 
                         contraceptives. I got that all taken 
                         care of.' Well, don't you believe a 
                         word of it, Sweet Pea...

               EXT. THE ROAD TO THE FERRY - DAY

               Paula is fleetingly naked as she pulls her emerald green 
               dress over her head.

                                     FOLEY
                         ...'cause a Puget Deb will do anything 
                         and say anything to trap you... and 
                         once she has you by the balls, child, 
                         you might just find yourself with a 
                         couple of income tax deductions you 
                         didn't have when you came here.

               EXT. FERRY - STARTING ON THE FALCON - DAY

               It appears to be moving, because the scenery is moving by.

               Lynette and Paula have traded places and now Lynette sits in 
               the passenger seat, pulling the pin curls out of her hair.

               She finishes and quickly takes off her shirt and bra.

                                     FOLEY
                         I know this all sounds silly to you, 
                         especially in this so-called modern 
                         age...

               A guy in a car traveling alongside the Falcon is getting an 
               eyeful. Lynette sees him and gives him a dirty look.

                                     FOLEY
                         ...but you scuzzy college pukes had 
                         better watch out, 'cause they're out 
                         there. And you, Sweet Pea, are the 
                         answer to their dreams.

               We PULL BACK to reveal that the two cars are not on the 
               highway, but aboard an open ferry crossing the Puget Sound.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE UNIFORM SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

               CAMERA MOVES AHEAD of Zack, Sid and Casey. Navy enlisted men 
               behind the counter are handing out "Poopie Suits," "Chrome 
               Domes" and "Boonies" to the candidates as Foley looks on. 
               All the boys are bald. The girls have suffered a military 
               haircut as well, but have been mercifully allowed to keep a 
               few inches of coverage.

                                     FOLEY
                         How do you like my Poopie Factory, 
                         Seeger? You enter these doors and 
                         individual with a look that's all 
                         yours, a style, a way about you, a 
                         personality... and you come out a 
                         Poopie! That's sort of like what 
                         happens to food. It goes in looking 
                         all fancy and pretty.

               Seeger grimaces.

                                     SID
                         I knew those commercials were full 
                         of shit.

               CAMERA HOLDS on a recruiting poster on the wall.

               INT. THE INDOC BARRACKS - DAY

               The new Poopies come running in, carrying their suitcases 
               and uniform issue, Foley herding them like cattle up the 
               stairs.

                                     FOLEY
                         This is where you live, children! 
                         This is Poopie-ville! Girl Poopies 
                         to the left, boy Poopies to the right!

               INT. THE UPSTAIRS OF THE BARRACKS - QUICK SHOTS - DAY

               The Poopies find their assigned room, the five girls in a 
               wing to the left of the stairwell, the thirty-one boys in 
               the wing to the right.

               INT. ZACK'S ROOM - DAY

               The names on the door are: "PERRYMAN, MAYO, WORLEY and 
               DANIELS." Zack is the first one through the door and he grabs 
               the upper bunk by the window. His roommates come in and share 
               a look as they see what he's done. LOUIS PERRYMAN is a no-
               nonsense black, a few years older than the other, like Zack.

                                     PERRYMAN
                         How do you figure that's your bunk?

                                     ZACK
                         He said it's up to us and I got here 
                         first, didn't I?

                                     SID
                         Whatever you say, Mayonnaise.

                                     FOLEY (O.S.)
                         Fall out on the lawn in five minutes, 
                         in your Poopie suits!

               Perryman and Topper select lower bunks and start stowing 
               their gear in their lockers. Sid takes the other top bunk.

               ANGLE - THE LOCKERS

               Perryman immediately tapes a photo of his family on the door 
               of his locker, wife and two young children, one a baby in 
               diapers.

                                     TOPPER
                         You're a married man, huh, Perryman?

               Perryman touches the photo affectionately.

                                     PERRYMAN
                         Yeah. They're the main reason I'm 
                         here.

                                     TOPPER
                              (shakes his head)
                         I still can't believe I did this. A 
                         three-point-eight average from 
                         Amhearst and I signed up for this?

               Perryman laughs. Both Zack and Sid are stowing their lockers 
               expertly. Zack glances questioningly at the big Okie.

                                     SID
                              (in reply to his look)
                         I'm a service brat, pal. Same as 
                         you.

               Zack takes five new packs of cards from his suitcase and 
               hides them in his locker under his skivvies. Sid notices him 
               do it.

                                     SID
                         Someday you'll have to tell me about 
                         Subic.

               Zack says nothing. Both boys start changing into their sloppy- 
               fitting Poopie suits. 

                                     SID
                         That Foley looks like he's been 
                         through a war or two.

                                     ZACK
                         I've seen better.

                                     FOLEY
                         Fall out! Fall out!!

               Zack, Sid and their roommates push out in their Poopie suits.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE BARRACKS BUILDING - DAY

               The candidates line up outside, in their Poopie uniforms. 
               Sid lines up between Zack and Casey. For the moment, Foley 
               is nowhere to be seen, but a Navy lieutenant is talking to a 
               Navy captain in SHOT b.g.

                                     SID
                         Think there's any truth to what he 
                         was saying about those girls? Is 
                         that still going on?

                                     ZACK
                         Sure it is, Sweet Pea, but he 
                         should've warned you 'scuzzy' female 
                         types about the 'Puget Dudes.' They'll 
                         tell you they're wearing a rubber 
                         but they've bit a little hole in the 
                         end.

                                     CASEY
                         You're pretty funny, Mayo.

                                     ZACK
                         Maybe we'll be roommates, Seeger, 
                         and you'll find out how funny I really 
                         am...

               Foley suddenly appears.

                                     FOLEY
                         Seeger, Mayo and Worley -- hit the 
                         deck and give me fifty push-ups. On 
                         the double!

               The trio drops to the ground and starts doing push-ups.

               ACROSS THE STREET - DAY

               Lynette's Falcon drives up and the two girls start across 
               the street, carrying boxes of LP's.

               ON SID, ZACK AND CASEY

               They're about ten, eleven push-ups along when Casey starts 
               to fade. Foley's polished shoes ENTER SHOT and she looks up 
               at him sheepishly.

                                     FOLEY
                         Looks like you need a little work on 
                         your upper body strength, Seeger.

               He leads her off to where the other candidates stand at 
               attention, leaving Zack and Sid alone, doing push-ups. They 
               eye Lynette and Paula as they walk past.

               EXT. THE STEPS OF A NEARBY BUILDING - DAY

               NELLIE RUFFERWALL, 50, the base social director, is chatting 
               with a young Naval officer as the two girls approach in their 
               sexy disco dresses. The officer flirts with both girls as he 
               walks off.

                                     NELLIE
                         Paula, honey, Lynette... I hope you 
                         didn't call all this way just to 
                         bring me these nice records.

                                     LYNETTE
                              (eyeing the retreating 
                              officer)
                         No, ma'am. We planned on stopping at 
                         the 'O' Club tonight, one way or the 
                         other.

               ANGLE - SID AND ZACK

               About 30 push-ups in. Both are in terrific shape and have no 
               problem at all with the push-ups. They watch Paula and Lynette 
               talking with the matronly social director across the street.

                                     SID
                              (whispers)
                         Look at that hot little blonde!

               Zack is staring at Paula.

               ANGLE - PAULA AND LYNETTE

               They leave Nellie with the boxes of records and start down 
               the steps.

                                     NELLIE
                         'Bye girls, and thank you again. 
                         Blue Angels be in next month. You 
                         want me to line you up with one, 
                         just let me know.

               The girls start back across the street, in the direction of 
               the Officers' Club.

                                     LYNETTE
                         Far fucking out! I've been wanting 
                         to meet one of the Blue Angels since 
                         I can remember.

                                     PAULA
                         Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody 
                         might overhear.

                                     LYNETTE
                         Paula, look at the new Poopies.

                                     PAULA
                         Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.

                                     LYNETTE
                              (calling to them)
                         See you in a month when you get 
                         liberty!

                                     PAULA
                              (calls)
                         Don't worry. It grows out about an 
                         inch by them.

               Laughing, they start into the Officers' Club.

               NEW ANGLE - THE OFFICERS' CLUB ENTRANCE

               A handsome young pilot named DONNY TARLTON, 29, is walking 
               out just as the girls are entering.

                                     LYNETTE
                              (flirty)
                         Hi, Donny.

                                     DONNY
                         Oh, hi, Lynette. Hey, Paula, haven't 
                         seen you for a while. When're we 
                         gonna go out?

                                     PAULA
                         I already told you. I don't go out 
                         with guys who've been dating a good 
                         friend. See ya.

               The girls go inside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE LAWN IN FRONT OF THE CHOW HALL - DAY

               Thirty-six chrome dome helmets fly into the air and land on 
               the lawn and then thirty-six starving Poopies rush into line 
               in front of the mess hall, at close-order attention, nose 
               touching the back of the head of the Poopie ahead of them in 
               line.

                                     FOLEY
                         Count off!

               They start the count off. When it gets to Perryman he screws 
               up and gives the wrong number. Foley descends on him.

                                     FOLEY
                         Daydreaming about your wife and kids, 
                         Perryman? You want to join 'em now?

                                     PERRYMAN
                         No, sir!

                                     FOLEY
                         Count off!! From the top.

               This time somebody else fucks up.

               INT. THE MESS HALL - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

               The candidates wait in line with their trays held in both 
               hands directly in front of their faces, STOMACHS GROWLING so 
               loudly we can hear them. Sid whispers to Zack.

                                     SID
                              (softly)
                         I'm so hungry I could die.

               They go through the food line, staring longingly at the shit 
               on a shingle they're being served. Drooling.

               They stand at attention at their table. Foley putting them 
               through a silly drill of slapping their arms together and 
               sinking, as a unit, slowly into their seats. Each time they 
               fail to do it together, Foley makes them start again. Steam 
               rises up from their trays, teasing them cruelly.

               Finally, they get it right.

                                     FOLEY
                         Okay! You got thirty-five seconds to 
                         get that garbage in your belly, bus 
                         your dishes, and get your asses out 
                         of here.

               They go at it like animals, stuffing their faces as fast as 
               they can, Zack the fastest eater of all. He finishes in no 
               time at all and busses his tray. He smiles smugly as he passes 
               Foley and the D.I. reacts.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CROSS-COUNTRY COURSE - THE FIRST - DAY

               Foley runs the candidates over the cross-country course with 
               rifles raised overhead. Sunlight filters through the dense 
               trees that overhang the narrow trail.

                                     FOLEY
                              (jody-calling)
                         Flying low and feeling mean. Spot a 
                         family by a stream. Pickle a pear 
                         and hear'em scream. 'Cause napalm 
                         sticks to kids.

               EXT. CROSS-COUNTRY COURSE - NEAR THE LIGHTHOUSE - DAY

               Foley runs his Poopies through the surf, past the old 
               lighthouse, CAMERA MOVING with Sid, Zack and Casey, near the 
               end of the group.

                                     FOLEY
                         Eighteen kids in a free fire zone. 
                         Books under arms, just walking on 
                         home. Last kid walks home alone. 
                         'Cause napalm sticks to kids.

               Sid glances over his shoulder at Casey, running tiredly behind 
               him.

                                     SID
                         Hey, Seeger, what're you doing in 
                         this program?

                                     CASEY
                              (testy)
                         What's the matter, Worley? Am I 
                         threatening you?

               Zack runs behind Seeger.

                                     ZACK
                         Hey, baby, you could get sent to 
                         war, get your ass shot down.

                                     CASEY
                         Don't lose any sleep over it. I 
                         wouldn't mind being the first woman 
                         to fly a jet fighter in combat.

                                     ZACK
                         Great. You can go in my place.

                                     SID
                              (to Casey)
                         Are you really going for jets?

                                     CASEY
                         Uh-huh. All the way.

                                     SID
                         How about you, Mayo?

                                     ZACK
                         Jets.

                                     SID
                         I hate to tell you guys, but only 
                         two out of every class make it into 
                         jets. Which one of you is going with 
                         me?

               EXT. CROSS-COUNTRY COURSE - THE GUN EMPLACEMENTS - DAY

               Foley stands at the entrance to a dark tunnel, watching the 
               candidates run past.

                                     FOLEY
                         Here's my favorite one now. See if 
                         it ain't your favorite, too.
                              (resuming)
                         Family of gooks sittin' in a ditch, 
                         Baby sucking on her mama's tit. Dow 
                         Chemical don't give a shit, that 
                         napalm sticks to kids.

               CAMERA PANS the last of the candidates through the tunnel.

               ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TUNNEL

               There's a huge, three-story gun emplacement bunker built in 
               1895, that now serves as a torture chamber for aviation 
               officer candidates.

               The other D.I.'s from the program stand at different places 
               on the time-weathered stairs, waiting to assist Foley, their 
               canes propped behind them, truly cruel expressions on their 
               faces.

               On cue from Foley, they begin to P.T. Zack's class into the 
               ground, running them up and down the stairs, shouting in 
               their tender ears until some members of the class actually 
               start passing out.

               An ambulance is there with two enlisted attendants to carry 
               away the casualties.

               Zack, Sid, Casey, Perryman and Topper are starting to show 
               the wear of the arduous "C" course, like the rest of their 
               class.

               As they pass the "finish line" where Foley stands, they all 
               fall on their faces, and lie there, gasping for breath.

               Suddenly, they're distracted by a disquieting sight.

               EXT. OBSTACLE COURSE - DAY

               An advanced class of officer candidates comes running past 
               the exhausted Poopies in smart-looking blue warm-up suits 
               with an insignia and the name "THRAXTON'S COBRAS" on the 
               front and nicknames on the back like: "HOOSIER FACE," "THE 
               BARBER," "ANIMAL HOUSE," "CHOW HOG," "BABY HUEY," AND "THE 
               PROFESSOR."

               CAMERA PANS them to the obstacle course where Thraxton's 
               Cobras start eating up the course like child's play.

               ANGLE - FOLEY AND HIS CLASS

               Foley sneers down at his exhausted Poopies.

                                     FOLEY
                         That's you in thirteen weeks, those 
                         of you who survive. Don't you dare 
                         look at them! You're not worthy enough 
                         to look at them! Della-Serra, I saw 
                         you eyeballing them!

               Zack and the others can't take their eyes off the advanced 
               class. It's literally impossible to imagine ever being that 
               well-conditioned.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. ZACK'S BARRACKS ROOM - NIGHT

               CAMERA MOVES AROUND the room, past Perryman's snoring face, 
               past Sid, tossing fitfully, so exhausted he keeps mumbling, 
               "Yes, sir," over and over in his sleep... finally HOLDING ON 
               Zack, sleeping so lightly that the SOUND OF HISSING near at 
               hand causes his eyes to open, then harden with disgust at 
               what he's seeing.

               Topper stands at the sink, pissing.

                                     ZACK
                         What the fuck're you doing, Topper?

                                     TOPPER
                              (mortified)
                         I'm afraid to go out there, Zack. I 
                         know he'll catch me. He sleeps in 
                         the head, you know.

                                     ZACK
                         He doesn't sleep in the head, man. 
                         He just says those things. Shit! I 
                         just cleaned that sink this morning!

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. THE BARRACKS - DAY (SEVERAL WEEKS LATER)

               Zack comes out of the head, Candidates Della-Serra and Marcus 
               on his heels. Zack wears a white T-shirt and the khaki pants 
               of the uniform they've been issued after "Poopie Week". His 
               shoes are spit-shined to perfection, his belt brassoed to a 
               lustrous shine, and his hair is now about an inch long. He 
               pats it back with his hands, primping.

                                     DELLA-SERRA
                         Another week or two, you'll have 
                         that ducktail back, Mayo.

               He rubs Zack's head and Zack pulls away.

                                     ZACK
                         Hey! I worked on it for thirty 
                         minutes!

               Zack snaps Della-Serra with his towel, spots a couple of 
               female candidates leaving the woman's head, looks around to 
               see if any's watching, and crosses by the stairwell toward 
               Seeger's room.

               INT. SEEGER'S ROOM - DAY

               Zack pushes the door open and stands there, grinning, as 
               Gonzales rushes into her uniform. Seeger just sits there on 
               her bunk, in her khaki pants and a bra, spit-shining her 
               boonies.

                                     ZACK
                         Good morning, girls.

                                     CASEY
                         Ever heard of knocking, mayo?

                                     ZACK
                         Hey, did you hear? Sands and 
                         Kantrowitz DORed last night.
                              (His killer grim)
                         Survival of the fittest.

                                     CASEY
                         The whole world's a jungle, huh, 
                         Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last 
                         one, right?

                                     ZACK
                         You got it, Sweet Pea.
                              (eyeing her breasts)
                         Nice boonies, Seeger.

               Casey smiles easily and Zack pushes off down the corridor.

               ZACK WALKS INTO HIS ROOM

               and finds his roommates rushing around in a frenzy, trying 
               to get squared away. Sid is working like a fool on his boots.

               Perryman is brassoing his belt buckle, and Topper is folding 
               his underwear and T-shirts and then measuring them with a 
               ruler to be certain he has the correct dimensions, before 
               placing them in his locker.

                                     TOPPER
                         Inspection's in five minutes, Mayo! 
                         Give 'em to me.

                                     ZACK
                         Where's your money?

               Topper gives him a fiver. Totally unrushed, Zack gets up on 
               his bunk and starts prying a piece of fiberboard loose from 
               the ceiling.

                                     PERRYMAN
                         You'd better hope Foley never finds 
                         out about that, Mayo.

               Zack pulls the piece of fiberboard free and reaches inside.

               Slaving over his boonies, Sid looks up and sees Zack remove 
               from his stash a perfectly spitshined pair of boonies and 
               hand them down to Topper. Laboring over his belt buckle, 
               Perryman practically drools as he sees the glistening buckle 
               Zack suddenly holds up for him to see.

                                     ZACK
                         Two bucks a buckle, Perryman. Look 
                         at that shine! Boonies'll cost you 
                         five.

                                     PERRYMAN
                         Who's got two bucks? It's costing me 
                         every penny they pay us just to keep 
                         my old Lady and my kids in that motel.

                                     SID
                         Who you got doing all that for you, 
                         man? Some enlisted guy?

               Not one to give away his secrets, Zack just smiles, and 
               replaces the boots and buckle in his stash.

                                     PERRYMAN
                         Hey, man, is the piss-ass money you're 
                         making off this worth the risk of 
                         getting us all kicked out of here on 
                         an honor violation?

                                     ZACK
                         I don't notice anyone else 
                         complaining.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE OBSTACLE COURSE - DAY

               Foley is timing the class over the killer "o" course. While 
               most of his classmates are struggling to complete the course, 
               Zack is breezing through it. As he finished, he moves off by 
               himself, aloof, confident. Foley watches him closely. He's 
               the only one not rooting for his classmates.

               ANGLE - THE TEN-FOOT WALL

               Casey is having a terrible time getting over the wall. She 
               doesn't have the upper-body strength for it. Foley saunters 
               up and watches her futile efforts with a cockeyed little 
               smile.

                                     FOLEY
                         I can tell you right now you're not 
                         gonna make it, Seeger. First, I can't 
                         graduate you unless you make it over 
                         that wall. You gotta have muscles, 
                         Seeger, if you want to fly my jets.

                                     CASEY
                         I'll make it over the wall, sir!

                                     FOLEY
                         Do you want to be a man, Seeger? Is 
                         that why you're here?

                                     CASEY
                         Sir, if it means getting all the 
                         respect a man gets, then yes! I was 
                         told I could find that in the modern 
                         Navy, sir!

               She takes another run at the wall but fails once more to 
               scale it. She sinks to the ground and bites her lip to keep 
               from crying. Still, tears well up in her eyes.

                                     FOLEY
                         That's it! That's exactly what'll 
                         beat you, Seeger... your mental 
                         attitude as a person of the female 
                         persuasion. Under all your bullshit, 
                         you still think like a second class 
                         citizen, Seeger. You could never 
                         give orders to men.

               INT. THE AERODYNAMICS CLASSROOM - DAY

               Zack struggles to comprehend the mumbo-jumbo of higher physics 
               being demonstrated on the blackboard by the instructor, a 
               Navy Lieutenant. All the candidates are using slide rules to 
               work out the difficult problems.

               QUICK CLOSE SHOTS reveal that most of the candidates have a 
               pretty fair facility with the slide rule, but Zack looks 
               like he's never had one in his hand until now.

               EXT. THE BARRACKS - NIGHT

               STARTING CLOSE ON a row of shined boots and a row of shined 
               buckles WE WIDEN to reveal an enlisted sailor and Zack, 
               scrutinizing the boots and buckles spread out on a Navy issue 
               blanket. Zack nods his satisfaction, hands over a wad of 
               currency, and carefully starts folding the edges of the 
               blanket around his booty as the sailor disappears into the 
               darkness. Then, as Zack lifts his Santa's sack of goodies 
               over his shoulder, and turns around to go, he stops suddenly.

               INCLUDE SID

               He stands there in the darkness, a big grin on his face.

                                     SID
                         So that's how you do it.

               Zack looks like a thief caught in the act.

                                     ZACK
                         Hey, you gonna tell anybody about 
                         this?

                                     SID
                              (kidding him)
                         Not if you make it worth my while. 
                         How about free boonies for the 
                         duration?

               Zack smiles, realizing his roommate is putting him on.

                                     ZACK
                         How about you kiss my ass?

               Sid laughs. Together, they head back toward the barracks 
               entrance.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. THE OFFICERS CLUB - REGIMENTAL BALL - NIGHT

               Zack and Sid are part of the line of stubble-haired AOCs in 
               dress white uniforms, watching the door like eagles as a 
               parade of Puget Debs come into the club, wearing satiny 
               formals and hopeful smiles.

               Perryman walks past with his attractive black wife.

               Casey enters in uniform, hand-in-hand with a handsome young 
               Lieutenant JG, her shortened hair brushed back nicely on the 
               sides. She smiles at Zack and he smiles back.

               Topper approaches one of the girls coming through the door, 
               a short, dumpy little girl with jugs the size of watermelons, 
               and escorts her toward the ballroom.

               Then Sid and Zack spot Paula and Lynette coming through the 
               door in clingy little formals, milky-white bosoms pushed up 
               high and little gold crosses dangling in the valley between.

                                     SID
                         Look, Zack. It's them. Holy shit. 
                         Look at that bodacious set of ta-
                         tas.

               They approach the girls where they've stopped to chat with 
               Nellie Rufferwell.

                                     SID
                         Mrs. Rufferwell, ma'am, think you 
                         could introduce us to these attractive 
                         young ladies...?

               Sid immediately fixes his eyes on Lynette. Zack and Paula 
               size each other up as Nellie makes the introductions.

                                     NELLIE
                         Officer Candidate Sid Worley, may I 
                         present Miss Lynette Pomeroy. Miss 
                         Paula Pokrifki, Officer Candidate 
                         Zackary Mayo.
                              (beat)
                         Well, I hope you have a good time.

               She slips off, leaving the foursome along.

                                     ZACK
                              (rubbing his head)
                         You told us it would grow out an 
                         inch.

                                     SID
                              (aside, to Zack)
                         It's grown out more than an inch, 
                         sweetheart.

               Zack stifles a chuckle.

                                     PAULA
                         That was you guys, huh?

                                     LYNETTE
                         Come on. Let's go dance.

               Sid offers her his arm and she takes it with a little smile.

               Zack offers Paula his arm and she takes it, meeting his eyes 
               for an instant.

               INT. THE OFFICERS CLUB - NIGHT

               As they cross the dance floor. A shitty local band is PLAYING 
               embarrassingly loud.

                                     LYNETTE
                         Is this you boys first night of 
                         liberty since you got here?

                                     SID
                         Yes, ma'am. Four long, hard weeks of 
                         sacrifice for my country... for my 
                         people... for you. But I survived.

               ANGLE - THE REFRESHMENT TABLE

               As Sid and Lynette dance, Zack and Paula have some punch at 
               the refreshment table.

                                     ZACK
                         Hey, what kind of name is Pokrifki?

                                     PAULA
                         Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?

                                     ZACK
                         Italian. My mom was Irish. I got her 
                         ears. But the rest is all wop.

                                     PAULA
                         Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?

                                     ZACK
                         Everywhere and nowhere, Paula the 
                         Polack.

                                     PAULA
                         Seriously.

                                     ZACK
                              (straight-faced)
                         My father is a Rear Admiral in the 
                         Seventh Fleet.

                                     PAULA
                         Really?

                                     ZACK
                         Yeah. We've lived all over the world. 
                         Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi.

                                     PAULA
                              (impressed)
                         Really? I've never been out of 
                         Washington except once when I visited 
                         this aunt of mine over to Portland. 
                         I mean, over at Portland. Ain't it 
                         pathetic the way folks talk around 
                         here?

               She suddenly blushes.

                                     PAULA
                         You're putting me on, aren't you? We 
                         don't got no Navy bases in Moscow.

               Zack just smiles.

                                     PAULA
                              (returns his smile)
                         You got a girl?

                                     ZACK
                         No, and I'm not looking for one 
                         either.

               Paula meets his eyes and flirts brazenly.

                                     PAULA
                         Yeah, what are you looking for?

               Zack just grins.

                                     ZACK
                         I hear most of the girls who come to 
                         these things are looking for a 
                         husband.

                                     PAULA
                         Not me.

                                     ZACK
                         Yeah? Why're you here?

                                     PAULA
                         To meet interesting people, improve 
                         myself. You wouldn't believe the 
                         losers we got over in Port Angeles.

                                     ZACK
                         Do you go to school?

                                     PAULA
                         No. I work for National Paper. It's 
                         a good job. I make eight-twenty-three 
                         an hour.
                              (beat)
                         When I get enough money saved, I 
                         plan to go on to college.

               The band surges into a slower ballad.

               ANGLE - SID AND LYNETTE

               As they dance to the slow music, they waste no time with 
               formalities and soon are pushing their bodies together and 
               rubbing in all the best places.

                                     LYNETTE
                         You been through the Dilbert Dunker 
                         yet?

                         went through it and made it, so I 
                         know I can.

                                     LYNETTE
                         Is your brother a flyer?

                                     SID
                         He was. He died.

                         Vietnam?

                                     SID
                         Yeah.

                                     LYNETTE
                         I had a big brother who died over 
                         there, too. He wasn't no flyer though. 
                         He was just your basic Marine Corps 
                         type. I was only twelve when it 
                         happened, so I don't remember much 
                         about him.

                                     SID
                              (somberly)
                         I sure remember Tommy.
                              (beat)
                         Mind if we talked about something 
                         else?

                                     LYNETTE
                              (seductively)
                         We don't have to talk at all.

               VARIOUS SHOTS - AROUND THE DANCE FLOOR

               The horny AOCs from Zack's class are grinding and pushing 
               and falling into the gentle traps being set by the crafty 
               debs.

               Topper buries his nose into the ample cleavage of his deb.

               Della-Serra nibbles on the ear of his gangly partner. Casey 
               and her pilot twirl around the floor.

               ANGLE - PAULA AND ZACK

               As they move onto the dance floor, the handsome pilot, Donny 
               approaches PAULA.

                                     DONNY
                         Hey, PAULA. How about a dance later 
                         on.

                                     PAULA
                         Well... I'm kinda with someone.

               She continues on with Zack.

               NEW ANGLE - PAULA AND ZACK

               Paula puts her arms tight around his neck and nestles her 
               lips close to his ear.

                                     PAULA
                         Think you'll make it all the way to 
                         getting your wings?

                                     ZACK
                         Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than 
                         me are dropping out like flies.

                                     PAULA
                         Just think 'I'm gonna do it!' Program 
                         yourself. See yourself making it. 
                         It'll happen. I know 'cause I just 
                         read this article in Cosmo, and it 
                         was about that very thing.

                                     ZACK
                         You're a very pretty girl, Paula.

               He kisses her once but as he starts to pull away she won't 
               let him and they french shamelessly for a long moment before 
               PAULA pulls away from him, breathing raggedly, her green 
               eyes flashing.

                                     PAULA
                         Let's flee this pit stop, what do 
                         you say?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE LIGHTHOUSE - NIGHT

               The beacon sweeps past the empty Falcon and over the sandy 
               landscape as we hear:

                                     SID (V.O.)
                         Something tells me you've been here 
                         before.

                                     LYNETTE (V.O.)
                         Now what on earth would give you an 
                         idea like that?

               START CLOSE ON LYNETTE'S BUTTONS

               Sid's fingers pop a button in their urgency. Lynette's fingers 
               push his away and she undoes the buttons with ease.

                                     SID
                         You're sure it's okay?

                                     LYNETTE
                         Don't worry. I'll respect you 
                         afterwards.

               The dress disappears, leaving her torso uncovered. Sid's 
               face PUSHES INTO SHOT as he kisses his way down her neck 
               toward her tight little breasts.

                                     SID
                         You're crazy, girl. You'll respect 
                         me. That's great. But what I meant...

               Lynette's face PUSHES INTO SHOT and she kisses him almost 
               roughly.

                                     LYNETTE
                         I told you. I'm on the pill. Don't 
                         worry, Sid. Just do it.

               She pulls him down on top of her.

               THE LIGHT FROM THE LIGHTHOUSE

               sweeps past Zack and PAULA, already making love a distance 
               down the beach.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE BARRACKS HEAD - NIGHT

               The two friends crow about their conquests while they brush 
               their teeth in front of the long mirror.

                                     SID
                         Could you believe those girls!

                                     ZACK
                         'Nellie's Nymphos!'

                                     SID
                         Jesus, that Lynette! I rode her hard 
                         and put her up wet.

               Zack shadowboxes with his reflection in the mirror.

                                     ZACK
                              (clowning)
                         Look out, Foley! I'm ready to take 
                         you on for another week!

               They both laugh.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LYNETTE'S CAR - NIGHT

               Lynette has the accelerator mashed to the floorboard. Paula 
               looks at her wristwatch.

                                     PAULA
                         Hurry, Lynette. It's almost midnight.

                                     LYNETTE
                         I got my foot on the floor.

               EXT. THE FERRY PORT - NIGHT

               The midnight ferry to Port Angeles is just about to pull out 
               when the Falcon comes SCREAMING around the corner and races 
               aboard.

               EXT. FERRY - LONG SHOT - NIGHT

               crossing the Sound.

               INT. THE WHEELHOUSE OF THE FERRY - NIGHT

               The two girls look out across the water. A curious little 
               smile crosses Paula's face and Lynette sees it.

                                     LYNETTE
                         Well, it you're not gonna ask, then 
                         I will. How was it?

                                     PAULA
                         Great.

                                     LYNETTE
                         Details, Pokrif. From what I saw he 
                         had an incredible body.

                                     PAULA
                         Yeah... Mmmm...

                                     LYNETTE
                         What did he do? Did he do anything 
                         that was different?

                                     PAULA
                         Everything was different.

                                     LYNETTE
                         But in what ways?

               Paula looks at her friend as if acknowledging her presence 
               for the first time. A sense of privacy comes over her 
               suddenly.

                                     LYNETTE
                         Did you... come?

               Paula smiles. Lynette could die of envy. You sense she's 
               never known that pleasure.

                                     PAULA
                         How did it go with you guys?

                                     LYNETTE
                         Big Sid came in about two and a half 
                         seconds, then had the nerve to ask, 
                         'Did you make it, too, sweetheart?'

               Said with a certain affection, albeit slightly jaded. Paula 
               laughs.

                                     LYNETTE
                              (resuming softer)
                         ...but I really like him, Paula. And 
                         I know he's going to make it. He 
                         comes from a family of pilots.

               EXT. THE PORT ANGELES FERRY TERMINAL - NIGHT

               The Falcon drives off and proceeds past a local hangout called 
               "Tim's" with a number of motorcycles parked out front. A 
               cluster of good old boys in jeans and T-shirts, lounging in 
               front of "Tim's," see the Falcon and WHISTLE at the girls.

               Lynette gives them the finger.

               INT. THE FALCON - NIGHT

               Both Paula and Lynette respond to the whistles with looks of 
               disgust. Cinderella said it first: the worst part of being a 
               deb is the ride home.

                                     PAULA
                         He ask you out for next weekend?

                                     LYNETTE
                         No, but I told him I'd be at the 
                         Town Tavern next Saturday night, and 
                         he sounded like he might come.

                                     PAULA
                         I told Zack about Saturday night, 
                         too. The fifth week's supposed to be 
                         the roughest. Come Wednesday, he'll 
                         be wishing he took my number.

                                     LYNETTE
                         You hope.

                                     PAULA
                         He'll show. I'd bet my paycheck on 
                         it.

               EXT. PAULA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               A lower-middle class clapboard house sitting on blocks like 
               all the others on the crammed little street.

               Built during the war as cheap housing for servicemen, the 
               box-like dwellings now serve Port Angeles' industrial blue 
               collar families, like Paula's.

               The Falcon drives up and Paula gets out.

                                     LYNETTE
                         See you at church in the morning.

               Paula nods distractedly, her face reflecting genuine fear of 
               what awaits her inside the darkened house.

               INT. PAULA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Her key turns in the lock and the door opens. She tiptoes 
               across the small living room, but as she is passing a door 
               left slightly ajar, a voice inside the room calls out to 
               her, making her jump.

                                     JOE (O.S.)
                         Paula, come in here, please.

               INT. JOE AND ESTHER'S BEDROOM

               JOE POKRIFKI is a tough, barely-literate Polack with enough 
               hair on his chest to compete with some apes. Ester lies in 
               bed beside him. Paula enters the darkened room and Joe 
               suddenly snaps on the light, bathing them all in its harsh, 
               almost police-room glare.

                                     JOE
                         Come over here. I want to look at 
                         you.

               Paula stays near the door, scared.

                                     PAULA
                         I know I'm late and I'm sorry, but 
                         Mrs. Rufferwell asked us to help 
                         with the cleanup and...

                                     JOE
                         I said, come here!

               She slowly approaches him, stopping about halfway.

                                     PAULA
                         Daddy, I don't want to get into 
                         anything with you tonight. I'm tired 
                         and I...

                                     JOE
                         What are you tired from?

                                     ESTHER
                         Joe!

                                     JOE
                         Come over here where I can see you.

               She steps up to the bed and her father looks over her 
               clothing.

                                     JOE
                         Look at the sand! Enough sand to 
                         start your own beach!
                              (seeing something)
                         What's that wet place on your dress?

               Paula is so mortified she could scream. Tears of rage flood 
               her eyes.

               INT. AN ADJOINING BEDROOM

               Paula's two sisters, ages 14 and 10, are awake in their bunks 
               and listening to the confrontation in the next room. The 
               empty lower bunk in the over-crammed room belongs to Paula. 
               There's a stack of Cosmopolitan magazines beside the bed and 
               fan magazine photos of John Travolta taped to the wall above 
               her pillow.

                                     PAULA (O.S.)
                         I don't know what it is. It could be 
                         anything.

                                     JOE (O.S.)
                         But you knew right off what I was 
                         talking about, didn't you, Paula! 
                         Did you let that boy --

               INT. JOE AND ESTER'S BEDROOM

               Paula interrupts her father, enraged by his insinuations. 
               Her mother looks on, haunted by memories of her own.

                                     PAULA
                         Don't you dare ask me that question. 
                         I'm an adult and you got no right to 
                         push your nose into my affairs like 
                         that!

                                     JOE
                         Well, as long as you live in this 
                         house, young lady, you live by my 
                         rules! You should be dating local 
                         boys.

                                     PAULA
                         Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody 
                         in this town doing anything with his 
                         life, except what his father did, 
                         which is nothing. If I can't have 
                         more out of life than that, I'd rather 
                         be dead!

                                     JOE
                         Do you honestly think you'll find a 
                         boy in that... that officer's school 
                         who's serious about marriage?

                                     PAULA
                         Yes I do!

                                     JOE
                         Then you're dumber than I thought! 
                         All you'll get from their kind is 
                         pregnant!

               For an instant, Esther's eyes and her husband's lock in 
               unresolved combat.

                                     PAULA
                         Nothing like that's ever gonna happen.

               To keep from sobbing in front of them, she turns and runs 
               out.

               A terrible silence fills the room, the silence of two 
               miserable human beings condemned to live unhappily ever 
               after... because of one little mistake.

                                     JOE
                         Esther, do you think she's using...
                              (has trouble saying 
                              it)
                         ...birth control?

                                     ESTHER
                         Yes, Joe.

                                     JOE
                         When did this happen?

                                     ESTHER
                         A long time ago.

               INT. PAULA'S BEDROOM

               She changes into her pajamas and crawls into bed. She'd like 
               to cry but there isn't the privacy for it, so she holds it 
               all in. CAMERA PANS the faces of her sisters, both awake.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CATHOLIC CHURCH IN PORT ANGELES - DAY

               Joe Pokrifki parks his big, old Olds Cutlass and the four 
               Pokrifki women follow him toward the church in their prim 
               Sunday dresses.

               Lynette and her three brothers climb down from the back of a 
               dented and primered pickup truck. Lynette's pained skeleton 
               of a mother gets out from behind the wheel and ushers her 
               brood toward the church. There's a shocking difference between 
               the debs who go over to the base on weekends and these primly-
               dressed, almost tomboyishly unmade-up young girls.

               As the two girls see each other, they exchange supportive 
               smiles.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE OLD BLIMP HANGAR - DAY

               Zack and his classmates look around apprehensively as they 
               enter the cavernous old hangar and take seats, along with 
               several other classes from the program, around a raised mat.

               Suddenly, shockingly, a bank of lights directly over the mat 
               go on to illuminate Foley, dressed in a worn and faded pair 
               of black silk pajamas, legs akimbo and arms crossed at the 
               chest.

               Zack elbows Sid.

                                     ZACK
                         Look at Foley! Can you believe it!

                                     SID
                              (frightened)
                         Shhhh...

               Zack looks around and the faces of the others are similarly 
               disquieted by the sight. How do you describe the presence of 
               death in a room? But it's there. Foley brought it in with 
               him.

                                     FOLEY
                         I'm the base martial arts instructor, 
                         so those of you in on-eight must 
                         desist in thinking of me as their 
                         drill instructor for the next sixty 
                         minutes.
                              (grins evilly)
                         Just think of me as... the enemy. 
                         Incidentally, children, I am wearing 
                         the uniform of a Viet Cong foot 
                         soldier I killed in hand-to-hand 
                         combat in Plei Me, Viet Nam... when 
                         I was about your age. Maybe a little 
                         younger.
                              (in the same breath)
                         May I please have a volunteer? How 
                         'bout you, Daniels?

               Topper rises to his feet, terrified, and Sid pats him on the 
               back.

                                     SID
                         Go put him in the hospital, kid.

                                     TOPPER
                         He can't touch me. That's the law.

               Foley grins sadistically as he watches Topper climb up onto 
               the mat.

                                     FOLEY
                         Hello, pussy. How bad do you want to 
                         survive?

               Topper stares at him, then stammers:

                                     TOPPER
                         Sir, this Officer Candidate doesn't 
                         understand what you're asking, sir.

                                     FOLEY
                         Let me see if I can improve your 
                         comprehension.

               He leaps on Topper like a cat, grabbing the boy's throat 
               between his thumb and forefinger, seemingly intent upon 
               killing him but, in reality, scaring him more than actually 
               hurting him that much.

                                     FOLEY
                         Do you want to survive bad enough to 
                         stop me, pussy? Or are you relying 
                         on my generosity, my love of humanity, 
                         to stop me from killing you?!

               Topper's eyes bug in horror.

                                     TOPPER
                         Please... no... I can't breathe...

               Foley just laughs.

               SID AND PERRYMAN

               jump to their feet to protest, but events are moving too 
               fast for them. Zack just sits there, almost amused.

               TOPPER

               finally starts fighting back. Convinced this maniac means to 
               kill him to make his point, he finally summons enough survival 
               instinct to wrestle Foley's hand from his throat. He sinks 
               to the floor of the ring and struggles to catch his breath.

                                     TOPPER
                         You... had... no right! You can't... 
                         touch... us! It's the... law!

               This makes Foley laugh all the harder.

                                     FOLEY
                              (mimicking him)
                         'Sir, this Officer Candidate doesn't 
                         understand what you mean by survival.' 
                         Now do you understand a little better, 
                         pussy? Get out of my sight!

               Topper hurries to comply, while Foley swaggers to the edge 
               of the mat, sits down and starts putting foam safety-kick 
               pads on his feet, really getting off on this.

                                     FOLEY
                         You think I'm a little harsh on your 
                         classmate? Wait 'til you get shot 
                         down behind enemy lines and the only 
                         thing between you and a POW camp is 
                         what you assholes learned from me!
                              (beat)
                         Okay, worms. Now that I've got your 
                         attention, we can begin.

               FOLEY

               demonstrates the basic karate kicks. Beyond black belt, he 
               has moves that ought to bear his name. Leaping, spinning 
               crescent kicks are his specialty, and he executes them like 
               a ballet master, awing everyone in the dank old hangar. Almost 
               everyone. Zack, cool. Zack, is unimpressed.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. THE TOWN TAVERN - NIGHT

               Zack and Sid sit in their white liberty uniforms at the long 
               bar, nursing beers, Sid anxiously watching the door for 
               Lynette, Zack busy flirting with an attractive WAITRESS. The 
               Town Tavern is a local hangout and there's a sense that a 
               number of the townies are watching the boys in white with 
               resentment.

                                     ZACK
                              (to the Waitress)
                         Hey, baby... c'mere...

               She slides up, smiling, giggling.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Nice haircut.

                                     ZACK
                         Kiss it, baby. Make it grow.

               She laughs and kisses the top of his head.

                                     ZACK
                         So, when do you get off?

               She's about to reply when a burly BARTENDER approaches with 
               fresh beers for the boys. He gives the boys a surly look.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Take care of the customers, Doreen.

               Doreen gives Zack her best smile and grudgingly moves off 
               toward the locals around the pool table. The bartender puts 
               fresh beers in front of Sid and Zack.

                                     BARTENDER
                              (surly)
                         That'll be two dollars.

               The boys pay up and the bartender moves off.

                                     SID
                              (facetiously)
                         Nice, hospitable folks they get around 
                         here.
                              (glances at door)
                         I hope she comes.

                                     ZACK
                         She'll come, pard. A rich socialite 
                         Oakie like you oughta be a big catch 
                         around these parts.

                                     SID
                         Get off my case, Mayo. I didn't grow 
                         up rich.

               SEXY ENOUGH TO LIGHT FIRES, PAULA AND LYNETTE

               cut a path like Sherman's army through the gawking local 
               losers clustered inside the door of the tavern, then glide 
               into Zack and Sid's arms and kiss them gluttonously for half 
               a minute. Some of the local boys watch it all with ill-
               concealed jealousy.

                                     ZACK
                         I think we're making some of the 
                         locals jealous.

                                     PAULA
                         Who cares?
                              (frenching him)
                         Mmmm. Now I remember. Mayo the Wop. 
                         Gee, I'm glad you're here. I've been 
                         looking forward to this all week.

                                     ZACK
                         Me, too.

               They kiss again.

                                     SID
                         What would you girls like to do? 
                         Want to stick around here for a little 
                         or... or could I suggest another 
                         plan...?

                                     LYNETTE
                         Like pick up some booze and go to a 
                         motel?

                                     SID
                         Or we could do that yeah.

                                     PAULA
                         I vote for the motel.

                                     ZACK
                         My kinda group!

               They start for the door, all four linking arms.

               NEAR THE DOOR

               One of the boys who was watching them, TROY, 25, jostles 
               into Zack, then pretends it was the other way around.

                                     TROY
                         Hey, make way for the warmongers.

               Zack and Sid spin around, surprised. Troy's a big, kid, a 
               dockworker probably, and he seems to tower over Zack.

                                     ZACK
                         What did you call us?

                                     TROY
                         I called you a warmonger. Ain't that 
                         what you are?

               Zack looks more amused by it all than threatened. He shakes 
               his head and starts out the door with his friends. Troy and 
               some of the other locals share a look, and follow.

               EXT. "THE TOWN TAVERN" - NIGHT

               Troy jobs out of the place and plants himself in front of 
               Zack.

                                     TROY
                         Hey, let me ask you something.

                                     ZACK
                         Yeah, what do you want to know?

                                     SID
                         Let's get out of here Zack.

               A circle is forming around Zack and Troy. Paula looks 
               frightened. Lynette looks turned on.

                                     TROY
                         You come here for a couple of months -- 
                         you rich college boys -- struttin' 
                         around in your ice cream suits like 
                         you own the goddamn place -- fucking 
                         our best women... Hey, who do you 
                         think gets left holding the bag after 
                         you're off flying around the world?

                                     ZACK
                         Hey, pard, why don't you go back 
                         inside and cool off.

               He turns away from Troy and pushes out of the circle.

                                     TROY
                         Hey, I'm not finished talking to 
                         you, sailor boy!

               He charges after Zack, and knocks his cap off.

               VARIOUS SHOTS OF THE FIGHT

               If you can call it a fight. Zack turns around and hits Troy 
               in the face with two very fast punches, a left and a right.

               Before his assailant can recover, Zack delivers a strange, 
               roundhouse kind of kick that seems to come out of him in 
               slow motion, then gathers incredible speed, until it's 
               slamming with the force of a mule-kick into Troy's face. 
               Troy goes down gushing blood from flattened nostrils.

               ZACK

               looks around the other locals who clustered earlier around 
               their champion, but they're all staring at him, afraid.

               Taking Paula by the hand, he leads the foursome away.

               MOVING WITH ZACK, PAULA, LYNETTE AND SID

               Zack stares straight ahead, lost in the world of his 
               adolescence. Paula just watches him, sensitive to the place 
               he's in.

                                     LYNETTE
                         God! I've never seen anything like 
                         that in my whole life! Did you see 
                         that guy's nose?

                                     ZACK
                              (snaps)
                         Lynette, just keep your mouth shut 
                         until we get to the motel. Will you 
                         do that for me, please.

                                     LYNETTE
                         Well, excuse me for livin'!

               Sid pushes her into the car.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ZACK'S ROOM AT THE TIDES INN MOTEL - NIGHT

               Zack lies on the bed, aloof, brooding, and doing some serious 
               drinking from a pint bottle of rum. Paula watches from a 
               chair.

                                     PAULA
                         Want a back rub? Might make you feel 
                         better.

               She climbs onto the bed and tries to position herself to rub 
               his back, but he pulls away.

                                     ZACK
                         I shouldn't have done that. I 
                         should've walked.

                                     PAULA
                         He didn't give you much choice.

                                     ZACK
                         There's always a choice.

                                     PAULA
                         Where'd you learn to fight like that?

                                     ZACK
                              (snaps)
                         I don't feel like talking, if you 
                         don't mind.

                                     PAULA
                              (angry)
                         Opening up just a little wouldn't 
                         kill you, ya know.

               She starts for the door. Zack barely even looks up.

                                     ZACK
                         You want me to fuck you? Is that it? 
                         Okay, come here. Take your clothes 
                         off. Get into bed.

                                     PAULA
                              (turns, angry)
                         Where's that coming from? I wouldn't 
                         fuck now if my life depended on it!

                                     ZACK
                         Forget it. Just get out of here.

               Paula starts to leave, then turns back, furious.

                                     PAULA
                              (explodes)
                         I don't know who you think you're 
                         talking to! I ain't some whore you 
                         brought here! I've been trying to be 
                         your friend and you treat me like

                                     ZACK
                         Be a friend. Leave.

                                     PAULA
                         You got no manners and you never 
                         tell the truth! You're nothin' 
                         special. And if you ask me, you got 
                         no chance at all of being an officer!

               Zack rises from the bed and very slowly approaches her. Paula 
               almost flinches as he stops a few feet away. Then he leans 
               forward and kisses her as gently as he knows how. Very 
               tentatively, she responds.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. THE TIDES INN - NIGHT

               Lynette leaves her room and knocks on Paula's door. Paula 
               comes out, zipping up her dress.

                                     LYNETTE
                              (smiles)
                         A definite improvement.

               They drive off.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. ZACK'S ROOM AT THE TIDES INN - DAY

               He wakes up and slowly focuses on Paula, cooking eggs and 
               bacon in the kitchenette.

                                     ZACK
                         You stayed after all.

                                     PAULA
                         Wrong. I've driven a hundred and 
                         twenty miles, told a hundred and 
                         twenty lies, and said a hundred and 
                         twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. 
                         Hungry?

                                     ZACK
                         I'm starving.

               He jumps out of bed, pulls on some boxer shorts and sits 
               down at a small rickety table she has beautified with 
               wildflowers stuffed in a glass. Paula puts his steaming 
               breakfast before him and stands back to watch him attack it. 
               He looks up at her and finds her staring at him almost 
               wistfully.

                                     ZACK
                         Paula, I never try to fool anybody 
                         about who I am, what I want... so if 
                         even in the back of your --

                                     PAULA
                         I know who you are and what you want.

                                     ZACK
                         What do you want, Paula? What do you 
                         really want?

                                     PAULA
                         To have a good time with you until 
                         you have to go.

                                     ZACK
                         That's it?

               She nods and turns away, so he can't see her eyes and know 
               how much she's lying. Zack finishes off his eggs and bacon, 
               downs his coffee. As she comes over to refill his cup, he 
               unbuttons her blouse and starts playing with her nipples.

                                     ZACK
                         Mmmm. Last night was fantastic.

               She watches him with womanly eyes, aware of her own power.

                                     PAULA
                         Zack, am I your fantasy?

               Zack laughs.

                                     PAULA
                         Zack, I dare you not to fall in love 
                         with me. I ain't gonna get serious 
                         with you, no way. But how can you 
                         resist me? I'm like candy.

                                     ZACK
                         You're better than candy.

                                     PAULA
                         I'm serious. It's gonna be hard to 
                         get enough.

               He starts tickling her and she can't sustain her vamp role 
               any longer.

                                     ZACK
                         Getting cocky, aren't you? Huh, you 
                         little Polack? Getting feisty on me, 
                         huh?

               He takes her in his arms and they kiss. The moment turns 
               suddenly real and Zack finds himself pulling away, afraid of 
               the feelings that are churning his guts. Paula studies him a 
               moment.

                                     PAULA

                         something or do you just... disappear?

                                     ZACK
                         I've never had a girl.

               Their eyes stay together for a long time.

                                     ZACK
                         I forgot to thank you for breakfast.

               INT. THE LARGE INDOOR POOL ON THE BASE - DAY

               Our CAMERA is the first to ride the Dilbert Dunker, and we 
               are suddenly shooting at high speed down a steep incline 
               inside a cage-like contraption, painted red. Wham! We hit 
               water at neck-wrenching speed and go under in a swirl of 
               bubbles!

               Wait! What's happening? The goddamn cage is turning 
               somersaults! Which way is up? Which is way up?? A strange 
               looking alien in a wet suit and mask knifes TOWARD US. His 
               hands work to extricate us. We rush toward the promise of 
               light and air at the surface. We can hear our own tortured 
               breathing. Will we make it?

               CANDIDATE DELLA-SERRA REACHES THE SURFACE

               gasping for air. The DILBERT DUNKER INSTRUCTOR stands off to 
               the side, giving him a thumb's down.

                                     INSTRUCTOR
                         Back in line. That was totally unsat, 
                         Della-Serra!

               Della-Serra clings to the side of the pool and vomits. He's 
               grateful to be alive.

               ZACK WATCHES THEM RAISE THE DILBERT DUNKER

               It finally comes to a rest high in the rafters of the 
               building, where he is to be the next to take the ride. Sid 
               and Seeger are right behind him, followed by Topper. He steps 
               into the cage and the Instructor makes sure he's buckled 
               snugly into the harness. Then Zack's eyes fall on:

               FOLEY, STANDING POOL SIDE ZACK LOOKS AWAY FROM HIM AND GIVES 
               HIS THUMBS UP

               and the Dunker takes him on its crazy ride, plummeting down 
               the tracks, blasting into the water, somersaulting...

               UNDERWATER - ZACK

               waits until the turning has stopped, studies the direction 
               his air bubbles are taking as he unfastens his harness, and 
               pulls himself down and out of the Dunker.

               BACK ON THE SURFACE - ZACK

               gets a thumbs up from the Instructor and grins. As he's 
               climbing out, he watches Sid take the big ride.

               UNDERWATER - SID

               almost loses his composure when the harness at first defies 
               his efforts to get it open. Then, he's free and surface-bound.

               AS ZACK HELPS HIM

               out of the pool, Sid's efforts at a cocky grin fails to hide 
               from his friend the fear he felt under there.

                                     ZACK
                         You okay?

                                     SID
                         Sure.

               They turn to watch Casey.

               STAY ON CASEY'S EXHILARATED FACE AS SHE PLUNGES

               and watch her extricate herself as easily as Zack.

               AS ZACK AND SID HELP HER OUT OF THE WATER

               her eyes are wild with excitement.

                                     CASEY
                         Think they'll let us do that again? 
                         God, that was fun!

               TOPPER CLIMBS INTO THE DILBERT DUNKER

               He looks down at the pool far below. His three friends, 
               standing pool side, give him a thumbs up for encouragement, 
               but Topper is too frightened to acknowledge them. He turns 
               to the Instructor helping to fasten him inside the 
               contraption.

                                     TOPPER
                              (scared shitless)
                         Does this thing hit with the same 
                         impact as an actual plane?

                                     INSTRUCTOR
                         This is nothing compared to a plane.
                              (beat)
                         Don't forget to watch the bubbles.

               Topper nods and gives a thumbs up.

               IN A PERCH ABOVE THE RAISED DUNKER

               a young seaman apprentice flicks a switch and the Dunker 
               lurches down the tracks.

               TOPPER SUCKS IN HIS BREATH, TERRIFIED

               The impact of hitting the water is so jolting, it knocks his 
               wind out in a rush and he goes under already screaming that 
               silent little scream of the mind that drowning people hear.

               Underwater, the Dunker turns him over and over, leaving him 
               upside-down. The silent scream is louder. Panic rides its 
               frequency as Topper tears at the lever that would release 
               him from the harness. He gets it open and pushes out of the 
               opening in the Dunker with all his might. He has forgotten 
               to watch for his air bubbles. Top is bottom and bottom is 
               top.

               He smashes violently into the tiled floor of the pool, freaks 
               out, and swims straight up and into the jaws of the Dunker 
               again.

               ZACK, SID, CASEY AND FOLEY

               watch from pool side, concerned, as the diver goes down for 
               Topper.

               UNDERWATER

               The instant the diver is within grasp of the totally unstrung 
               boy, Topper grabs him in a dying man's grip that even the 
               brawny frogman is unable to break.

               The diver hits him once, twice, but Topper clings to him 
               even tighter and, as they wrestle, the harness further snares 
               them both. The scream now becomes the scream of two drowning 
               men.

               INTERCUT THE FACES OF THE ONLOOKERS

               Seconds are ticking by, and it reflects on all the faces in 
               the huge room.

               SUDDENLY FOLEY DIVES, FULLY CLOTHED, INTO THE POOL

               His Smokey the Bear hat and cane stay at the surface as he 
               knifes down through the water toward the churning humanity 
               below.

               UNDERWATER - FOLEY REACHES TOPPER AND THE DIVER

               Both men are so hopelessly entangled in the parachute harness 
               and so close to losing consciousness that Foley has to move 
               very fast. His presence of mind is so total it's frightening.

               With no wasted moves, he frees both men and pulls them toward 
               the surface.

               AT THE SURFACE

               The Instructor helps Foley get them laid out by the side of 
               the pool and while Foley works mouth-to-mouth on Topper, he 
               works on the diver. The diver is easily revived but Topper 
               required everything Foley has to offer. He might have died 
               in less expert hands but Foley is slowly pulling him through.

               INTERCUT - ZACK, SID, PERRYMAN, SEEGER AND OTHERS

               watching Foley's efforts to revive their compatriot.

               FINALLY, FOLEY STEPS AWAY FROM TOPPER

               and nods to the room of onlookers that he'll be all right.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE BARRACKS ROOM - DAY

               CAMERA MOVES DOWN the row of lockers. Sid's is a study in 
               neatness, every pair of skivvies folded identically and 
               measured with a ruler, which is exactly what he's doing at 
               the moment. Perryman's problem is his belt buckle, which he 
               is frantically trying to shine before Foley gets there. Zack 
               stands casually by his locker, buffing his fingernails, his 
               shoes and buckle shined to perfection, as always.

               CAMERA HOLDS on the fourth locker, the one that belonged to 
               Topper Daniels. The door to the locker is open and it's empty.

                                     PERRYMAN
                         I'll never get it polished in time. 
                         Give me a buckle, Zack.

                                     ZACK
                         I can't risk it.

                                     PERRYMAN
                         You'd make it. He's just getting to 
                         the girls. Come on, Zack. I gotta 
                         see my family, man. I couldn't take 
                         it if he keeps me here over the 
                         weekend.

                                     ZACK
                         Sorry, pard. Wouldn't want you to 
                         get an honor violation.

               Sid gives him a dirty look but Zack ignores it. The SOUND OF 
               HARSH FOOTSTEPS approaching and the three candidates snap to 
               rigid attention by their lockers.

               Foley walks in and starts inspecting Perryman. Sweat runs 
               down the black's face in rivers. Foley moves on to Sid, checks 
               out his locker, then turns to Zack.

                                     FOLEY
                         In every class there's a guy who 
                         thinks he's smarter than me. In this 
                         class, it's you, isn't it, Mayonnaise?

               He brings his cane up suddenly, like a majorette's baton, 
               and with one poke knocks the piece of fiberboard out of it's 
               place in the ceiling, allowing two pairs of shined boonies, 
               a half-dozen freshly-brassoed belt buckles, and a little 
               black book recording the monies owed him, to rain down.

                                     FOLEY
                         Report to my office in five minutes!

               Foley turns and strides out. Zack meets his roommates' eyes 
               for an instant, knowing he's finished. Perryman doesn't look 
               too sad about it. He whispers in Zack's ear as he walks past, 
               enroute to the door.

                                     PERRYMAN
                         Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

               Zack stares daggers at him.

               INT. FOLEY'S OFFICE IN THE BARRACKS - DAY

               Foley is doing paperwork at his desk as Zack approaches and 
               knocks on the door.

                                     FOLEY
                         Come in, Mayo.

               Zack enters and stands at attention in front of Foley's desk.

               He knows it's all over.

                                     FOLEY
                         I want your D.O.R.

                                     ZACK
                         No, sir. You can kick me out, but 
                         I'm not quitting.

                                     FOLEY
                         Get into your fatigues, Mayo. Before 
                         the weekend's out, you'll quit.

               Zack salutes, makes a smart turn, and marches out.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE BEACH - DAY

               Foley is putting Zack through hell. With his heavy rifle 
               raised overhead and a full pack on his back, he runs through 
               the wet sand at the beach, to the cadence of his D.I.'s jody 
               call. Foley runs with him a vulture waiting for the 
               inevitable.

                                     FOLEY
                              (jody-calling)
                         Casey Jones was a son of a bitch. 
                         Drove his train in a thirty-foot 
                         ditch. Came on out with his dick in 
                         his hand. Said, 'Listen, ladies, I'm 
                         one helluva man. I went to his room 
                         and lined up a hundred. Swore up and 
                         down he'd
                              (beat)
                         Having fun, Mayonnaise?

               Zack is dying under his heavy helmet, but he says nothing.

               EXT. THE GUN EMPLACEMENTS - LATER THAT DAY (NOON)

               Foley is running him up and down the weathered old steps, 
               the hot sun beating down on him like a firey fist.

                                     FOLEY
                         Look over there, Mayo. She stayed to 
                         do that instead of going on liberty.

               Zack follows his gaze to the Obstacle Course where Seeger is 
               struggling to pull herself over the ten-foot wall, with the 
               same results as last time.

                                     FOLEY
                         She may not make it through the 
                         program, but she's got more heart 
                         and more character than you'll ever 
                         have. I've seen your college record. 
                         I've never heard of most of those 
                         schools. Tell me something, Mayo. 
                         Did you buy that degree?

                                     ZACK
                         No, sir! It was the hardest thing I 
                         ever did, sir! Until this.

                                     FOLEY
                         That's a lie, Mayo. You've gone 
                         through a lot worse, haven't you?

               Zack shoots him a quick look, wondering how much he knows.

                                     FOLEY
                         Stop eyeballing me, mister! I've 
                         looked through your file and done a 
                         little checking, and I know it all. 
                         I know about your mother. I know 
                         your old man's an alcoholic and a 
                         whore chaser.
                              (beat)
                         Life sure has dealt you some shitty 
                         cards! Hasn't it, Mayo?

                                     ZACK
                         I'm doing okay, sir.

                                     FOLEY
                         No you're not. You're failing the 
                         big one, baby, and I don't just mean 
                         in here. I mean in life. I've watched 
                         you, Mayo, and you don't mesh. You 
                         grab-ass and joke around but you 
                         don't make friends, not the way the 
                         others do.

               Zack says nothing but Foley's getting to him in ways nobody 
               has in years, if ever.

                                     FOLEY
                         Want to know why I'm not an officer, 
                         Mayo? Because I have a servile 
                         mentality from growing up poor... 
                         from always being the kid on the 
                         windy side of the baker's window.
                         That's your problem, Mayo. That's 
                         why you don't mesh. Because deep 
                         down in that bitter little heart of 
                         yours, you know these other boys and 
                         girls are better than you.

               EXT. THE LIGHTHOUSE - NIGHT

               Foley is putting Mayo through his rifle drills, in the 
               sweeping light from the old tower. Zack's jaw is set with 
               determination but Foley won't let up.

                                     FOLEY
                         Shoulder arms! Port arms! Parade 
                         rest!
                              (Etc. Etc.)

               EXT. THE GUN EMPLACEMENT - THE NEXT DAY

               Zack lies prone at the top of the bunker, his feet about six 
               inches off the ground, Foley standing over him, smiling.

                                     FOLEY
                         Hey, what do you say we call off 
                         this little charade of yours over a 
                         couple of beers at Trader Jon's...? 
                         Come on, man. You're about as close 
                         to being officer material as me.

                                     ZACK
                         Sir, this candidate believes he'll 
                         make a good officer, sir!

                                     FOLEY
                         No way, Mayo. You don't give a shit 
                         about anybody but yourself and every 
                         single one of your classmates knows 
                         it. Think they'd trust you behind 
                         the controls of a plane they have to 
                         fly in? Hey, man, I figure you for 
                         the kind of guy who'd zip off one 
                         day in my F-14 and sell it to the 
                         Cubans.

                                     ZACK
                         Sir, that's not true! I love my 
                         country!

                                     FOLEY
                              (laughs)
                         Sell it to the Air Force, Mayo!

               Foley puts his lips close to Zack's ear and whispers:

                                     FOLEY
                         Let's get down to it. Why would a 
                         slick little hustler like you sign 
                         up for this kind of abuse?

               Zack's legs are shaking wildly with the effort to keep them 
               aloft.

                                     ZACK
                         I want to fly, sir!

                                     FOLEY
                         That's no reason. Everybody wants to 
                         fly. My grandmother wants to fly. 
                         You going after a job with one of 
                         the airlines?

                                     ZACK
                         I want to fly jets, sir!

                                     FOLEY
                         Why? Because you can do it alone?

                                     ZACK
                         No, sir!

                                     FOLEY
                         What is it, the kicks? Is that it?

                                     ZACK
                         I don't want to do something anybody 
                         can do.

                                     FOLEY
                         Pity you don't have the character.

                                     ZACK
                         That's not true, sir! I've changed a 
                         lot since I've been here! And I'm 
                         gonna make it, sir!

                                     FOLEY
                         Not a fucking chance, asshole!

               Zack bolts up suddenly, meeting his eyes.

                                     ZACK
                              (defiantly)
                         I got nothing else to fall back on. 
                         Sir! This is it for me... and I'm 
                         gonna do it!

               Foley studies him with squinty eyes.

                                     FOLEY
                         All right, Mayo. Get on your feet.

               Both men get up and start walking back toward the base.

               MOVING WITH THEM

               Suddenly they both see a sailboat tacking past, no more than 
               fifty yards off shore.

               THEIR POV - THE SAILBOAT

               There are three people in the boat, two girls and a boy 
               wearing a sack over his head. All three wave in their 
               direction. On cue, they turn around, drop their drawers, and 
               give a three-way B.A. They pull their pants back up and turn 
               around to yell at Zack. The girls are obviously Paula and 
               Lynette. The boy with the sack over his head just has to be 
               Sid.

                                     SID
                              (disguising his voice)
                         Don't give up the ship, Mayo!

                                     PAULA
                         Hang in there, Zack!

                                     LYNETTE
                         Damn the torpedoes and remember the 
                         Tides Inn Motel!

               They're all three laughing so hard they nearly capsize.

               ANGLE - ZACK AND FOLEY

               The drill instructor is amused but trying not to show it.

                                     FOLEY
                         Mayo, are those your friends?

                                     ZACK
                         Yes, sir!

                                     FOLEY
                         Maybe there's hope for you yet.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. THE BARRACKS - DAY

               Zack is on his hands and knees, scrubbing the floor, when 
               Sid, Perryman and some of the others return from liberty.

                                     PERRYMAN
                              (still angry)
                         I see you didn't DOR, Mayo.

                                     ZACK
                         Hey, Sid, thanks.

               PERRYMAN WALKS INTO THEIR ROOM

               and stops as he sees the peace offering on his bed: his boots, 
               shined to perfection, and two gleaming belt buckles. Sid 
               comes in a second later and they share a look.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. THE BARRACKS ROOM - THAT NIGHT

               All three candidates lie awake in their bunks.

                                     ZACK
                         Hey, you guys still awake?

                                     SID
                         Yeah.

               A grunt from Perryman.

                                     ZACK
                         Hey, do you guys ever... feel like 
                         you don't belong here...?

                                     PERRYMAN
                         Yeah. All week long.

                                     SID
                         What's the matter, Sweet Pea. Foley 
                         finally starting to get to you?

                                     ZACK
                         Naw.

                                     PERRYMAN
                         You know what he was running on me 
                         all last week? He told me I wasn't 
                         officer material because I think 
                         black and I'd never get comfortable 
                         giving orders to whites.

                                     SID
                         Yeah? He's been telling me I'm not 
                         officer material because I'm not 
                         inner-directed. He thinks I'm here 
                         for my folks... and for my brother.

                                     ZACK
                         That isn't true, is it?

                                     SID
                         A little.

               Zack shakes his head, impressed.

                                     ZACK
                         How about that prick! He told me he 
                         wasn't officer material because he 
                         grew up poor like me.

                                     PERRYMAN
                         He said he grew up poor?

                                     ZACK
                         The kid on the windy side of the 
                         baker's window. That's how he put 
                         it.

                                     PERRYMAN
                         Foley's not poor. Buddy of mine in 
                         oh-four told me he's the son of a 
                         rich doctor down in Louisiana.

                                     SID
                         Oh yeah? Friend of mine in oh-two 
                         told me he comes from a long line of 
                         Baptist ministers from Georgia.

               All three candidates crack up.

                                     ZACK
                         How about that prick!

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. ZACK AND PAULA'S ROOM AT THE TIDES INN - DAY

               They are making love. When it's over, they lie there for a 
               long time in one another's arms, flagrantly satisfied, and 
               still joined.

                                     ZACK
                         That was great.

                                     PAULA
                         It sure was.

               They share a little smile of satisfaction. They chuckle. The 
               longer they stay together, like that, the more painfully 
               intimate the moment becomes.

                                     PAULA
                         Want me to get a towel?

                                     ZACK
                         I'll get it if you want.

                                     PAULA
                         I don't want you to move.

                                     ZACK
                         I don't want to move. But somebody 
                         has to move sometime. Eventually.

                                     PAULA
                         They found them like that, shriveled 
                         up from weeks without food or water...

               Zack laughs and the connection is nearly broken. Suddenly, 
               Zack just takes her face in his hands and kisses her in a 
               most loving way.

                                     ZACK
                         All week I kept thinking about you 
                         guys in that sailboat.

               He laughs.

                                     PAULA
                         We were pretty drunk.

               Paula takes his officer-style cap and puts it on.

                                     PAULA
                         You know, sometimes I wish I was one 
                         of those girls they're letting in 
                         the flight program these days. God, 
                         I'd love to fly.

                                     ZACK
                         What's stopping you?

               Paula seems to consider it for a moment, then she shakes her 
               head. It's a fantasy, that's all, far removed from the 
               realities of her life.

                                     PAULA
                         I don't care what the magazines say... 
                         it's just not as easy being a girl, 
                         especially from a Catholic family. 
                         You don't know the junk I grew up 
                         listening to, 'bout the way women 
                         are supposed to think and act.

                                     ZACK
                         That's no excuse for not going after 
                         what you want.

                                     PAULA
                         Who says I'm not going after what I 
                         want? My mother's thirty-nine years 
                         old and she still works in that 
                         factory. Every time I see her, I 
                         know exactly what I don't want.

               They share a stretch of silence, Zack retreating into himself, 
               his eyes somehow far away.

                                     ZACK
                              (after a silence)
                         My old lady swallowed a bottle of 
                         pills one day while I was at school.

                                     PAULA
                         God.

                                     ZACK
                         The thing that really got to me... 
                         she didn't leave a note. Nothing. 
                         I've always hated her for that.

                                     PAULA
                         Does it still hurt?

                                     ZACK
                         Naw. You're alone in this world no 
                         matter what kinda folks or background 
                         you had. Nothing hurts, pard, once 
                         you got that one down.

               Paula studies him a long moment.

                                     PAULA
                         I bet most people believe you when 
                         you feed 'em that line.

               He looks at her and smiles, then she kisses him.

               EXT. THE AIR SHOW - DAY

               Six jets fly DIRECTLY AT US, jolting our senses.

               ON INTERCOM

               The program consists of six aircraft performing a sequence 
               of maneuvers in one of three different components: a diamond 
               of four aircraft, two solo aircraft that oppose each other 
               along the line of flight, and all six aircraft in a delta 
               formation.

               CAMERA PANS ZACK AND PAULA

               as they enter and move toward the bleachers where Sid and 
               Lynette are already seated. Zack suddenly stops and scans 
               the bleachers, looking for somebody.

                                     ZACK
                         I'm sorry. I can't sit with you.

                                     PAULA
                         I understand. Maybe we'll see each 
                         other after the show...

               ANGLE - BYRON MAYO

               He sits in the bleachers about ten rows higher than Lynette, 
               Sid and Paula. Zack slides into the seat beside him.

                                     ZACK
                         How're you doing, pard?

               Byron's eyes are on Paula.

                                     BYRON
                         Who's that?

                                     ZACK
                         Nobody. Just a girl I've been making 
                         it with the last couple of weekends.

                                     BYRON
                         Great ass.

                                     ZACK
                         Yeah, I sort of thought so myself.

                                     BYRON
                         Better watch out for that kind, 
                         Zackie. You know what they call 'em, 
                         don't ya?

                                     ZACK
                         Yeah, I know.

                                     BYRON
                         Back east in Newport, Rhode Island, 
                         they call 'em the Fall River Debs. 
                         In Pensacola, the Mobile Debs. In 
                         Norfolk --

                                     ZACK
                         That what she was... a Norfolk Deb?

                                     BYRON
                         Who?
                              (realizing)
                         Aw shit, Zackie, let's not get off 
                         on your mother again, please.

                                     ZACK
                              (testy)
                         What if I want to talk about her, 
                         pard? What then? You know, that's 
                         all I've ever heard from you, since 
                         I was a kid... you never want to 
                         talk about that, man, and it's 
                         important.

                                     BYRON
                         There's nothing to talk about. Two 
                         goddamn times I made it with your 
                         old lady. We barely even talked.

               The JETS ROAR close overhead and Zack has to raise his voice 
               to be heard.

                                     ZACK
                         That's not how she told it. She said 
                         you wrote her every week you were 
                         away.

                                     BYRON
                         I wrote. Not every week...

                                     ZACK
                         She said you told her in every letter 
                         how much you loved her, how you wanted 
                         to marry her, have children with 
                         her...

                                     BYRON
                         I never said any of that!

                                     ZACK
                         I found them, pard, and read them 
                         myself, right after she did it!

                                     BYRON
                              (beat)
                         Okay, I wrote those things... and 
                         yeah, I had big thoughts of getting 
                         together with your mom... but when 
                         she hit me with being pregnant, I 
                         saw who she was. I'd had quiff lay 
                         that shit on me before!

                                     ZACK
                              (suddenly livid)
                         What did you call her? What did I 
                         hear you call her, you son of a bitch?

               Both men rise angrily to their feet, but a split second later 
               the Angels are making another pass over the stands and 
               everyone is standing and applauding, making their argument 
               less public.

                                     ZACK
                              (screaming above the 
                              noise)
                         She loved you, you bastard! And she 
                         believed you when you said you loved 
                         her! She never gave up thinking you'd 
                         come back
                              (beat)
                         Don't you ever talk about her like 
                         that again or I'll kill you, Byron!

               Zack pushes toward the exit, shaking with anger.

               ANGLE - PAULA

               watching him and suddenly rising to follow.

               EXT. THE PARKING LOT AT THE AIR SHOW - DAY

               Zack is halfway to his parked motorcycle when Paula suddenly 
               appears, running after him.

                                     PAULA
                         Zack, wait.

               He keeps walking but she overtakes him.

                                     PAULA
                         What's the matter?

                                     ZACK
                         Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula.

                                     PAULA
                         I've seen all that a hundred times.

                                     ZACK
                              (snaps)
                         Hey, will you just leave me alone?

               Paula stops, hurt. Zack keeps on walking toward his bike.

                                     PAULA
                              (angrily)
                         Yeah, I'll leave you alone! How about 
                         forever? That long enough for you?

               She stomps off in the opposite direction.

               MOVING WITH PAULA

               She fights her tears but they well up in her eyes anyway. 
               The SOUND of Zack STARTING HIS MOTORCYCLE, then he comes 
               rumbling up beside her, smiling apologetically. Paula won't 
               even look at him. She just keeps walking. So he motors around 
               in front of her again, blocking her path. She tries to go 
               around him but again he cuts her off.

                                     ZACK
                              (suddenly)
                         Hey, isn't it about time you had me 
                         over for Sunday dinner?

               Paula looks at him like he's crazy.

                                     ZACK
                         Come on. Invite me. All day the idea 
                         of a family Sunday dinner's been 
                         coming into my head. Since you're 
                         the only one I know around here with 
                         family...

                                     PAULA
                         Zack, I don't know if I want to do 
                         that...

               At that moment, Sid and Lynette come walking up from the 
               show.

                                     LYNETTE
                         C'mon, Paula. We'd better get back.

               Paula starts off with her friend.

                                     ZACK
                         Hey, what about Sunday dinner? When're 
                         you gonna let me know?

                                     PAULA
                              (turns to him)
                         When I'm good and ready.

               She gets into the Falcon with Lynette and they drive off.

               NEW ANGLE - SID AND ZACK

               Zack revs his motorcycle.

                                     SID
                         What's a matter, Sweet Pea? We'll 
                         have a little fuss?

               Sid gets on behind him and they drive off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ABOARD THE FERRY - DAY

               Paula and Lynette leave the wheelhouse, carrying cups of 
               coffee, and we TRACK with them to the back of the ferry.

                                     LYNETTE
                         You serious about having him over?

                                     PAULA
                         I haven't made up my mind.

               CAMERA HOLDS as they reach the fantail and look back at the 
               lights of Port Ranier.

                                     LYNETTE
                         Paula, how far would you go to catch 
                         Zack?

                                     PAULA
                         What do you mean?

                                     LYNETTE
                         You know what I mean. Would you... 
                         let yourself get pregnant?

                                     PAULA
                         No way... Would you?

                                     LYNETTE
                         I never used to think I'd do something 
                         like that, but now I'm not so sure. 
                         You ask me, nine weeks just ain't 
                         long enough to get a guy to fall in 
                         love with you.

                                     PAULA
                         That don't justify trying to trap a 
                         boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! 
                         Nothing justifies that. I can't 
                         believe you're even thinking like 
                         that. I mean, that's really backward.

                                     LYNETTE
                         No more backward, if you ask me, 
                         than the way these hotshot assholes 
                         fuck us, then ditch us.
                              (beat)
                         Don't you ever feel used, Paula? 
                         Don't you ever feel like if this is 
                         all you get for your trouble then 
                         the sonofabitch ought to be paying 
                         for it...?

                                     PAULA
                         No. I never feel like that.

                                     LYNETTE
                         I do.

               INT. THE POKRIFKI KITCHEN - DAY

               As mother and daughter prepare the Sunday meal, Ester finds 
               herself studying her daughter almost as if she were seeing 
               herself as a girl, in Paula.

                                     ESTHER
                         You look real pretty, darling. I'm 
                         sure everything'll go just fine.

                                     PAULA
                         Mom, I don't want to be a fool. I 
                         like him a whole lot but...

                                     ESTHER
                         Honey, you can only be yourself. If 
                         that isn't enough for Zack...

               Both women move to the window as they hear his MOTORCYCLE 
               APPROACH. Zack motors up, and starts for the door, a bouquet 
               of flowers in his hand, his white liberty uniform almost 
               sparkling in the bright sunshine. Esther's eyes become soft, 
               almost limpid.

                                     ESTHER
                              (a young girl again)
                         He's very handsome.

               Paula looks at her for a moment, then leaves the kitchen.

               INT. THE POKRIFKI LIVING ROOM

               Joe Pokrifki is watching Zack from the living room window, 
               threatened to his core. The DOORBELL RINGS and Paula moves 
               past him to answer it. Seeing the expression on her father's 
               face, she stops.

                                     PAULA
                         Daddy, please be nice to him.

               Joe just stares at her. The DOORBELL RINGS AGAIN and she 
               opens the door.

               EXT. THE HOUSE - DAY

               Zack stands there with the flowers in his hand, smiling 
               eagerly.

                                     ZACK
                         Hi.

                                     PAULA
                         Are those for me?

                                     ZACK
                         No, they're for your mom.

               INT. POKRIFKI DINING ROOM - DAY

               The flowers he brought are in a vase on the table. Esther is 
               serving out helpings of stew. As she serves Zack, she meets 
               his eyes and smiles an almost flirtatious smile.

                                     ESTHER
                         Thanks again for the flowers, Zack.

                                     ZACK
                         My pleasure, Mrs. Pokrifki.

               Across the table from Zack, Joe is staring their way in a 
               most hostile manner.

                                     ESTHER
                         How many more weeks before you 
                         graduate, Zack?

                                     ZACK
                         Just three, ma'am.

               Again, a flirtatious look. Joe sees it. And so does Paula.

               To compound matters, Paula's little sisters are also flirting 
               with Zack, and Joe Pokrifki is taking it all as a threat to 
               his castle, an outright attack on his manhood.

               Finally, Zack can handle his stares no longer. He smiles his 
               most disarming smile and meets the man's gaze.

                                     ZACK
                         Sir, excuse me, but why're you looking 
                         at me like that?

                                     JOE
                         Looking at you?

                                     ESTHER
                         He doesn't mean anything by it, Zack. 
                         Do you, Joe?

                                     JOE
                         I don't mean anything by it.

                                     ZACK
                         Great dinner! Mrs. Pokrifki. 
                         Absolutely the best meal I've had in 
                         a long, long time.

               Esther is staring at him with faraway eyes, and her answer 
               comes as though on a time-delay.

                                     ESTHER
                              (beat)
                         Oh... yes... thank you, Zack.

               Embarrassed to the point of tears, Paula rises to her feet.

                                     PAULA
                         Come on, Zack. Let's go for a walk.

               Zack rises and follows her out.

               EXT. THE POKRIFKI HOUSE - DAY

               As they leave the house and start down the street, Paula 
               starts to cry and Zack puts his arm around her shoulders.

                                     PAULA
                         I'm so embarrassed. I knew I shouldn't 
                         have brought you here.

                                     ZACK
                         No, it's okay. It was a great free 
                         meal. Everybody was so uptight I 
                         felt sorry for you.

                                     PAULA
                         That's okay. I'm used to it.

               They walk in silence for awhile.

                                     PAULA
                         So, after you graduate you go on to 
                         basic flight, right? Is that in 
                         Pensacola?

                                     ZACK
                         Yeah, then if I get jets, it's on to 
                         Beeville, Texas.

               More silence. Paula words her next question very carefully.

                                     PAULA
                         Zack, do you ever think about what 
                         it'd be like to have kids... a family.

                                     ZACK
                              (lying)
                         No. Is that what you want?

                                     PAULA
                         Some day. When I'm sure I can do a 
                         better job of it than my folks.

                                     ZACK
                         What would you do differently?

                                     PAULA
                         For a start, I wouldn't marry a man 
                         I wasn't in love with.

                                     ZACK
                         Why'd your mom marry that guy if she 
                         didn't love him?

                                     PAULA
                         Because my real father wouldn't marry 
                         her.

                                     ZACK
                         Your real father?

               Paula takes her wallet out of the hip pocket of her jeans 
               and hands him a weathered old photo.

                                     PAULA
                         Yeah... him.

               INSERT - THE OLD PHOTO

               is of a handsome young flight candidate in uniform, with a 
               stylish little moustache and dark bedroom eyes.

               BACK TO SCENE

               Zack looks up from the photo, shaken.

                                     ZACK
                         Your real father was an Officer 
                         candidate like me?

                                     ZACK
                         No wonder he was looking at me like 
                         that.

               Paula watches him closely. Zack checks his wristwatch.

                                     ZACK
                         Uh-oh. Time to get back to the wars.

               He kisses her perhaps a little too quickly and starts toward 
               his parked motorcycle.

                                     PAULA
                         Call me during the week if you get 
                         the chance.

                                     ZACK
                         I'll try, but this week we go into 
                         survival training, so I can't make 
                         any promises.
                              (lamely)
                         Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank 
                         your mom again for me, will you?

                                     PAULA
                         Sure.
                              (beat)
                         Zack, I hope you know I didn't have 
                         to show you that picture.

                                     ZACK
                         I know that.

               With a smile that almost quells her concern, he drives off.

               Paula watches him until he disappears.

               EXT. TREE-LINED ROAD TO THE BASE - DAY

               SHOOTING THROUGH the passenger window, PAST Sid and Lynette 
               making out hot and heavy, TO Zack as he drives up on his 
               motorcycle.

                                     SID
                         See ya, sweetheart.

               He gets out and get on behind Zack.

               CAMERA MOVES WITH SID AND ZACK

               as they drive to the base.

                                     SID
                         I kid you not, Mayo, I am in love. 
                         We must've set a new indoor record 
                         today. You want to know how many 
                         times we did it?

                                     ZACK
                              (sharply)
                         You'd better get smart, man. It's 
                         time to walk away.

                                     SID
                         What? You've gotta be kidding!

                                     ZACK
                         Remember what Foley said? His little 
                         warning? Those are the girls he was 
                         talking about. They're out to marry 
                         us any way they can.

                                     SID
                         I don't believe that. They're just 
                         having a good time, same as us.

                                     ZACK
                         That's what they want you to think, 
                         but I saw where she lived, what is 
                         she's trying to get away from.
                              (urgently)
                         Just take my word for it, pard. Break 
                         it off now. Do it this week.

               EXT. THE SURVIVAL COURSE - DAY

               Zack, Sid, Casey, Perryman and Della-Serra are struggling to 
               erect a shelter in the driving downpour, using a parachute 
               and logs they've cut. It's a hokey little tepee at best but 
               they crowd inside it as THUNDER and lightning herald a blast 
               of monsoon-like rainfall. The shelter collapses on top of 
               them.

               INSIDE THE TENT - NIGHT (LATER)

               The five candidates are sitting around inside the tent, 
               listening to the rain, Zack slightly aloof and pensive.

                                     CASEY
                         I don't know about you guys but I'm 
                         starving.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A HELICOPTER SHOT OF ELGIN AIR FORCE BASE

               In the hinterlands beyond the Navy base is an Air Force base 
               with vast acreage of swamplands and tundra. A big truck comes 
               bouncing along a windy little road into the undergrowth. The 
               truck stops and the candidates from Zack's class file out 
               the back of it while Foley comes around from the passenger 
               seat to address them.

                                     FOLEY
                         Okay, worms. This is it. Can you 
                         pussies live through three days 
                         without food or water in the 
                         wilderness? This is where we thin 
                         our ranks the "natural" way, children. 
                         Incidentally, those little twigs you 
                         see floating in those mud puddles 
                         aren't twigs. They're water moccasins.

               GROUND LEVEL SHOTS

               reveal that he's right. Lethal-looking snakes slither and 
               glide over the surface of the swamp waters.

               THE FACES OF THE CANDIDATES

               reflect what you'd expect. Fear. Even Zack looks wary of the 
               ordeal ahead.

               MONTAGE OF SHOTS

               captures the humor of the next three days of survival 
               training. The candidates are a sorry spectacle the first day 
               and a half, trying to catch snakes with forked sticks, trying 
               to rub wood together to start a fire, throwing up from eating 
               the wrong berries, but generally clowning around, not taking 
               it too seriously. Then, as hunger sets in, a change comes 
               over them. They set up a big tent for shelter, get a nice 
               fire going, and prepare a serviceable meal from carefully 
               selected roots, berries and tree bark, and strips of fried 
               water moccasins. On the third day they plot a path through 
               the wilderness and finally emerge onto a highway where Foley 
               waits with the truck. The candidates send up a weary cheer 
               and embrace each other as if they'd just pulled off an escape 
               from a POW camp.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INSIDE THE SCOTT PAPER COMPANY

               Paula is on the line, sorting colors, while Lynette talks on 
               a payphone on the other side of the cavernous room. The noise 
               of the processors and conveyors is terrible, but her coworker, 
               Bunny, 38, a faded, jaded deb if there ever was one, calls 
               to her above the din:

                         You and Lynette still seeing those

                         I don't know... Friday... three forty 
                         in the afternoon and not a word out 
                         of you about where you're going, 
                         what you're doing over the weekend...

               Paula says nothing. She glances over at Lynette again, 
               hopefully. Bunny takes it all in, the consummate deb.

                                     BUNNY
                         Comes a time right after they get 
                         through survival training when they 
                         start to think they can make it 
                         without you. Suddenly they stop 
                         calling. Suddenly they own the goddamn 
                         world.
                              (beat)
                         He hasn't called you by now, Paula, 
                         he ain't gonna call.

                                     PAULA
                         You just keep your mouth shut, Bunny. 
                         You don't know so much!

                                     BUNNY
                         May they all crash and burn.

               INTERCUT LYNETTE AND SID

               He's at the barracks pay phone.

                                     LYNETTE
                         Sid Worley, I think you're ashamed 
                         of me.

                                     SID
                         Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. 
                         I mean that. After I leave them, 
                         I'll meet you at the motel, okay?

                                     LYNETTE
                         If you won't take me to dinner with 
                         your parents, I won't meet you at 
                         the motel.

                                     SID
                         Lynette, I told you already, it won't 
                         work.

                                     LYNETTE
                         Then, I'll see you around.

               She hangs up.

               THE FACES OF WOMEN WHO WORK AT THE OTHER CONVEYORS

               turn to watch Lynette as she returns to her place on the 
               tissue line. There's a saying that Mobile Debs never die, 
               they just go on working for Scott.

               The way some of the women watch her and shake their heads a 
               little, suggests that it might have some basis in truth.

               LYNETTE RESUMES HER PLACE ON THE LINE

               and struggles to come up with a perky grin, but then it sits 
               on her face like it belongs to someone else.

                                     LYNETTE
                         Well, so much for that.

               She has tears in her eyes.

                                     PAULA
                         Lynette, did he say anything about 
                         Zack?

               Lynette shakes her head, no.

                                     PAULA
                         Cover for me while I make a call.

               She moves off suddenly, toward the phone.

               AT THAT MOMENT, ZACK AND SID ARE LEAVING THE BARRACKS

               The Officer of the Deck comes out of the building a few 
               seconds later.

                                     O.O.D.
                         Hey, Mayo. There's someone named 
                         Paula on the phone.

                                     ZACK
                              (beat)
                         Tell her I already split.

               PAULA PUTS DOWN THE PHONE

               and returns to the line. All the old debs watch her.

               INT. THE HOLIDAY INN DINING ROOM - DAY

               STARTING ON Zack, eating at Mach Five. THEN INCLUDE Sid and 
               his parents, TOM and BETTY WORLEY, two of the world's 
               straightest human beings, stiffly WASPish in spite of their 
               down-home Oklahoma drawls, people with so much moral fiber 
               it shines humorless through everything they say or do.

                                     SID
                         Zack's only a tenth of a second off 
                         the all-time obstacle course record. 
                         He's bound to break it soon.

                                     BETTY
                         That's wonderful, Zack.

                                     ZACK
                         Your son is the one reason I'm still 
                         in the program, Mrs. Worley. He's 
                         pulled me through every exam.

                                     TOM
                         You guys are lucky you didn't go 
                         through the program when I did. They 
                         used to start that Dilbert Dunker 
                         twice as high as they do now.

                                     ZACK
                              (mouth full of food)
                         That's really interesting, sir.

                                     TOM
                         And you couldn't just quit like you 
                         can now. When I went through it... 
                         and when my oldest boy went through 
                         it... if you bilged out you were 
                         sent into the fleet as a swabby.
                              (suddenly)
                         Sid, how come you haven't written 
                         Susan in over three weeks?

               Sid looks stricken. He glances at Zack, sees his quizzical 
               expression, and looks away.

                                     SID
                         We haven't had time to write anybody.

                                     BETTY
                         Zack, is my son involved with a local 
                         girl?

                                     ZACK
                         No, ma'am. All he ever talks about 
                         is, us, Susan.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE WATERFRONT - NIGHT

               CAMERA MOVES with Sid and Zack as they make their way toward 
               the LOUD ROCK MUSIC coming out of the legendary "TRADER 
               JON'S."

                                     SID
                         Thanks for covering for me.

                                     ZACK
                         No problem, but who's Susan?

                                     SID
                         My girl back home. We're supposed to 
                         get married after I get my wings. 
                         She was Tommy's girl. They were 
                         engaged to be married before he died.
                              (beat)
                         I should've told you about her. I 
                         don't know why I didn't, except I 
                         didn't want you to think I was a 
                         shit for making it with Lynette.

                                     ZACK
                         I'm not your folks, man. You love 
                         this... Susan?

                                     SID
                         She's the sweetest person I've ever 
                         known. Loves kids. Works with 
                         handicapped kids every afternoon at 
                         the church. Everybody loves her.

                                     ZACK
                         I didn't ask you all that, Sweet 
                         Pea. I asked if you loved her.

                                     SID
                              (distracted)
                         Listen, I'm not going to go to that 
                         little reunion party. I'm meeting 
                         Lynette at the motel.
                              (a sheepish grin)
                         Best head in fifty-two states. After 
                         three days of survival training, how 
                         could I resist?

               Zack rubs his buddy's bristle-brush of hair, affectionately.

                                     ZACK
                         You should've done what I did. A 
                         clean break.

                                     SID
                         Lynette told me it really tore her 
                         up when you didn't call this week.

               For an instant, Zack's mind seems to be on Paula, but he 
               pushes her out fast.

                                     ZACK
                         There's women for you, pard. They 
                         tell you they're in it for the laughs, 
                         but it's always a fucking lie.
                              (a loud whoop)
                         Look out, Trader Jon's, I'm in the 
                         mood for some fun!

               He mock salutes Sid and disappears into T.J.'s.

               INT. TRADER JON'S - NIGHT

               STARTING ON THE PHOTOS of The Blue Angels that crowd the 
               walls... a lithe, young stripper DANCES INTO FRAME. Hanging 
               from a net overhead are countless model airplanes.

               Seeger, Della-Serra, Perryman and Zack are at the bar, drinks 
               raised in toast.

                                     ZACK
                         Hey, guys -- we did it. We survived!

               They clink glasses. As the others sip their beers, Zack downs 
               a double shot of tequila and pushes his glass toward the 
               grizzly-looking bartender, old TRADER JON himself.

                                     ZACK
                         Give me another double Tequila.

               His shipmates share a look. Seeger's attention then shifts 
               to the dancer. What a body she has. Perfect little coffee 
               cup breasts. A bottom that tightens and relaxes like a fist 
               as she dances to the loud, rock music.

                                     CASEY
                              (watching the dancer)
                         Not bad.

                                     DELLA-SERRA
                         So women turn you on, huh, Seeger? I 
                         always thought you were a dyke.

                                     CASEY
                         Cool it, Emiliano. I don't find it 
                         funny.

               CAMERA MOVES with the dancer, away from the group and we:

                                                               TIME CUT TO:

               SHORT TIME LATER

               Zack is hoisting a chair with shells onto the bar top.

                                     ZACK
                              (smashed)
                         Lemme show you little game called 
                         "Crash and Burn".

               He climbs up on the bar and sits down in the chair. The 
               Olongapo Kid.

                                     ZACK
                         Listen up, dick-brains! This is how 
                         we separate the jet jockeys from the 
                         helo-boys. Guy who flies the farthest 
                         without crashing and burning... he's 
                         hot shit!

               Seeger, Perryman and Della-Serra glance nervously around the 
               place. Nobody thinks it's that funny, especially Trader Jon.

                                     DELLA-SERRA
                         Come on, Mayo! You're gonna get our 
                         asses in trouble, man!

                                     PERRYMAN
                         Get down from there, before they 
                         call the shore patrol.

                                     ZACK
                         Come on! Give me a push! Never hochi 
                         in the P.I. you see jet-jockey so 
                         hot like me!

                                     TRADER JON
                         Hey, buddy, cool it.

               Seeger approaches Zack.

                                     CASEY
                         Zack, we've got to go.

                                     ZACK
                         Just trying to have fun. That fucking 
                         prison is really starting to get to 
                         me. C'mon, Seeger. Gimme a push.
                              (beat)
                         Fuck you guys! I'll do it myself!

               He pushes off with his feet and the chair glides down the 
               bar, knocking over glasses and beer bottles. The chair and 
               its rider topple over the bar and Zack goes sprawling onto a 
               table, laughing like a looney.

                                     TRADER JON
                         Okay, that's it!

               Seeger quickly turns to her cohorts.

                                     CASEY
                         You guys take care of Trader Jon 
                         while I get him out of here.

               Perryman and Della-Serra nod and head off to deal with the 
               man while she goes to Zack.

                                     CASEY
                         C'mon, Zack. We've got to get out of 
                         here!

               He allows her to lead him toward the exit.

               EXT. TRADER JON'S - NIGHT

               Casey pushes him into the backseat of a taxi, but Zack grabs 
               her by the hand and tries to pull her inside.

                                     ZACK
                         C'mon, Seeger. Let's go to the Tides 
                         Inn Motel.

               He pulls her close and kisses her on the lips, but she gently 
               pulls away.

                                     CASEY
                         You're cute, Mayo, but you don't 
                         want me. And to tell you the truth, 
                         I don't want you.
                              (a quick kiss)
                         See you back at the base.

               She gives the driver a fiver and the taxi drives off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SID AND LYNETTE'S ROOM AT THE TIDES INN - NIGHT

               Sid lies in bed, staring up at the ceiling. WIDEN to include 
               Lynette, just starting to get dressed beside the bed.

                                     SID
                         By the way, shouldn't you have had a 
                         period by now?

                                     LYNETTE
                         I'm a little late, that's all.

                                     SID
                         How late?

                                     LYNETTE
                         What difference does it make? If 
                         anything was to happen, which I'm 
                         sure it isn't, it would be my 
                         responsibility.

                                     SID
                         Exactly how late are you, Lynette?

                                     LYNETTE
                              (playing him)
                         What do you care? Suppose I was 
                         pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't 
                         think I'd try to make you do anything 
                         you don't want to, do you?

                                     SID
                         No. But that's not the only issue 
                         here, sweetheart. There's a lot more 
                         to it than that.

               She's like an expert fisherman, working her catch, easing it 
               in so deftly it never feels the hook.

                                     LYNETTE
                         What other issue is there, Sid?

                                     SID
                         My responsibility as its father, for 
                         one. I mean, if I've made you 
                         pregnant, I'd want to... do the right 
                         thing.

               Lynette waits hopefully.

                                     SID
                         ...I'd want to pay for the abortion... 
                         I'd want to be with you through the 
                         whole thing... by your side.
                              (beat)
                         So how late are you, Lynette?

                                     LYNETTE
                              (cold)
                         Let's just wait and see what happens.

               She finishes dressing and leaves.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE BARRACKS SHOWER - NIGHT

               Zack sits in the shower, the water blasting down on his head.

               Sid bursts in.

                                     SID
                         Zack? God, I'm glad I found you. I 
                         need to talk to you, buddy.

               Zack is a zombie. He groans and gestures Sid off.

                                     ZACK
                         Talk to me in the morning. I feel 
                         like shit.

                                     SID
                         But it can't wait.

               He presses close to the shower, so preoccupied he doesn't 
               even notice the water spattering his uniform.

                                     SID
                         Guess fucking what! Lynette's missed 
                         her period. What am I gonna do, Zack? 
                         What can I tell my folks?

               What on God's green earth do I say to Susan.

                                     ZACK
                         Calm down, Sweet Pea. She seen a 
                         doctor?

                                     SID
                         No, but she's gotta be at least a 
                         month late.

                                     ZACK
                         Doesn't mean shit. Get her to a 
                         doctor. You can't do anything until 
                         you hear what he says. Make the 
                         appointment yourself.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE LEARNING CENTER - DAY

               The class is taking a critical multiple choice exam. Zack 
               struggles against his basic instinct to cheat off of Casey's 
               paper. He's still slower than most of the others but he's 
               doing okay. It's Sid who's slipping under. His mind is so 
               far away he hasn't even bothered to write his name at the 
               top of the exam paper.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE BARRACKS - LATER THAT DAY

               The class, down to a scrappy 23 survivors, comes running in 
               after the exam, Foley right on their heels.

                                     FOLEY
                         Fall out on the lawn in five minutes! 
                         This is your last shot at the 101 
                         Course... Mayo... Seeger... Della-
                         Serra...

               As the rest of the class goes bounding up the stairwell. Sid 
               rushes up to the O.O.D.

                                     SID
                         Sir, request permission to make an 
                         emergency phone call, sir!

               The O.O.D. nods and Sid starts feeding quarter into the 
               payphone on the wall. Zack hangs back, concerned.

                                     FOLEY
                         Move it, Mayo!

               Zack glares at Foley and runs up the stairs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE OBSTACLE COURSE - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

               STARTING TIGHT on Seeger's face as Foley starts her.

                                     FOLEY
                         Go!

               He starts several of the others AD LIB. Then it's Zack's 
               turn.

                                     FOLEY
                         Go!

               Zack takes off across the course with a gleam in his eye. He 
               wants that record. Zack dances through the innertubes, hand 
               over hands the parallel bars, and churns his way through a 
               stretch of knee-deep sand, his classmates cheering him on, 
               wanting the record, too, wanting to leave their mark.

               They all wear warmups similar to the ones worn by the crack 
               squad they saw in the early days of training, except that 
               their shirts are gold and their pants are blue.

               On the front of their shirts is an insignia and the words:

               "FOLEY'S FIRE EATERS." Their nicknames have been printed 
               boldly on the back: "MAYONNAISE," "B. SANDWICH," "THE MARRIED 
               MAN," "THE WILD WOP," (DELLA-SERRA), "GODZILLA." "WHAT ME 
               WORRY?," ETC. Across the back of Foley's all red warmup suit 
               are these words: "YOU'RE PISSING ME OFF, BOY!"

               As Zack passes his slower classmates, they add their shouts 
               of encouragement to the cheering from the sidelines. "Do it, 
               Mayo!" "Put our name up there, Mayonnaise!" "You can do it!"

               Zack shimmies up a rope, yanks his body over the low hurdles, 
               crawls on his back under the low horizontal bars, scampers 
               up the angled beam, leaps the moat... and is approaching the 
               wall full tilt when he sees Seeger up ahead, struggling as 
               usual to get over it.

                                     ZACK
                              (calling)
                         Come on, Seeger! Let's go over it 
                         together!

               He makes it in one leap but she falls back to the ground, 
               beaten. Zack pauses at the top of the wall and looks down at 
               her.

               Foley watches from the distance.

               Zack drops back down beside Seeger. She has tears of 
               frustration in her eyes.

               She's not going to make it and the realization that she's 
               come this far only to fail is crushing her.

                                     CASEY
                         Go on, Zack! Go for the record!

                                     ZACK
                         Fuck the record. Now you listen to 
                         me and do exactly what I tell you.
                              (he draws a line with 
                              his foot)
                         Start back ten yards and take off 
                         from here. Not here... or there... 
                         but right here!
                              (the total officer)
                         No excuses, Seeger! You are going to 
                         plant those legs here and then you're 
                         going to yank yourself over that 
                         wall because you have to! You want 
                         jets? Then do it, goddamnit!

               Seeger nods, almost mesmerized by his decisive tone of voice, 
               his sudden emergence as a leader. She starts running, takes 
               off exactly on the mark, and struggles to the top of the 
               wall.

               She drops down on the other side and Zack joins her, smiling

               FOLEY STOPS HIS WATCH

               and shakes his head. He can live without that record.

               ZACK AND CASEY

               As they finish the course, they stop and hug each other. 
               Then something catches Zack's eye that chases the good 
               feelings away.

               ZACK'S POV

               Big Sid is trudging slowly toward the 101 Course in his 
               warmup, his nickname: "LOVERBOY" somehow ironic, especially 
               in this moment. Sid sees Zack looking his way and signals 
               the news to him by putting his arms into a baby-cradling 
               position and rocking the imaginary off-spring from side to 
               side.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INSIDE THE MESS HALL - DAY

               Zack and Sid are in line, getting their food.

                                     SID
                         It's a big religious thing with her 
                         and she won't even discuss it.

                                     ZACK
                         But she expects you to marry her?

                                     SID
                         She said it was up to me. If I don't, 
                         she'll go off and have the baby on 
                         her own somewhere.

               At the mention of the word "baby" nearby classmates perk 
               their ears up.

                                     ZACK
                         So what's the problem? Girls do that 
                         all the time.

                                     SID
                         I can't let her go off and have the 
                         kid by herself and not do anything. 
                         If it's my kid, too, then I've got a 
                         responsibility, don't I?

                                     ZACK
                         Not if she won't even talk about an 
                         abortion.

                                     SID
                         But it would still be my kid. That's 
                         the point.

                                     ZACK
                         Do you know that for sure?

                                     SID
                         It's mine.

               They leave the food line and start toward the tables.

                                     ZACK
                         Okay, but what if it's like Foley 
                         said and she got knocked up, to trap 
                         you -- is it still your 
                         responsibility?

                                     SID
                         No matter how it happened, if she 
                         goes ahead and has it" Zack, there'll 
                         be a child in the world that's mine --
                         and I couldn't go through life knowing 
                         that and not knowing its name or 
                         where it lived.

                                     ZACK
                         Jesus Christ, Sid! Is everything 
                         your responsibility?

               ANGLE A TABLE

               Sid and Zack sit down with their classmates and start eating.

                                     ZACK
                         Your brother getting killed instead 
                         of you... Isn't that why you promised 
                         to marry this Susan? Isn't that why 
                         you do everything, man? Out of some 
                         bullshit code of ethics you inherited 
                         from your family?

               Foley can be seen at the Instructors' table, IN SHOT

               BACKGROUND, watching them, but Sid and Zack are oblivious to 
               their audience.

                                     SID
                              (angrily)
                         Maybe it's all bullshit to you, but 
                         that's now how I was raised. I believe 
                         we have a responsibility to the people 
                         in our lives -- that that's the only 
                         thing that separates us from the 
                         goddamn animals!
                              (beat)
                         I'm not like you, Mayo. I can't just 
                         shit on people and then sleep like a 
                         baby all night!

               The words sting and Zack flares back at his friend.

                                     ZACK
                         You got a responsibility to you first, 
                         pard -- and if you can't handle that, 
                         you've got bigger problems than 
                         getting a girl pregnant!

               They stare at each other a long time, but no more words come.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. THE ALTITUDE CHAMBER - DAY

               Wearing full oxygen masks, Zack and Sid are part of a group 
               of six candidates playing pat-a-cake at simulated altitudes 
               inside the claustrophobic-small decompression chamber. An 
               INSTRUCTOR is explaining the test over an intercom, from 
               outside the windowed chamber.

                                     INSTRUCTOR
                         Now everybody take off your masks 
                         but continue the same exercise. The 
                         purpose is to show you the effects 
                         of altitude on the motor skills when 
                         you've been cut off from your oxygen.

               Slowly their reactions begin to deteriorate. At first Sid 
               seems amused by his and Zack's fumbling to slap hands. Then 
               as a SHINING SOUND mounts into a crazy place, he begins to 
               panic.

                                     SID
                              (suddenly, calling)
                         Stop this thing! I said stop it!

               Everyone looks at him strangely. Sid lurches like a drunk to 
               his feet and tries to move toward the door. He trips over 
               himself and falls, then stays there with his hands on his 
               ears and his body curled into a fetal position.

                                     SID
                         I want out! Let me out! Please! Let 
                         me out!

               Zack extricates himself from his harness like a man with 
               eight thumbs condemned on top of it to move in slow motion. 
               He weaves, drops to his knees by Sid, and awkwardly tries to 
               enclose him in his arms.

                                     ZACK
                         Sid, it's okay. Don't be afraid.

               The WHINING STOPS as they start to back off on the pressure 
               inside the chamber, but they can't do it too fast. Slowly 
               Sid comes to his senses, and his eyes focus on Zack.

                                     ZACK
                         Sid, what happened?

                                     SID
                         I don't know... I felt like... like 
                         I was suffocating... Christ, Zack... 
                         I was so scared... so godddamn 
                         scared...

               Tears are running down Sid's face.

                                     ZACK
                         Hey, man, don't cry... not in front 
                         of the instructors.

               Zack looks around at the faces, all staring back in judgement, 
               not just the instructors. By now, the candidates know the 
               symptoms of a DOR as well as anybody.

               The door to the chamber slams open and Foley is standing 
               there, grim-faced.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE PARADE GROUND - DAY

               Zack is on morning "colors" duty. He and one of the lesser-
               known candidates are raising the flag, a bugler standing 
               nearby, blowing "morning colors". Zack suddenly sees something 
               that chills him.

               Sid and Foley stand in front of the Admin. Building, Foley 
               saluting the flag, Sid just standing there arms at his sides, 
               shoulders slumped.

               As the bugler finishes, Zack turns to his classmate.

                                     ZACK
                         I gotta do something.

               He breaks into a run.

               TRACK WITH ZACK

               as he runs toward Foley and Sid and walks with them toward 
               the water.

                                     ZACK
                              (to Foley)
                         You didn't kick him out...? Wait, 
                         didn't he tell you what he's been 
                         going through?

                                     FOLEY
                         It doesn't matter what he's going 
                         through. That's the whole purpose of 
                         this zoo. What matters is he freaked 
                         out for some reason at twenty-five 
                         thousand feet and that can't ever 
                         happen again.

                                     ZACK
                         But you don't understand. There's 
                         this girl he's gotten pregnant and 
                         she's putting him through hell, sir.

                                     SID
                         He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter.

                                     ZACK
                         Just like that it's all over? With 
                         less than two weeks to go, you're 
                         out?

                                     FOLEY
                         It can still happen to you, too, 
                         Mayo.

               Foley marches off like a windup toy.

                                     ZACK
                              (furious)
                         Come back here, motherfucker!

               Foley spins around, his eyes sparkling wildly.

                                     FOLEY
                         What did you call me, Mayo?

                                     SID
                         Zack, don't!

                                     ZACK
                         I thought the D.I.'s were supposed 
                         to help you in this place! What kind 
                         of human being are you?

                                     FOLEY
                         Stop eyeballing me, Mayo, or you're 
                         out!

                                     SID
                         Please, Zack -- go back to the 
                         barracks!

                                     ZACK
                         I don't get it! He's the best 
                         candidate in our class! Ask anyone! 
                         The best student! The best leader! 
                         The best friend to everybody! Couldn't 
                         you bend your goddamn standards just 
                         a little?

                                     SID
                         Zack, it wasn't him! He didn't ask 
                         me to D.O.R. I came to him on my 
                         own.
                              (beat)
                         I'm glad it's over, Zack. I really 
                         mean that. He was right. I wasn't 
                         doing this for me.

               He feels his tears coming up so he runs off suddenly across 
               the parade ground.

                                     ZACK
                         Sid, wait! Where're you going?

               Sid keeps running. Zack turns back to Foley and they stare 
               at each other a long moment before Zack bitterly salutes 
               him.

                                     ZACK
                         With your permission, sir.

               Foley returns the salute and watches Zack walk off toward 
               the barracks.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. PAULA'S HOUSE - DAY

               Zack drives up on his motorcycle. Esther is in the yard, 
               gardening.

                                     ZACK
                         Is Paula here?

               Paula suddenly appears on the porch, dressed in a simple 
               cotton dress, her hair un-coiffed, none of her Deb makeup.

                                     ZACK
                         I'm looking for Sid.

                                     PAULA
                         So?

                                     ZACK
                         Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen 
                         him.

                                     PAULA
                         Why'd he do it?

                                     ZACK
                         Hey! You know goddamn well what 
                         happened so let's not play any games, 
                         okay?

                                     PAULA
                         I'm not playing any games! Go look 
                         at Lynette's!

                                     ZACK
                         I don't know where that is.

               Paula slowly moves to him and gets on the motorcycle behind 
               him. They speed off, Esther watching them go.

               EXT. LYNETTE'S HOUSE - DAY

               She sits on the porch of the old home she was born in, her 
               hair up in curlers, doing her nails. The National Paper mill 
               sends up pillars of smoke on the horizon. A taxi drives up 
               and Sid steps out, in a sport coat and tie.

                                     SID
                         Hi, babe. Come on. I've got a couple 
                         of things I want to tell you.

                                     LYNETTE
                         What're you doing out of uniform, 
                         Sid? You don't want to get in trouble.

                                     SID
                         Forget that. Come on. Got a little 
                         surprise...

                                     LYNETTE
                         I can't go like this. Can't you wait 
                         a few minutes 'til I'm ready?

                                     SID
                         No way. I'm so happy I'm about to 
                         bust. Here, honey. This is for you. 
                         It cost me my whole savings, but I 
                         said what the fuck.

               He hands her a little box. She opens it and finds an 
               engagement ring. She looks up at him, happily.

                                     LYNETTE
                         Sid! Oh, it's beautiful! You mean...

                                     SID
                         That's right. Let's get married, 
                         Lynette. Let's find a justice of the 
                         peace and just do it!

               Lynette tries the ring on.

                                     LYNETTE
                              (euphoric)
                         Let's go tell Paula! God, I wonder 
                         where we'll be stationed first. I 
                         hope it'll be Hawaii. I've always 
                         wanted to go to Hawaii.

                                     SID
                         We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, 
                         baby. I DORed.

                                     LYNETTE
                              (shaken)
                         You what?

                                     SID
                         I had to, baby... I'm no aviator. I 
                         was faking it, like I was with 
                         everything else in my life... up 
                         'til right now.

                                     LYNETTE
                         But... but what would we do? Where 
                         would we go?

                                     SID
                         Oklahoma. I can get my old job back 
                         at JC Penney's. In a couple of years, 
                         I'll be floor manager. Oh, you're 
                         gonna love Oklahoma, Lynette. You 
                         and mama'll get along just great. Of 
                         course, money will be a little tight 
                         for a while, but we'll make it.

                                     LYNETTE
                              (suddenly)
                         Sid, there's no baby.

                                     SID
                         What?

                                     LYNETTE
                         I'm not pregnant. I got my period 
                         this morning. There's no baby, Sid.

                                     SID
                         Well, I'll be goddamned.

               Sid stares at her disbelievingly, but she's telling the truth, 
               at least partly. There is no baby.

                                     SID
                              (a big smile)
                         What do you say we get married anyway? 
                         I love you, Lynette. I'm in love 
                         with you... and I didn't realize it 
                         until right this second... but I've 
                         never been happier in my life than I 
                         have been the last seven weekends, 
                         never more relaxed... more loved for 
                         just who I am...
                              (beat)
                         Marry me, Lynette. I love you.

               Lynette looks off at the factory, then back at Sid.

                                     LYNETTE
                         I'm sorry, Sid, but I don't want to 
                         marry you. I like you a lot and we 
                         had ourselves some real nice times, 
                         that's for sure... but I thought you 
                         understood. I want to marry a pilot, 
                         Sid. I want to live part of my life 
                         overseas... the wife of an aviator, 
                         Sid.
                              (bitterly)
                         Damn you! Goddamn you! Nobody DORs 
                         after eleven weeks! Nobody!

               She throws the engagement ring at him and runs toward the 
               house. Numb to his core, Sid slowly retrieves the ring and 
               gets into her car. He starts it and drives off.

                                     LYNETTE
                         Hey! Come back with my car!

               EXT. A DIRT ROAD - DAY

               Lynette's Falcon takes a sudden turn. A split-second later, 
               Zack and Paula speed past in the opposite direction, missing 
               him.

               EXT. LYNETTE'S HOUSE - DAY

               Zack and Paula drive up and move toward the front door.

                                     PAULA
                         Lynette??

               INT. LYNETTE'S HOUSE - DAY

               They find her in the kitchen, sitting at the table, smoking 
               a cigarette.

                                     PAULA
                         Lynette, where's Sid?

                                     LYNETTE
                         Already come and gone. Can you believe 
                         it? He DORed in the twelfth week. 
                         How can you win?

               Zack grabs her by the shoulders and forces her to meet his 
               eyes.

                                     ZACK
                         What did you tell him about the baby?

                                     LYNETTE
                         That there isn't one, as of today. I 
                         had my period.
                              (beat)
                         I couldn't believe it. He still wanted 
                         to marry me.

                                     ZACK
                         And you turned him down??

                                     LYNETTE
                         Of course. I don't want no Okie from 
                         Muscogee. I can get that right here 
                         in Port Angeles.

               Zack starts shaking her angrily.

                                     ZACK
                         You little bitch! How could you? Was 
                         there ever a baby, Lynette? That's 
                         all I want to know! Did you make up 
                         that baby, Lynette? Did you??

                                     LYNETTE
                              (caught)
                         Of course there was a baby. I'd never 
                         lie about something like that. Would 
                         I, Paula?

               She looks at Paula for support but she seems to be wondering 
               the same things herself, and offers none. Zack abruptly pushes 
               out of the room, leaving the two girls alone.

                                     PAULA
                         Lynette, did you make up that baby 
                         or didn't you?

               Lynette's silence is answer enough. Paula suddenly slaps her 
               across the face with all her might.

                                     PAULA
                         God help you, Lynette!

                                     LYNETTE
                         You're no better than me, Paula! 
                         You're just the same!

                                     PAULA
                         No! That's not true!

               She runs from the room.

               EXT. LYNETTE'S HOUSE - DAY

               Zack is getting on his motorcycle as she emerges from the 
               house.

                                     PAULA
                         I'd like to come with you.

                                     ZACK
                         Why?

                                     PAULA
                         Because he's my friend, too.

               She gets on and he doesn't try to stop her. PAN as they drive 
               off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT./EXT. THE TIDES INN - DAY

               Carrying a pint bottle of bourbon, Sid weaves his way into 
               the office. He smiles a quirky smile for the WOMAN behind 
               the counter as he hands her some money and she gives him his 
               key.

               As he turns away from the counter, the woman calls after 
               him.

                                     WOMAN
                         Hey, is this yours?

               She holds up the engagement ring he bought for Lynette. Sid 
               smiles, takes it from her.

                                     SID
                         Ever seen this one?

               He pops the ring in his mouth and swallows it as the woman 
               looks on, speechless. Sid weaves out.

               WE'RE TIGHT ON SID'S FACE

               as he trudges up the steps to the second floor of units. We 
               stay with him until he reaches his room and walks in, slamming 
               the door behind him to close the world out.

               WE STAY LIKE THAT, OUTSIDE HIS DOOR

               The SOUND of the TV going on, loud. Some game show. The 
               passage of about twenty seconds. Then the SOUND of Zack's 
               MOTORCYCLE approaching, stopping.

                                     ZACK (O.S.)
                         He's here. She said he just came in.

               The SOUND of FOOTSTEPS ascending to the second floor, running 
               toward us. Zack PUSHES INTO SHOT and knocks on the door.

                                     ZACK
                         Sid, it's Zack. Open up.

               No reply, then from inside some SOUNDS are heard, a CHAIR 
               FALLING, a sudden, dull SNAPPING NOISE, abrupt and final.

               Zack throw his weight against the door and it splinters open.

                                     ZACK
                         Sid?

               Then he looks up and pales.

                                     ZACK
                         Oh, God...

               Paula steps into the doorway and utters a little gasp as she 
               sees what poor Sid had done to himself.

               INT. THE ROOM - DAY

               The big Okie hangs by his necktie from a cluster of exposed 
               drainage pipes in a corner of the ceiling.

               ZACK'S FACE IS STRETCHED WITH PAIN

               Tears flood his eyes. He shakes his head in disbelief.

                                     ZACK
                         Oh, God... why? Why, Sid?

               Zack cuts him down and cradles his friend's body in his arms.

                                     ZACK
                         You stupid, fucking Okie! Why'd you 
                         do it! Why didn't you talk to me 
                         first? Why didn't you even try??

               Paula watches from the door.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. THE TIDES INN - LATER THAT DAY

               The last of the police cars and the one Shore Patrol sedan 
               from the base are pulling out of the Tides Inn lot, behind 
               the ambulance that carries Sid's body. Paula stands on the 
               upstairs landing.

                                     PAULA
                         Please stop it. None of that's true. 
                         Goddamnit, I love you. I loved you 
                         ever since I met you.

                                     ZACK
                         Come on, Paula! You were looking for 
                         a ticket out of here and you didn't 
                         care who it was, any more than you 
                         cared with the last class of 
                         candidates you and Lynette fucked 
                         your way through, looking for a 
                         husband! Or the class before that!

                                     PAULA
                         Yeah. You got the whole story just 
                         right.

                                     ZACK
                         Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we 
                         all laughed, especially him.

                                     PAULA
                         I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that 
                         goddamn term!

                                     ZACK
                         I bet you do!

                                     PAULA
                         However you got it figured, I didn't 
                         kill Sid and Lynette didn't kill 
                         him! He killed himself!

                                     ZACK
                         That's brilliant.

                                     PAULA
                         Maybe not, but it is the truth. And 
                         Zack, you didn't kill him either.

               He goes out the door. Paula can see him drive off on his 
               motorcycle.

               EXT. THE BARRACKS - LATER THAT DAY

                         Mayo.

               He takes notice of Zack's absence, unsurprised, before pushing 
               on the next name on the list.

                                     FOLEY
                         Meyers.

               Zack suddenly drives up on his motorcycle and walks toward 
               the group, unshaven, tie askew, uniform totally wrinkled, 
               eyes as red as sores.

                                     FOLEY
                         Mayo, the rest of your class knows 
                         about candidate Worley, and we're 
                         all sorry.

                                     ZACK
                         Sir, this officer candidate requests 
                         permission to speak to you in private.

                                     FOLEY
                         I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.

                                     ZACK
                         It's important, sir!

                                     FOLEY
                         Mayo, you didn't hear me -- I said I 
                         I'm busy! And so are you! Go get 
                         cleaned up!

                                     ZACK
                         Aw screw it...

               He starts to walk into the barracks.

                                     FOLEY
                              (suddenly)
                         Martial arts demonstration in the 
                         old blimp hangar in five minutes! 
                         Mayo, you're my volunteer!

               Zack stops in his tracks and turns to face his antagonist.

               He'll wait around for this.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE MUSTY OLD HANGAR - DAY

               Foley is up in the ring in his VC pajamas, watching them 
               take do their seats. Zack is the last to walk in.

                                     FOLEY
                         What're you waiting for, Mayo? Get 
                         your scuzzy ass up here.

                                     ZACK
                         Yes, sir!

               He climbs up into the ring with Foley.

                                     FOLEY
                         Put these on.

               He hands Zack a set of safety-punch gloves and safety-kick 
               foot pads. Zack sits on the canvas and puts them on. Foley 
               already wears his.

                                     FOLEY
                         I'll start with some basic kicks. 
                         You try to copy me.

               Zack gets to his feet and squares off opposite Foley.

               MOST OF ZACK'S CLASSMATES

               know about the incident in town with the locals, and the 
               word spreads quickly to the others in excited whispers. They 
               share a common dream, these twenty-one survivors, to see 
               Foley broken and humbled.

               THE MARTIAL ARTS DEMONSTRATION - A SERIES OF SHOTS

               Foley demonstrates a simple side kick, the heel of his foot 
               slamming hard against Zack's jaw. As in the previous 
               demonstration, Foley isn't afraid of inflecting a little 
               punishment along with his instruction. He's unprepared, 
               however, for the skill and and speed with which Zack returns 
               a version of that kick, the heel of his foot hitting Foley 
               so solidly it rocks him back a couple of steps before he can 
               catch his balance.

               Foley grins, a rivulet of blood running down his chin.

                                     FOLEY
                         Looky-looky what we got. That's pretty 
                         cute, Mayo.

               Foley executes a crescent kick, his specialty, and bloodies 
               Zack's mouth. Zack returns a crescent kick that knocks the 
               Marine right on his ass.

                                     FOLEY
                         You're good.

                                     ZACK
                         Get on your feet and find out how 
                         good, sir.

               Before Zack can get set, Foley seizes the offensive and starts 
               backing him across the ring with a series of fast kicks.

               Momentarily trapped in the corner, Zack ducks a punch, slips 
               under a crescent kick, and hits his man three times in the 
               face with his foam-padded knuckles, then follows with a kick 
               to the mid-section that makes the Marine sink to his knees 
               with a silly expression on his face.

               Suddenly unafraid of Foley, the class rises to its feet and 
               cheers Zack on.

               Ad-LIBS of "Get him, Zack!" "No mercy!" "Remember what he 
               did to us!" Quieter mumblings of "Kill the motherfucker."

               Foley gets to his feet. Zack drops him instantly with a 
               jumpspinning back kick.

               Foley gets up again and manages to stay up for a short time 
               but it's a pathetic mismatch and Zack can land solidly at 
               will with hands and feet. Finally, with a spinning outside 
               crescent kick that awes his classmates, Zack flattens him 
               again. Foley just lies there, obviously spent.

               Zack offers him a hand. Foley looks up at him helplessly, 
               shakes his head in defeat, and reaches out to accept his 
               help.

               Then, with shocking suddenness, Foley coils his knees to his 
               chest, yanks Zack toward him, and -- at the same time -- 
               unleashes a kick straight to Zack's chin. Zack crumples to 
               the canvas and lies there, barely conscious. Foley rises to 
               his feet.

                                     FOLEY
                         Oldest trick in the book. Now, is 
                         there anything you want to tell me, 
                         Mayo?

               Zack shakes his head, no. Foley bows to him formally, then 
               to the rest of the class, and marches like God's Warrior Son 
               from the old hangar.

               Zack watches his classmates file out, leaving him alone in 
               the cavernous hanger.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. THE BARRACKS - NIGHT

               Zack comes in by himself.

               INT. ZACK'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Perryman looks up from his Navigation book as his only 
               surviving roommate enters. Zack looks at the two stripped 
               bunks, the empty lockers... then he stares at his own locker 
               for a long time, trying to make up his mind.

               Then Perryman gets up, puts a reassuring hand on his shoulder, 
               just for an instant, and goes back to his studies. Finding 
               some coins in his locker, Zack leaves the room.

               INT. THE BARRACKS PAYPHONE - NIGHT

               Zack throws some money in to satisfy the operator.

                                     ZACK
                              (into phone)
                         Byron, it's me. You doing anything 
                         weekend after next?
                              (beat)
                         Yeah... it's graduation.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               GRADUATION MORNING ON THE BASE - DAY

               The sun is just rising and sending its colors across the 
               big, wide lawn where the graduation ceremony will soon take 
               place.

               Four enlisted men are positioning risers and folding chairs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PAULA'S BEDROOM - DAY

               Paula gets up to the SOUND of her alarm. She hurries to turn 
               it off so as not to awaken her sisters. The time is 6:30 in 
               the morning. Time to go to work. Grudgingly, she relinquishes 
               the warmth of the bed, and trudges toward the bathroom in 
               her pajamas.

               EXT. PAULA'S HOUSE - DAY

               Paula gets into Bunny's Toyota and the carpool drives on.

               EXT. THE NATIONAL PAPER MILL - DAY

               As Paula is punching in, Lynette, waiting in line behind 
               her, whispers:

                                     LYNETTE
                         What do you think of the new 
                         mechanics?

               Paula glances off at the two boys Lynette is flirting with, 
               father back in the line. Both could be her father's sons.

               Candidates for apehood.

               Paula has a faraway look on her face as she pulls her card 
               from the clock.

                                     PAULA
                         Today's graduation. I hope he made 
                         it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE PARADE GROUND - DAY

               Zack and his classmates are passing in review before the 
               Commanding Officer and his staff (including Foley), seated 
               on the risers, and the large gathering of family and friends 
               seated on the folding chairs. The base marching band, a 
               phalanx to the left of the rises, is in fine and rousing 
               form.

               As Zack and Casey and Perryman and the others pass CAMERA, 
               they do a precise EYES-RIGHT.

               BYRON IS APPLAUDING LOUDER THAN ANYBODY

               It's a proud moment for the reluctant father and he's not 
               above letting the stiffer-looking parents around him know 
               how he feels about having a son made it into the officer 
               ranks.

               ZACK SEE HIS FATHER

               and smiles.

               SECONDS LATER, THE CAMERA IS PANNING THE FACE OF THE 
               GRADUATES.

               standing at attention on their risers, reciting their 
               commissioning oath.

                                     THE GRADUATES
                         I do solemnly swear that I will 
                         support and defend the Constitution 
                         of the United States of America 
                         against all enemies foreign and 
                         domestic...

               Find Casey's proud face, Perryman's, Della-Serra's, Marcus'...

                                     THE GRADUATES
                         ...that I will bear true faith and 
                         allegiance to the same, that I take 
                         this obligation freely without any 
                         mental reservation or purpose of 
                         evasion...

               CAMERA HOLDS ON Zack's face, his eyes moist, his voice rich 
               with emotion.

                                     ZACK
                              (with his classmates)
                         ...that I will well and faithfully 
                         discharge the duties of the office 
                         on which I am about to enter. So 
                         help me God.

               MINUTES LATER, THE NEWLY-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS HAVE BROKEN 
               RANKS

               and are embracing their families and friends on the lawn.

               Byron finds Zack and the two men stare at one another warily, 
               before warmth floods their faces and they come together in 
               an embrace. Zack pulls a folded document from his breast 
               pocket.

                                     ZACK
                         Look -- my orders to Pensacola for 
                         basic flight training... then it's 
                         on to jets!

               Byron quickly glances at the orders and pounds Zack on the 
               back.

                                     BYRON
                         I knew you'd make it!
                              (beat)
                         Where's your girl? Didn't she come?

                                     ZACK
                         Naw. That's over with.

               Byron almost looks sad to hear it.

                                     BYRON
                         Zackie, I'm so proud of you. Get 
                         ready, 'cause I'm gonna give you 
                         your first salute and you'll owe me 
                         a silver dollar. That's the tradition, 
                         you know.

               He starts to bring his hand up to salute his son but Zack 
               grabs his wrist to stop him.

                                     ZACK
                              (gently)
                         No offense, Byron, but my first one's 
                         gonna come from... him.

               He looks over at:

               FOLEY, IN DRESS BLUES

               He cane propped characteristically behind him, the newer 
               notches clearly recognizable from the ones that predate this 
               class, he watches them approach... one after the other, each 
               of his worms, his scuzzes, his college pukes... and he renders 
               to them, as is the tradition, their first salute. In return, 
               they hand him a silver dollar.

               Perryman pays up, then Casey approaches him.

                                     FOLEY
                              (saluting)
                         Congratulations Ensign Seeger, sir!

                                     CASEY
                         Thank you, sir. I mean, Sergeant.

               She gives him a silver dollar and hurries off to rejoin her 
               family.

               ZACK APPROACHES FOLEY

               and the Marine salutes him briskly, his heels clapping 
               together like a flamenco dancer's.

                                     FOLEY
                         Congratulations, Ensign Mayo, sir!

                                     ZACK
                         I'll never forget you as long as I 
                         live, Sergeant.

                                     FOLEY
                         I know.

                                     ZACK
                         Well, goodbye.

               Zack gives him a silver dollar and Foley pockets it and snaps 
               off another brisk salute.

                                     FOLEY
                         See you in the fleet, sir!

                                     ZACK
                         Yeah. See you in the fleet, Sarge. 
                         And thank you.

               Foley just grins as Zack answers his salute.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE BASE - DAY

               MOVING WITH ZACK ON HIS MOTORCYCLE. He still wears his dress 
               whites and his gear is packed in a Navy seabag strapped to 
               the back, as he drives away from the barracks, waving farewell 
               to some of his classmates. As he rumbles past the parade 
               ground, he sees Foley addressing a spanking new class of 
               candidates, still in civvies, still sporting hair.

                                     FOLEY
                         I don't believe what I'm seeing! 
                         Look at all that hair! All those 
                         lard bellies from junk food and pot! 
                         Where you been all your lives, at an 
                         orgy? Listening to Mick Jagger and 
                         bad mouthing your country, I bet.

               The new class cracks up, laughing, as Zack motors past, headed 
               for the gates. It's hard to believe only thirteen weeks have 
               elapsed since he heard those words for the first time. Seems 
               more like a lifetime.

               EXT. THE GATES OF THE NAVAL AIR STATION - DAY

               Zack drives out and disappears down the road.

                                                          SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. THE NATIONAL PAPER KILL - DAY

               Paula is at work on the line. The sweat of a long day stings 
               her eyes as it stings the eyes of her fellow workers. Poor 
               Paula. It's not hard to imagine her in a few years as Bunny.

               Hell, Lynette's already there. Old debs never die...

               THE WOMEN ON THE PAPER TOWEL LINE NEAR THE DOOR

               are the first to see him enter.

               ESTHER POKRIFKI

               stops her work as she sees the flash of gold on a Naval 
               shoulder board.

               THE WOMEN ON THE NAPKIN LINE

               send up a buzz of gossipy excitement as he strides past them.

               So clean. So handsome. So perfect. Every deb's fantasy.

               HE WEARS THE DRESS WHITE UNIFORM WITH ENSIGN GOLD

               and he wears it proudly as he strides through their ranks, 
               toward the girl who is only now stopping to watch him 
               approach.

               PAULA CAN'T BELIEVE IT

               Almost as she might have dreamed it long ago as a little 
               girl, she watches him take her face in his hands and kiss 
               her in such a romantic way that it's unlikely the women at 
               National Paper, or any of us, will ever forget that kiss.

               LYNETTE AND BUNNY WATCH THAT KISS

               with a mingling of happiness and painful, desperate longing, 
               on their faces.

               ESTHER POKRIFKI

               is the second happiest Deb in the room.

               THE OTHER AGING DEBS IN THE HUGE FACTORY

               stop their work to watch. A few even applaud.

               ZACK SUDDENLY LIFTS PAULA IN HIS ARMS

               and with their eyes still touching, he carries her toward 
               the door.

               LYNETTE'S FACE

               reveals all the jealousy that accompanies the happiness she 
               is feeling for her friend. She's never leaving this place 
               and she knows it.

                                     LYNETTE
                         Way to go, Paula! Way to go!

               She adds her applause and half the factory is clapping and 
               cheering by the time the officer and his girl reach the 
               doorway.

               EXT. THE NATIONAL PAPER MILL - DAY

               Zack carries Paula out into the sunshine and kisses her again.

               She's like candy, all right, and he'll never get enough. 
               PULL BACK INTO HELICOPTER SHOT that dwarfs them far below 
               us, and...

               FADE OUT.

                                         THE END
