In the life of Marty McFly, all is not well.
His family is dysfunctional, his school punctuality is questionable and the music he likes and plays is just too darn loud.
His one true light is his girlfriend Jenny and his one true friend is the somewhat off-kilter Doctor Emmett Brown.
In a request from Doctor Brown, Marty meets the mad scientist and discovers that his friend has built a time machine out of a DeLorean.
From there, Marty's humdrum life becomes literally a blast from the past as he is transported to 1955.
A stranger in a strange yet familiar land, Marty must seek out Doctor Brown to help send him back to his own time while simultaneously ensuring that his parents meet and fall in love.
