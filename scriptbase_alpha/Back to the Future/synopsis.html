The title logo appears on a black background. The scene opens in Doc Emmett Brown's (<a href="/name/nm0000502/">Christopher Lloyd</a>) garage home-cum-laboratory and we pan over a large collection of clocks. A robotic tin can opener opens a tin of bad dog food and empties the contents into an overflowing dog food bowl marked &quot;Einstein&quot;. The television set and radio turn on. On the TV, we see the ending of an advertisement, followed by a woman newscaster announcing the recent theft of a case of plutonium.<br/><br/>The front door of the garage opens, and Marty McFly (<a href="/name/nm0000150/">Michael J. Fox</a>) comes in. Marty calls out, then reaches down to partly lift up the doormat. He places a set of keys under the doormat, then drops it back down. Marty enters the garage, calling out for Doc and whistling for Einstein. He comments on the mess the place is in.<br/><br/>Marty puts down his skateboard and it rolls along the floor to hit a box under the table. The box is marked 'Plutonium', which Marty doesn't see. He turns on Doc's amplifier system, turning all the settings to maximum. A hum grows louder in the background. Marty plugs his electric guitar into a huge amplifier, pauses, and then plucks a string. The amplifier blows up, the impact throwing Marty back against a bookshelf, which falls, causing the books and papers on it to fall off and land on his head. Marty lifts up his sunglasses and we finally get to see his whole face.<br/><br/>&quot;Whoa... rock and roll,&quot; he says, when a loud ringing fills the garage. It sounds like a fire alarm, but then turns out to be just the telephone. Marty scrambles off the ground and answers it. It's Doc, who asks Marty to meet him that night at the Twin Pines Mall at 1:15 a.m.. Marty asks him where he's been all week. Doc says that he has been working. Marty tells him that his equipment had been left on all week. Remembering, Doc tells Marty not to hook up to the amplifier. &quot;There's a slight possibility of overload,&quot; he says. Marty glances at the destroyed amplifier, and says that he'll keep that in mind.<br/><br/>Just then, every single clock goes off at once, chiming loudly, and Doc asks about them. Marty tells him that it's eight o'clock. Doc is elated at the information, as it means that his experiment has worked and all his clocks are 25 minutes slow. Marty is shocked at the news. It means that it's really 8:25, and he's late for school. He exclaims this news into the telephone, slams down the receiver, retrieves his skateboard and rushes out of the garage. Marty gets on his skateboard and skates through the streets, hitching a ride first on a pickup truck and then on another Jeep to get through town.<br/><br/>Marty arrives outside Hill Valley High School. He hops off his skateboard and flips it up into his hand. His girlfriend Jennifer Parker (<a href="/name/nm0920148/">Claudia Wells</a>) is waiting for him. She warns him that the principal, Mr. Strickland (James Tolkan) is looking for him. Marty tells her that his lateness is not his fault, because Doc set his clocks slow. Strickland suddenly appears at the sound of Doc's name. He demands to know if Marty is still hanging around with Doc, and hands him and Jennifer a tardy slip each; it is Marty's fourth in a row. Strickland warns Marty that Doc is a dangerous nuctase, and if he continues hanging out with him, he'll get in trouble. Strickland also harshly tells Marty that he is a slacker, just like his father. &quot;No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley,&quot; he says, bringing his face closer to Marty's until their noses touch. &quot;Yeah, well,&quot; Marty says, &quot;history is gonna change.&quot;<br/><br/>We change to the auditorium, where a band has just finished playing. Four judges sit on chairs before the stage and request the next band. Marty and his band get up on stage and he introduces them as The Pinheads before launching into the opening bars of The Power of Love. One of the judges (the song's artist, Huey Lewis, in a cameo appearance) cuts them off and tells them that they are too loud.<br/><br/>After school, Marty and Jennifer are walking through the Courthouse Square as a mayoral campaign van drives past, blaring &quot;Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson!&quot; over its loudspeakers. Marty tells Jennifer about how he doubts he'll ever get anywhere with his music. Jennifer tries to reassure him with her opinion that he's really good, and encourages him to send in his audition tape to the record company. &quot;It's like Doc's always saying,&quot; Jennifer starts. &quot;Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything,&quot; Marty continues. His head turns, temporarily distracted by two girls walking past. Jennifer turns his head back towards her. &quot;That's good advice, Marty,&quot; she says.<br/><br/>They sit down on a bench together. Marty expresses his fear of rejection if he sends in the audition tape. He looks up as a new 4x4 Toyota is delivered at the car dealership, and admires it, saying how great it would be to have that truck to take up to the lake the next day. Jennifer asks if Marty's mother knows about their plans for the next night. Marty tells her that his mother thinks he's going camping with the guys, and that she would freak out if she knew the truth. Marty says how his mother was probably born a nun. Jennifer says that she's just trying to keep him respectable. Marty says that she's not doing a very good job. Their lips come closer, but just as they are about to touch, a tin can is shoved in their faces as a woman asks them to deposit money that will be contributed to a fund to save the clock tower, broken since it was struck by lightning 30 years ago. The mayor would like the clock to be replaced, but they at the Hill Valley Preservation Society thinks that it is important part of their heritage and should be left alone. Marty gives her a quarter to go away. She thanks him and hands him a flyer, before going off to target more unsuspecting passersby.<br/><br/>&quot;Where were we?&quot; Marty asks.<br/><br/>&quot;Right about here,&quot; Jennifer replies, and their lips get closer once more. Just as they are about to kiss, a car pulls up and beeps its horn loudly. Jennifer's father calls for her. She has to leave. Marty says he'll call her tonight; she says she'll be at her grandmother's, and scribbles the number on the back of the clock tower flyer with &quot;Love You!!!&quot; next to that. She gets into the car. Marty looks at the back of the flyer. He smiles, and The Power of Love starts playing again.<br/><br/>Marty gets back on his skateboard and grabs a police car to tail behind. He makes his way back to his home neighborhood, Lyon Estates. Marty lets go of a car and skims down this opening towards his house.<br/><br/>Outside his house he passes a wrecked car being towed up the driveway. Inside, Marty sees his father, George (<a href="/name/nm0000417/">Crispin Glover</a>) arguing with his supervisor, Biff Tannen (<a href="/name/nm0001855/">Thomas F. Wilson</a>). Biff is exasperated that George loaned him a car without telling him that it had a blind spot, and how he could have been killed. George insists that he never knew the car had a blind spot. He sees Marty and gives him a weak greeting, as Biff demands to know who is going to pay for his cleaning bill, seeing as how he spilled beer all over his coat when the other car collided with him. He asks George where his reports are. George says that he's not done with them, as he figured they weren't due yet. Biff raps George on the head, demanding &quot;Hello, hello, anybody home?&quot; George laughs nervously. Biff asks him to think; he needs time to retype the reports, as he'll get fired if he hands them in with George's handwriting. &quot;You wouldn't want that to happen, would you?&quot; Biff asks. &quot;Would you?&quot; he repeats, grabbing George by the collar when he doesn't respond. George assures him that he wouldn't, and promises to finish the reports by the next morning. Biff tells him that his shoes are untied. George looks down, at which point Biff slaps him under the chin while telling him not to be gullible, and heads off to the fridge. He expresses despair that all they've got is lite beer, and helps himself to a beer before leaving.<br/><br/>&quot;I know what you're gonna say, son,&quot; George says, &quot;and you're right, you're right, But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid I'm not very good at confrontations.&quot;<br/><br/>Marty asks about the car, which he had been planning to drive up to the lack with Jennifer. George apologizes.<br/><br/>The whole of the McFly family later sits down to dinner - George, his wife Lorraine (<a href="/name/nm0000670/">Lea Thompson</a>), and their children Marty, Dave (<a href="/name/nm0566013/">Marc McClure</a>) and Linda (<a href="/name/nm0818274/">Wendie Jo Sperber</a>). Lorraine drops a thin cake onto the table. It says 'Welcome Home, Joey', next to a picture of a bird flying out of jail. Uncle 'Jailbird' Joey has failed to make parole, again. Linda chides that he's an embarrassment to the family. Lorraine reminds her that everyone makes mistakes in life.<br/><br/>Having enough of the conversation, Dave leaves for his job at Burger King, while Linda tells Marty that Jennifer called twice for him. This upsets Lorraine, who lectures Marty that 'any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble.' When Linda tries to defend this, Lorraine grows upset, insisting that when she was Linda's age she never 'chased a boy, or called a boy, or sat in a parked car with a boy.' Linda asks how she's supposed to meet anyone if she is to go through life like her Mom did. Lorraine explains that it will happen just like she met George...who met Lorraine when her father hit him with his car. Linda then rolls her eyes, as Lorraine once again relates the story of how they met: supposedly, George was up in a tree (just what he was doing, George never explains), when he fell into the street and was hit by Lorraine's father. After taking him inside, and taking care of him, Lorraine felt sorry enough for George that she asked him to the Enchantment Under The Sea dance. When they had their first kiss at the dance, she knew she was going to spend the rest of her life with him.<br/><br/>Sometime after midnight, Marty is awoken by a call from Doc, who asks Marty to stop by the lab and pick up his video camera that he forgot. Marty does so, and heads to the Twin Pines Mall. When he gets there, he finds Doc's van sitting in the parking lot, with his dog, Einstein, sitting nearby. When Marty goes down to greet Einstein, the rear of the van opens up, and out emerges a DeLorean automobile, with all sorts of additions and modifications made to it. Doc Brown then emerges from the vehicle, greeting Marty, and getting right down to business as Marty is instructed to start recording on Doc's camera.<br/><br/>Doc places Einstein in the DeLorean, having Marty note the time on the watch around Einstein's collar, and in Doc's hand. Both are synched to the same time. Doc then closes the DeLorean's door, and pulls out a remote control, that he uses to maneuver the DeLorean around the parking lot. When the vehicle is a specific distance away, Doc puts its brakes on, and starts ramping up its speed, before turning off the brakes, sending the DeLorean streaking right towards him and Marty. Suddenly, a bright light is seen from inside the DeLorean, as additional fire and lights are set off around it, and suddenly, in a puff of light and electricity the DeLorean disappears, leaving a pair of fire trails behind from the red-hot tires. Doc excitedly cheers, yelling something about &quot;88 miles per hour&quot; but Marty is in shock, as it seems that Doc has just disintegrated Einstein.<br/><br/>Doc excitedly exclaims that he actually sent Einstein into the future... &quot;one minute into the future, to be exact!&quot; As Doc talks with Marty, the DeLorean materializes, now iced over. As Doc opens the door, Einstein is revealed to be alive and well, with his watch now one minute behind Doc's. Doc explains that Einstein likely believes that the trip was instantaneous. Doc shows Marty a device in the cabin called the &quot;flux capacitor&quot; which makes time travel possible. Doc explains that, after an accident in his bathroom in 1955 where he hit his head, he had a vision of the flux capacitor. Though it took 30 years of research and most of his family's fortune to develop it, the project is a success and Doc plans to travel through time. As he talks to Marty, Doc absently sets the vehicle's destination time to that date.<br/><br/>When Marty asks what the DeLorean runs on instead of gasoline, Doc tells him it needs plutonium, explaining that a nuclear reaction is necessary to generate 1.21 gigawatts to power the flux capacitor. Marty is alarmed, asking where the Doc could possibly have gotten such a substance and Doc tells him that he hired a couple of Libyan terrorists to steal it for him with the promise of building them a bomb. Doc, however, cheated them, delivering a fake bomb.<br/><br/>Doc and Marty, clad in yellow radiation suits, load another pellet of plutonium into the DeLorean and Doc begins his farewell address to Marty and the camera.<br/><br/>Just then, a Volkswagen van races into the parking lot. A man pops out of the roof with an AK-47 and begins shooting . Doc yells for Marty to run; in the van are the Libyans that Doc cheated. Doc tries to hide as well but that is when the Libyans' van comes to a stop in front of him. Doc throws away his revolver, showing that he intends to surrender, only for the Libyan to shoot him full of holes. Marty tries to hide but is found as well; when the Libyan tries to shoot him, his rifle jams. Marty jumps into the DeLorean and races off, the van close behind. As Marty swings back into the parking lot, he decides to see if the van can do 90 mph.<br/><br/>As he races towards a kiosk, Marty fails to see the speedometer pass 88 mph or the fact that the time clock is set to November 5, 1955.<br/><br/>Suddenly, there's a flash of light and the kiosk and parking lot are replaced with an empty grassy field, and the car plows right into a scarecrow. Marty ends up losing control of the DeLorean and it crashes into the side of a nearby barn. The noise wakes up the occupants of the farmhouse next door, Old Man Peabody and his family. They rush over to the barn where they keep their cows and are stunned to find what looks like an airplane without wings lying in their barn. His son Sherman decides that the car is actually an alien spaceship. Just then, the driver's door lifts up and Marty steps out, still clad in the radiation suit. Peabody and his family scream in terror, thinking Marty is an alien, and flee towards the house.<br/><br/>Marty attempts to apologize, when suddenly Peabody returns with a shotgun and fires on him. Marty jumps back in the DeLorean and speeds out of the barn, Peabody continuing to shoot with him. As Marty flees down the dirt path leading to the road, he inadvertently runs over one of two small pine trees lying next to the path and protected by a picket fence. Peabody shoots at the car, in the process destroying his own mailbox, shouting, &quot;You killed my pine!&quot;<br/><br/>Marty reaches the two lane road and speeds off, muttering that the experience must be a nightmare, heading for home. When he gets to Lyon Estates, he finds the stone gates marking the entrance to the neighborhood, but to his surprise, instead of a street lined with houses, there is just an empty grassy field with several construction vehicles sitting idle and a large billboard advertising the future housing development that is breaking ground next winter.<br/><br/>Marty, still clad in his radiation suit, sees two motorists coming along the road and attempts to hitchhike, but they freak out and ignore him. Discovering that the DeLorean is out of gas, Marty removes his radiation suit and pushes the DeLorean back behind the billboard to hide it from passing motorists, then notices a sign saying that it is two miles to Hill Valley.<br/><br/>Marty is next seen walking into the courthouse square of downtown Hill Valley. Hill Valley of 1955 is a lot different to Marty. The courthouse square is an actual garden instead of a parking lot. The movie theater is playing <i><a href="/title/tt0046839/">Cattle Queen of Montana</a></I>. The Texaco station is a full service station where attendants not just fill up the tank but also wash the windows and check the customer's engine and tires. A mayoral campaign car also drives around the square, blaring &quot;Reelect Mayor Red Thomas!&quot;<br/><br/>Marty steps into Lou's Diner (which is an aerobic class in 1985), at this point only inhabited by Lou Caruthers, the owner, and another customer eating breakfast at the counter. Marty goes to the phone booth and looks up Doc's address in the phonebook, tearing the page out so he can look it up later. As Marty tries to ask for directions, Lou demands that Marty either order something or leave. Marty gets himself some decaf coffee after misunderstandings about Pepsi Free and Tab.<br/><br/>Marty scratches his head, still in disbelief that he's in the past. As soon as Lou sets the coffee cup down in front of Marty, the camera pans to reveal that the other customer at the counter is scratching his head in an identical way to Marty, revealing that he is Marty's future father. Just then, the doors fly open and in walks Biff and his friends Match, Skinhead and 3D, who have come to harass George. It turns out that Biff has been bullying George by forcing him to do his homework, something George has been slacking off on. George says that he hasn't completed it, figuring that it wasn't due until Monday. Biff raps George on the head, demanding &quot;Hello, hello! anybody home?&quot; George laughs nervously. Biff asks him to think; he needs time to recopy it, as he'll get expelled if he hands in his homework in George's handwriting. &quot;You wouldn't want that to happen, would you?&quot; Biff asks. &quot;Would you?&quot; he repeats, grabbing George by the collar when he doesn't respond. George assures him that he wouldn't, and promises to finish Biff's homework by the next morning. Just like in 1985, Biff tells him that his shoes are untied. George looks down, at which point Biff slaps him under the chin while telling him not to be gullible, and then leaves with his friends.<br/><br/>After Biff and his friends leave, the diner's busboy, Goldie Wilson (Donald Fullilove), chides George for letting Biff harass him all day. George insists that Biff is bigger than him, while Goldie points out that he doesn't expect to spend the rest of his own life working as a busboy, and he is going to be someone. Marty immediately recognizes Goldie and accidentally blurts out that he will become mayor in 1985. This plants the idea in Goldie's mind and he begins to think about how as mayor he'll clean up the town (to which Lou responds by giving him a broom and telling him to sweep the floor).<br/><br/>After George leaves the diner, Marty's curiosity is piqued and he follows him into another neighborhood. He momentarily loses track until he finds George's bike parked beneath a tree. He looks up and notices George on a tree branch, using a pair of binoculars to look at a girl getting undressed in her room across the street. As he's straining to get a better look, George slips and falls out of the tree, landing in the path of an oncoming car. Marty, not realizing that this is how his parents will meet, rushes out and pushes George out of the way and is himself hit by the car and knocked out. George gets on his bike and rides away as Sam Baines, the driver, yells to his wife that another kid has jumped in front of his car.<br/><br/>Marty wakes up that night in an unfamiliar bed. His mother's voice reassures him that he's been asleep for nine hours. Marty talks about how he dreamed he went back in time. Lorraine's voice reassures him that he's safe and sound in 1955. This causes Marty to bolt upright just as a light is turned on, revealing Lorraine, at this point still a young and attractive teenage girl. She begins to hit on Marty almost immediately, mistakenly calling him &quot;Calvin Klein&quot; (due to that being the brand of underwear Marty is wearing). Marty instinctively panics when Lorraine tries to make advances on him. This is interrupted when Lorraine's mother Stella calls her down for dinner.<br/><br/>At dinner, Marty meets Lorraine's family, including a little baby who is his future uncle Joey, the prison inmate, whom his mother says cries every time they take him out of his crib (leading Marty to joke to Joey, &quot;Better get used to these bars, kid...&quot;). The family eats while watching &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; on the new television Sam has just purchased. Marty immediately recognizes the episode they are watching as one he watched in 1985, which he explains by saying that he saw it in a rerun. Marty asks how to find Doc's address, which Lorraine's father says is over on the east end of town. Marty knows that area as &quot;John F. Kennedy Drive&quot;, a name that Lorraine's father doesn't know. As Marty leaves the house, Sam warns Lorraine that if she ever has a kid like Marty, he will disown her.<br/><br/>Marty finds Doc Brown's house (which will be destroyed in a fire sometime in the next 30 years, forcing Doc to live in his garage). When Doc, who does not recognize Marty, answers the door, he immediately hooks Marty up to an invention he thinks can read other people's minds. Doc determines that Marty comes from a great distance, and wants him to make a donation to the Coast Guard Youth Auxiliary. Frustrated, Marty tells Doc directly that his time machine works and he's from the future. Doc is skeptical, even when Marty shows him his future driver's license and a family photo. Doc comments that the photo must have been forged as Dave's head is beginning to disappear. However, Marty is able to convince Doc of the truth by mentioning the wound on his head that prompted the vision of the flux capacitor. To prove that Doc has invented it, Marty has Doc drive him out to the place where he's hidden the DeLorean.<br/><br/>After returning to Doc's estate, they manage to watch the videotape Marty had shot in 1985. Doc becomes panicky when they reach the point where the future Doc says that time travel requires 1.21 gigawatts of power to work. Doc explains that plutonium is very hard to come by in 1955 and that the only energy source capable of that amount of power is a lightning bolt. Predicting the strike zone of a lightning bolt is impossible and Doc tells Marty he may be stuck forever in 1955. Marty remembers the flyer the woman gave him about the lightning bolt that is going to strike the clock tower at 10:04 PM next Saturday night. Now that he knows a date, Doc begins working on a plan to harness the power of the bolt and send Marty home. When Marty says he can hang out in 1955 for a week, Doc says it could be detrimental to future history and jeopardize his entire existence. He asks Marty if he had any interaction with anyone in the last few hours and Marty drops the bomb about preventing the first meeting between his father and mother. Doc asks to see the photo of Marty and his siblings again. Now he realizes that Dave's vanishing appearance from the photo is a result of Marty's interference in the past, meaning that before he goes back to 1985, he needs to make his parents fall in love and have their first kiss.<br/><br/>Doc takes Marty to the high school the next morning. We notice that there is no graffiti on the front steps, unlike in 1985. After peeping through a classroom window and watching Lorraine cheating on a test, they spot George in the hallway, seeing him being picked on (in part because of the large &quot;KICK ME&quot; note taped to his back). George is further demoralized when Strickland (who in 1955 has a very receded hairline and is almost bald) calls him a slacker.<br/><br/>Marty tries encouraging George to talk to Lorraine, however, he fails because Lorraine is already smitten with Marty. Doc finds that the situation is more serious than they'd thought; George lacks the self-confidence to ask Lorraine out, as he fears that he couldn't handle a rejection if she said &quot;no&quot;, and getting them together permanently could be impossible. Over lunch, Marty tries again to convince George by saying Lorraine has been talking about him and that he should ask her to the Enchantment Under the Sea dance. George spends his lunch by himself writing science fiction short stories. Marty asks to read one of them and George refuses, saying he's afraid people would be critical. He also suggests that Lorraine may want to go with someone else to the dance, namely Biff, who is across the cafeteria, sitting with Lorraine and trying to grope her. Marty immediately marches over to them and pulls Biff off his mother. Biff begins pushing Marty, however, Marty, unlike his meek father, begins pushing back and is about to fight Biff when Strickland breaks it up.<br/><br/>Marty follows George home and begins pleading with George to ask Lorraine out. George continues to refuse and tells Marty that no one in the world will make him change his mind. That night, Marty breaks into George's room in his radiation suit. To wake George up, he places his Walkman headphones on George and gives him a blast of ear-splitting Eddie Van Halen guitar riffing. He tells George he's &quot;Darth Vader&quot; an alien from the planet &quot;Vulcan&quot; and orders him to ask Lorraine out, threatening to melt his brain if he doesn't.<br/><br/>Marty takes George back to Lou's diner, where Lorraine is hanging out with her friends. He gives George a few romantic lines to use on Lorraine which, at first, seem to work, though they sound rather awkward. However, George's efforts are foiled with Biff shows up, and demands money. Marty steps in to defend George, and races out when he's able to distract Biff. Marty grabs a little girl's scooter, tears off the crate and turns the bottom into a skateboard. Biff and his goons chase Marty in Biff's car around the town square. Marty is able to avoid serious injury. While riding on the hood of Biff's car, he distracts them by suddenly jumping up, jumping over the windshield and the backseat, and then hopping off. Biff and his friends are confused, and then see they are barreling towards a parked manure truck at high speed. They can only shout &quot;SSHHIIIIIITTTTT!!!&quot; as Biff spins and the car slams sideways into the back of the truck, which dumps its entire load on Biff and his friends. Watching the chase from the diner, Lorraine becomes even more attracted to the adventurous Marty.<br/><br/>Back at Doc's shop, the inventor shows Marty how he'll use the lighting bolt to power the DeLorean. He'll string heavy cable down to the street, building a circuit. A hook attached to the back of the car will channel the bolt directly into the flux capacitor. The timing will have to be precise. The demonstration goes well, though it sets a garbage pail on fire. They are interrupted by a knock at the door. To Doc's shock, it's Lorraine, who has followed Marty. Doc and Marty quickly cover the DeLorean with a tarp before letting Lorraine into the garage. Lorraine asks Marty to be her date to the Enchantment Under the Sea dance and Marty reluctantly accepts. Marty suddenly sees a way to get George to win Lorraine's heart. Marty approaches George while George is doing his parents' laundry, and tells him to find him with Lorraine in Doc's car in the school parking lot at a certain time, where Marty plans to &quot;take advantage&quot; of her. George is to pull Marty out of the car and pretend to beat him up, proving that he's the bigger man.<br/><br/>The night of the dance arrives. George is already there, in a tux, waiting for his cue. At Lou's Diner, Marty writes Doc a letter that tells him he'll be killed by the Libyans in 1985 and that the Doc should do whatever he can to prevent it. He slips the note into the pocket of Doc's coat.<br/><br/>Marty arrives at the dance in Doc's car with Lorraine and asks her if they can &quot;park&quot; for a while. Lorraine produces a small bottle of whiskey and begins to smoke, both habits she has in 1985. Marty tells her she may regret it later and Lorraine dismisses it, exasperated that Marty sounds like her mother. She also is aggressive in coming on to Marty in the car, much more than Marty had anticipated, though she thinks something is up when she says that kissing Marty feels like kissing her brother.<br/><br/>Just then, the door is opened and Marty is pulled roughly from the driver's seat. But it's not George. It's Biff, drunk, and seeking revenge for the $300 in damages Marty inflicted on his car in the manure truck accident. When Biff sees Lorraine in the car, however, he throws Marty to Match, Skinhead and 3D, climbs into the car, and begins to molest her. Match, Skinhead and 3D take Marty out behind the school and toss him into the open trunk of a nearby car, then slam the lid shut. Unfortunately for them, the car belongs to Marvin Berry of the Starlighters, the leader of the band performing at the dance. The band scares Biff's gang off and they realize that the keys are in the trunk with Marty.<br/><br/>Back at Doc's car, George arrives and begins to threaten the man he thinks is Marty but is shocked to find Biff there instead. He takes a half-hearted punch at Biff, who grabs his arm and begins to twist it. When Biff roughly pushes a pleading Lorraine off and begins laughing, George summons up the strength and courage and punches Biff squarely on the jaw, knocking him out. Marty, freed from the trunk thanks to Marvin Berry himself, races to the scene just in time to see Biff knocked out. George takes Lorraine's hand and the two go into the dance hall.<br/><br/>Marty, knowing that his future isn't sealed until George kisses Lorraine, goes back to the band and finds that Marvin is unable to play having injured his hand while freeing Marty from the trunk. Marty agrees to play guitar in Marvin's place and the band strikes up again, playing a romantic song (&quot;Earth Angel&quot;). Marty, already weak because his parents' love is not confirmed, begins to fade into non-existence when a fellow student cuts in between George and Lorraine on the dance floor, however, George regains his courage, takes Lorraine back and kisses her passionately. Marty is instantly revived and finishes the song and sees his mother and father happily in each others arms.<br/><br/>Berry asks Marty to play another number with the band. Reluctant at first, Marty can't resist the opportunity and launches the band into &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot;. After a few minutes, Marty becomes carried away and plays wildly, much like Berry's cousin, Chuck (the yet-to-be-famous rock n' roll star). Stopping himself while lost in heavy metal riffing, Marty tells the students &quot;I guess you're not ready for *that*. But your kids are gonna LOVE it.&quot; Marty turns to leave the dance and runs into George and Lorraine. Lorraine asks if it's OK for George to take her home and Marty heartily agrees. He also tells them that if they have a son who &quot;accidentally sets fire to the living room rug&quot; to &quot;go easy&quot; on him.<br/><br/>At the town square, Doc waits impatiently for Marty. Marty arrives, saying he needed time to change back into his 80s clothes. As they prepare for the event, Doc discovers the note from Marty in his pocket. Refusing to know too much about his future, he tears up the note without reading it. Just then, a falling tree limb disconnects the cabling he has installed from the clock tower to the street. Doc climbs again to the clock tower and has Marty feed him the cable. Marty also tries to warn Doc about his death but is drowned out by thunder. Marty runs back to the DeLorean and races off to the starting point Doc has painted for him. While waiting for the timer to go off, he resets his destination time to arrive 11 minutes earlier than he left so he can warn Doc. Just then, the car stalls and Marty frantically tries to start it again. When it does restart, after the timer goes off, Marty begins speeding toward the town square. Despite some difficulty, Doc reconnects the cable just as the lighting bolt surges through the line and the DeLorean speeds off into the future, leaving behind the familiar flaming trails. Doc celebrates joyously in the street.<br/><br/>Marty arrives safely in 1985. However, the temperamental car stalls again and Marty is forced to run to the mall where the initial experiment is taking place. As he arrives, we see that the sign now reads &quot;Lone Pine Mall,&quot; another indication of how Marty has accidentally altered the past. He sees Doc get shot, again and then sees himself race back to 1955 in the DeLorean. After the time machine has disappeared, Marty runs down to Doc. Marty is devastated that he couldn't arrive in time to save Doc. Doc, however, sits up. Marty is stunned until Doc opens his shirt, revealing that he's wearing a bulletproof vest. Marty asks him about the consequences of changing the future and the space-time continuum and the Doc says &quot;Well, I thought, 'What the hell!'&quot;. Doc drives Marty home and tells him he plans to venture about 30 years into the future.<br/><br/>Marty wakes up the next morning to find that the furniture in his house is arranged differently. Dave is wearing a suit and working for an accounting job. His sister seems to be having trouble keeping track of all the teenaged boys who keep calling her for dates, much to Dave's exasperation. George and Lorraine arrive home from a tennis match, happy and even a bit frisky. Lorraine asks Marty about the camping trip he has planned with Jennifer, to which Marty mentions that the car is wrecked. Everyone starts barking about it until George shows them that Biff is waxing the car (a BMW) in the driveway. Biff comes into the house carrying a box filled with copies of George's first published book, the cover of which resembles Marty's appearance in the radiation suit. Marty is unsure how to take everything in when Biff hands him a set of keys. They are for the Toyota pickup truck that belongs to him in the garage.
