In LA, Nic and Jules are a couple with a daughter, Joni, on her way to college and a son, Laser, at 15 a good athlete but maybe hanging out with the wrong pal.
Laser wants Joni, who's now 18, to find out who their biological father is - a sperm donor.
Without initially telling their moms, they meet him.
He's Paul, a cool guy with a motorcycle, a restaurant, and an organic garden.
Although Nic doesn't like the idea, the five of them get together a few times and the kids spend time with Paul.
He hires Jules, who's had many brief vocations, to landscape his back yard, and Nic, who's an OB/GYN, decides to be a good sport and get to know Paul better.
