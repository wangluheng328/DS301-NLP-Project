Gary is a troubled actor who is wearing a green bracelet on his wrist, under house arrest living in another person's house because he burned down his own.
The owner of the house is described as a TV writer away on work.
While living in the house he is befriended by both a P.R.
'handler', Margaret, and the single mom next door, Sarah, who may or may not be interested in him romantically.
Over the course of his house arrest, Gary becomes convinced that he is being haunted by the number nine, including finding a note saying "Look for the nines" in his handwriting.
He encounters many occurrences of the number nine, while playing backgammon he rolls nines, while reading newspaper advertisements he becomes obsessed with finding nines.
Asking Sarah about the number 9 worries her and she cryptically tells him "I can get you out of here".
He also sees different versions of himself around the house, which unsettles him, causing him to break out of his house arrest barrier, which in turn causes a blip in reality.
