In 1971, NASA plans to send out people to the Moon for a lunar mission.
They have chosen astronauts Jim Lovell, Frad Haise, and Jack Swigert.
They have launched into outer space successfully, however, a slight fault from inside the space module caused an explosion that turned the exploration into a test for survival for the crew of Apollo 13.
While Loveel, Haise, and Swigert try to survive in space.
The workers at NASA (including Ken Mattingly) try to figure out a way to get the astronauts home safely.
