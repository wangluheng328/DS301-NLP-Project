The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad consists of five most deadly killers, led by Bill.
There is O'Ren-Ishii as Cottonmouth, Elle Driver as California Mountain Snake, Vernita Green as Copperhead, Budd as Sidewinder.
And there is The Bride, whose name is not spoken, who wanted to quit because she was pregnant.
One day, somewhere in the Texas desert, The Bride wanted to marry the love of her life.
Then Bill and her former colleagues showed up and killed everyone there.
But they did not do a good enough job: The Bride survives, barely, and is in a coma for four years.
Her colleagues know this but won't kill her in her sleep, it would just ruin the reputation.
One day, The Bride awakens.
For her, not a second has consciously passed, and after she realizes all the things that have happened, The Bride decides to take revenge.
Bloody revenge.
On each single one of those who betrayed her.
First on her death list is Cottonmouth, who has become the yakuza boss of Tokyo, Japan, second in line is Copperhead, who chose a more decent life as well.
The Bride sets out to take back what was once hers: Her life.
