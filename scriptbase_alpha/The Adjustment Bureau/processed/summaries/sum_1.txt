David Norris is an up and coming politician but on a night when he loses a Congressional election a chance meeting with a stranger, Elise Sellas, inspires him to make a brilliant concession speech that clearly makes him the front-runner for the next time around.
They meet again by chance a few years later and are intent on seeing one another.
What they do not realize is that there is a mysterious group of men calling themselves the Adjustment Bureau, who seem intent on keeping them apart.
Soon David and Elise are on the run with the Bureau trying their best to separate them as they try to maintain David's predetermined future.
