After winning a trip on the RMS Titanic during a dockside card game, American Jack Dawson spots the society girl Rose DeWitt Bukater who is on her way to Philadelphia to marry her rich snob fianc√© Caledon Hockley.
Rose feels helplessly trapped by her situation and makes her way to the aft deck and thinks of suicide until she is rescued by Jack.
Cal is therefore obliged to invite Jack to dine at their first-class table where he suffers through the slights of his snobbish hosts.
In return, he spirits Rose off to third-class for an evening of dancing, giving her the time of her life.
Deciding to forsake her intended future all together, Rose asks Jack, who has made his living making sketches on the streets of Paris, to draw her in the nude wearing the invaluable blue diamond Cal has given her.
Cal finds out and has Jack locked away.
Soon afterwards, the ship hits an iceberg and Rose must find Jack while both must run from Cal even as the ship sinks deeper into the freezing water.
