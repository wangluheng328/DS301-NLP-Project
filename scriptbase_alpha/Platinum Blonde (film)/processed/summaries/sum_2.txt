Anything that the wealthy Schuyler family does is considered newsworthy.
So when a possible scandal erupts within the family, sarcastic reporter Stew Smith is among those clamoring to break the story.
But against the odds, Stew and the Schuyler's daughter, Anne, fall in love, and get married.
But once married, will Stew be able to fit within the stuffy Schuyler lifestyle, including being part of the newsworthy family?
And will Anne be freewheeling enough to hang out with Stew's friends?
Most of Anne's family don't like the fact of Stew, and most of Stew's colleagues think Stew is now a kept man.
But the one person who keeps her thoughts to herself is Stew's best reporter pal, Gallagher, who secretly loves her colleague.
