<b>			 BEING JOHN MALKOVICH
</b>
		   A Screenplay by Charlie Kaufman



<b>	INT. CHEERLESS ROOM - DAY
</b>
	The room is bare, dusty. A ceiling fan turns. The 
	wall clock ticks. Craig, 30 years old and small, sits at
	a collapsible card table. The only item on the table is a
	book. Craig picks it up, looks at the jacket. It's entitled
	"Sit." Craig opens the book. It reads: "sit sit sit sit
	sit..." over and over, page after page. Craig closes the
	book. He begins to stand, but thinks better of it, sighs.
	He looks at the book again. It is now entitled "Die."  He
	opens it up.  "die die die die die..."  A rooster crows.


<b>									CUT TO:
</b>

<b>	INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S BEDROOM - MORNING
</b>
	Craig jolts awake. A rooster stands on Craig's chest,
	crowing. Lotte, also 30, in the middle of dressing for 
	work, hurries in and pulls the bird from Craig's chest.


<b>				 LOTTE
</b>		    Sorry, hon. I didn't know Orrin
		    Hatch was out of his pen. Good
		    morning.


	Lotte leans down and kisses Craig on the forehead.

<b>				 CRAIG
</b>		    Morning.

<b>				 LOTTE
</b>		    Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms
		    coming in first thing.

<b>				 CRAIG
</b>		    Enjoy.

<b>				 LOTTE
</b>		    Craig, listen, honey, I've been
		    thinking... maybe you'd feel better
		    if you got, you know, a job or
		    something.

<b>				 CRAIG
</b>		    We've been over this. Nobody's
		    looking for a puppeteer in today's
		    wintry economic climate.

<b>				 LOTTE
</b>		    Well, you know, maybe something else
		    until this whole puppet thing turns
		    around.

<b>				 CRAIG
</b>			    (bitterly)
		    The Great Mantini doesn't need a day
		    job.

<b>				 LOTTE
</b>			    (sighs)
		    Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini.
			    (beat)
		    Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me
		    a favor?

<b>				 CRAIG
</b>		    What?

<b>				 LOTTE
</b>		    Would you check in on Elijah? He seems
		    to be a little under the weather this
		    morning.

<b>				 CRAIG
</b>		    Which one is Elijah again?

<b>				 LOTTE
</b>		    The monkey.

<b>				 CRAIG
</b>		    Yeah. Okay.

<b>									CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE' S GARAGE - MORNING
</b>
	The place is a mess. Vivaldi blasts through cheap speakers.
	A small marionette stage stands in the back of the garage.
	The stage is lit and on it is a finely sculpted puppet 
	version of Craig. The "Craig" puppet paces back and forth, 
	wringing its hands with incredible subtlety. We see Craig,
	above and behind the stage. He is manipulating the puppet.
	His fingers move fast and furious. The puppet breaks into
	a dance, a beautiful and intricate balletic piece. Soon the
	puppet is leaping and tumbling through space, moves that one
	would think impossible for a marionette. Sweat appears on
	the real Craig’s brow. His fingers move like lightning. The
	puppet moves faster and faster. Sweat appears on the puppet's
	brow. We see that the sweat is being piped from a special
	device that the real Craig controls. The Craig puppet
	collapses on the floor of the stage. It puts its hands up to
	its face and weeps. Craig hangs the puppet, and comes down
	around the front of the stage. He is heaving. He switches
	off the music, picks up a beer and takes a swig.

<b>									CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>
	The room is filled with penned and unpenned animals of all
	kinds: snakes, lizards, birds, a dog, cats, etc. Craig sits
	on the couch and looks at the want ads, the TV is on in the 
	background. Elijah, the monkey, sits next to Craig holding
	his stomach and moaning weakly. On the TV, Derek Mantini is
	working a 60 foot high marionette from the top of a water tower.
	The assembled crowd is enthralled.


<b>				 TV ANNOUNCER
</b>		    The crowd is enthralled as Derek
		    Mantini, arguably the greatest
		    puppeteer in the history of the 
		    world, performs "The Belle of
		    Amherst" with his 60 foot Emily
		    Dickinson puppet, directed by the
		    inimitable Charles Nelson Reilly.

	Charles Nelson Reilly floats by in a hot air balloon.

<b>				 CHARLES NELSON REILLY
</b>		    Beautiful, beautiful! Nyong-nyong.

<b>				 CRAIG
</b>		    Gimmicky bastard.

	Craig switches off the TV. He comes across an ad for a
	female puppeteer to teach at a girls school. Craig rubs 
	his chin in thought, then stands with great determination. 


<b>	MUSIC IN: TRIUMPHANT
</b>
<b>									CUT TO:

<b>									CUT TO:

<b>	INT. HEADMISTRESS’S OFFICE - DAY

	animated and charming. The admiring headmistress smiles 
	and nods her head in approval.

<b>									CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT. CLASSROOM - DAY
</b>
	Craig instructs a class of uniformed girls. He draws
	complex diagrams of puppets on the blackboard. The
	students are transfixed, except for one troubled girl who
	eyes Craig sullenly from the back of the room as she plays
	with a switchblade.

<b>									CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT. THEATER - DAY
</b>
	Craig guides the hands of the troubled teenage girl, who
	is trying to manipulate a marionette. The girl looks up
	at Craig. Her tough facade crumbles and she smiles. Craig 
	smiles back.

<b>									CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY
</b>
	The girls carry Craig on their shoulders. Everyone is joyous.

<b>									CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

	and screaming. One of the girls notices that Craig is
	riding a man's bike.

<b>	MUSIC OUT.
</b>
<b>									CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT
</b>
	Craig sits in a holding cell with several other men. He is
	still in the dress, but the wig is in his lap and the
	make-up is smeared off. Lotte appears with a cop outside
	Craig's cell. The door is opened, and Craig, Lotte, and
	the cop head down the hall.

<b>									CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT. CAR - NIGHT
</b>
	Lotte drives. Craig looks out the window. Both are silent.

<b>				 LOTTE
</b>			    (finally)
		    Is the trial date set?

<b>				 CRAIG
</b>		    May 11th.

       More silence.

<b>				 LOTTE
</b>		    Why'd you do it, Craig?

<b>				 CRAIG
</b>		    I'm a puppeteer.

	They drive in silence.

<b>									CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING
</b>
	Craig sits on the couch in his bathrobe and studies the
	want ads. He sees an ad for a company called "WOMYN-TEERS", 
	looking for "an African-American, Lesbian Separatist
	Puppeteer for Community Outreach." Craig rubs his chin in
	thought, stands with determination.


<b>	MUSIC IN: SAME AS BEFORE.

	Craig, dressed as the black lesbian and beaten to a pulp.
	sits in the passenger seat. Lotte drives.

<b>				 LOTTE
</b>			    (finally)
		    Why, Craig. why?

<b>				 CRAIG
</b>			    (through fat lip)
		    I... puppeteer.

<b>									CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>
	Craig reads the paper. He comes across an ad: "Female
	puppeteer wanted for nudist colony marionette staging of
	'Oh, Calcutta!'"  Craig rubs his chin.

<b>									CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT. CAR - NIGHT
</b>
	Craig sits in the passenger seat. He is made up as a
	woman and wears a full-body rubber "naked woman" suit.
	Lotte drives.

<b>				 LOTTE
</b>			    (finally)
		    You know, maybe you should speak to
		    someone about this.

<b>									CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE' S LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>
	Craig sees a personal ad: "Male puppeteer looking for
	attractive female puppeteer for friendship, travel, and
	much much more."  Craig rubs his chin, then thinks better
	of it and sighs. He finds a want ad calling for a
	"short-statured file clerk with unusually nimble and
	dexterous fingers needed for speed filing."  Craig writes
	down the address.

<b>									CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT. OFFICE BUILDING LOBBY - DAY
</b>
	Craig. in sport coat and tie, studies the business listings
	board. He finds LesterCorp, and sees that it is located on
	floor 7 1/2. Craig presses the elevator button and waits.
	Another man comes and waits next to him. The doors open,
	and Craig and the other man get in.

<b>									CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	The other man presses "9." Craig studies the buttons. There
	is no "7 1/2."

<b>				 WOMAN #1
</b>		    Seven and a half, right?

<b>				 CRAIG
</b>		    Uh. yeah.

<b>				 WOMAN #1
</b>		    I'll take you through it.

	The man picks up a crowbar leaning in the corner. He
	watches the floor numbers light up in succession. After
	"7" and before "8", the man hits the emergency stop button.
	The elevator slams to a halt. The man pries open the doors
	with the crowbar. Revealed is a standard office building
	hallway, except that from floor to ceiling it is only about
	four feet high. Everything is scaled down accordingly.
	The number on the wall across from the elevator is 7 1/2.

<b>				 WOMAN #1
</b>		    Seven and a half.

<b>				 CRAIG
</b>		    Thank you.

	Craig climbs out onto the 7 1/2 floor.

<b>									CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT. SEVEN AND A HALF FLOOR - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	Craig, hunched-over, makes his way down the hallway
	looking for LesterCorp. He passes a hunched-over man
	walking in the other direction. They nod to each other.
	Craig finds a door marked "LesterCorp - Meeting America's
	Filing Needs Since 1922."  He enters.

<b>									CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT. LESTERCORP RECEPTION AREA - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	All furniture is scaled down to fit into this low-ceilinged
	space. A few other short men sit reading tiny magazines.
	Craig approaches Floris, the receptionist.

<b>				 FLORIS
</b>		    Welcome to LesterCorp. May we meet
		    your filing needs?

<b>				 CRAIG
</b>		    No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz.
		    I have an interview with Mr. Lester.

<b>				 FLORIS
</b>		    Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez...

<b>				 CRAIG
</b>		    Schwartz.

<b>				 FLORIS
</b>		    Pardon?

<b>				 CRAIG
</b>		    Schwartz.

<b>				 FLORIS
</b>		    I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have no idea
		    what you're saying right now.

<b>				 CRAIG
</b>		    My name is Schwartz.

<b>				 FLORIS
</b>		    Money, Miss Warts?

<b>				 CRAIG
</b>		    Forget it.

	Craig takes a seat next to the other applicants.

<b>				 FLORIS
</b>			    (calling across the room)
		    Fork ah did?

	The intercom buzzes. Floris picks it up.

<b>				 FLORIS
</b>			    (to Craig)
		    Mr. Juarez?

<b>				 CRAIG
</b>		    Yes?

<b>				 FLORIS
</b>		    Yex?

<b>				 CRAIG
</b>		    I said "yes."

<b>				 FLORIS
</b>		    You suggest what? I have no time for
		    piddling suggestions from mumbling job
		    applicants, my good man. Besides, Dr.
		    Lester will see you now. I think
		    that's what he said.

	Craig stands, opens Lester's door, and enters.

<b>									CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT. LESTER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	Craig enters. Lester, a giant of an old man, sits hunched
	behind his tiny desk.

<b>				 LESTER
</b>		    Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but,
		    well, you know.

<b>				 CRAIG
</b>			    (extending his hand)
		    Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz,
		    Dr. Lester.

	Lester flips an intercom switch.

<b>				 LESTER

<b>				 WENDY
</b>		    Don, I was wondering, do you know
		    why our workplace has such low
		    ceilings?

<b>				 DON
</b>		    It's an interesting story, Wendy.
		    Many years ago in the late 1800's,
		    James Mertin, an Irish ship captain
		    looking to invest in the future of
		    our great country, came to this town
		    and decided to erect an office
		    building.

		    unexpected visitor.

	There is a knock at the door.

<b>				 MERTIN
</b>		    Enter ye, if ye dare enter.

	A tiny woman enters.

<b>				 TINY WOMAN
</b>		    Captain Mertin?

<b>				 MERTIN
</b>		    What want ye, girl child?

<b>				 TINY WOMAN
</b>		    I am not a child, Captain Mertin,
		    but rather an adult lady of miniature
		    proportions.

<b>				 MERTIN
</b>			    (taken aback)
		    I see. Well, it is not my fault that
		    thou art tiny. So if it is charity
		    yer after, then be gone with ye,
		    ye foul demon.

<b>				 TINY WOMAN
</b>		    I am not asking for alms, but rather
		    the ear of a kind man with a noble
		    heart.

<b>				 MERTIN
</b>			    (sighs)
		    Aye. Speak then if ye must.

<b>				 TINY WOMAN
</b>		    Captain Mertin, surely I am a
		    God-fearing Christian woman like
		    yourself, but alas, I am afraid that
		    the world was not built with me in
		    mind. Door knobs are too high, chairs
		    are unwieldy, high-ceilinged rooms
		    mock my stature. Nor am I a marrie
		    lady, Captain. after all, who would
		    marry a person of my diminutiveness?
		    So I am forced to work for my few
		    pennies a week as an optometrist.
		    Why cannot there be a place for me
		    to work safe and comfortable?

	Mertin wipes a tear from his eye.

<b>				 MERTIN
</b>		    Woman, your story moves me like n
		    other. Me own sister was tiny and
		    then died. Therefore, I shall make
		    ye me wife. And I shall build a
		    floor in my building, between the
		    7th and 8th, which will be scaled
		    down, so from now on there shall
		    be at least one place on God's green

		    Sorry, I'm so late. Lester just

		    I can get us out of it if you want.
		    He's really amazing, this insane old

		    Tell me, Craig, why do you love

			    (as Craig)
		    Well, Maxine, I'm not sure exactly.
		    Perhaps it's the idea of becoming

		    Being inside another skin. Moving
		    differently, thinking differently,
		    feeling differently.

		    Interesting. Would you like to be

</b>		    Lots of things. He's very well

		    all sorts of philosophical questions
		    about the nature of self, about the

		    Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha
		    right, is duality an illusion? Do
		    you see what a can of worms this

<b>				 MAXINE
</b>		    Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going

</b>		    Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging

</b>		    After that I'll introduce you to my

<b>				 MAXINE
</b>			    (to no one in particular)

		    want, may not get what they want, but
		    they remain vital, in touch with
		    themselves, and when they lie on
		    their deathbeds, they have few
		    regrets. The ones who don't go
		    after what they want... well, who

	Maxine laughs. There is another silence. Suddenly, at the
	same moment, both Craig and Lotte lunge for Maxine and
	start kissing her passionately about the face and neck.
	They stop just as suddenly and look at each other.

</b>		    You?

	Lotte looks away.

<b>				 MAXINE
</b>		    Craig, I just don't find you

	screams. Craig holds the gun to her head.

	She shuts up. Keeping the gun trained on Lotte, Craig
	dials the phone. He hands the receiver to her. He holds his

	Malkovich and Maxine lie naked on the bed, looking quite
	relaxed.

<b>				 MAXINE
</b>		    You still there, sweets?

<b>				 MALKOVICH
</b>		    Yeah. I've figured out how to hold
		    on as long as I want. Oddly enough,
		    it's all in the wrists.

<b>				 MAXINE
</b>		    Wow.
			    (little girl pout)
		    Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.

<b>				 MALKOVICH
</b>		    You mean with Malkovich?

<b>				 MAXINE
</b>		    I'd love to see your work.

<b>				 MALKOVICH
</b>			    (pleased)
		    Really? Yeah. Okay.

	Malkovich leans over and kisses her, then gets up.

<b>				 MALKOVICH (CONT'D)
</b>		    I'll do something I call "Craig's
		    Dance of Despair and Disillusionment."

	Malkovich performs the same dance that the Craig pupper
	did at the beginning of the film. It is exactly the same,
	complete with impossible somersaults and perspiring brow.
	He finishes by falling to his knees and weeping.

<b>				 MAXINE
</b>			    (moved)
		    That was incredible. You're brilliant!

<b>				 MALKOVICH
</b>		    You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing
		    with dolls.

<b>				 MAXINE
</b>		    You're right, my darling, it's
		    so much more. It's playing with
		    people!

	Malkovich kisses Maxine. She snuggles close to him.

<b>				 MAXINE
</b>		    Stay in him forever?

<b>				 MALKOVICH
</b>			    (as Malkovich, screaming)
		    No!
			    (as Craig, calmly)
		    But how will we make a living,
		    my love, if our clientele doesn't
		    have access to our product?

<b>				 MAXINE
</b>		    Well, we'll have all the money in
		    Malkovich's bank account, plus he
		    still gets acting work occasionally.

<b>				 MALKOVICH
</b>			    (as Malkovich, breaking through)
		    No! Please!
			    (as Craig, to Malkovich)
		    Shut up, will you? We're trying to
		    think here.
			    (to Maxine)
		    It is sort of like being a puppeteer.
		    I like that about it.

<b>				 MAXINE
</b>		    No one would ever have to know its
		    not him.

<b>				 MALKOVICH
</b>			    (an idea)
		    Wait a minute! What if everybody knew?
		    What if we presented Malkovich as the
		    world's most complicated puppet and
		    me as the only puppeteer sophisticated
		    enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor

	Maxine and Malkovich are furiously filling the portal

		    It's okay, my sweet.

	They go back to filling the portal. There is the sound
	of many shuffling feet in the hallway. The door flies
	open and the Malkovichians led by Lester and Lotte burst
	in. Malkovich and Maxine turn with a start.

<b>				 LESTER
</b>		    Aaaahhhh, the portal!

<b>				 LOTTE
</b>			    (to Malkovich)
		    You bastard!

	Lotte lunges for Malkovich. Lester grabs her arm, holds

<b>				 LESTER
</b>		    No! Don't harm the vessel!

<b>				 LOTTE
</b>		    It's Craig in there, I can tell.

<b>				 LESTER
</b>		    I understand, but we must protect

		    Please, Craig, please step aside

<b>				 CRAIG
</b>		    Squatter's rights, Lester.

	Craig laughs somewhat maniacally. Maxine slips her arm
	through Craig's, joins him in his laughter, and glances
	triumphantly over at Lotte.

<b>				 MAXINE
</b>		    Now excuse us, we have an
		    entertainment legend to create.

<b>				 LESTER
</b>			    (to the cult members)
		    Clear the way for them, my friends.

	The Malkovichians grumble and let Malkovich and Maxine
	exit.

<b>				 LESTER (CONT'D)
</b>		    Now, let's see what we can do to

	The Malkovichians converge on the sealed portal, and
	begin clawing desperately at the quick-drying cement.
	Fingers are scraped raw, and we see smears of blood and
	skin on the rough gray surface.

<b>				 LESTER
</b>		    Thank you all for your efforts,

		    into Malkovich through the portal.

<b>				 LOTTE
</b>			    (panicky)
		    Why not? I need to get in there!

<b>				 LESTER
</b>		    I'm not certain, my dear, but I
		    believe your husband has somehow
		    psychically diverted the route.

<b>				 LOTTE
</b>		    That bastard! I'll gladly dispose

<b>				 LESTER
</b>		    I'm afraid that no physical harm

</b>		    Actually, my friends, I suppose its

		    Mertin.

	The members fall into a stunned silence. Lester takes
	some refrigerator magnets and spells out L-E-S-T-E-R on
	a board. He then rearranges them for a while.

<b>				 LESTER (CONT'D)
</b>		    You see, Lester is an anagram for
		    Mertin.

	Lester continues to rearrange the letters, getting a little
	tense now.

<b>				 LESTER (CONT'D)
</b>		    It used to work, I'm sure of it.

	Several members check their watches.

<b>				 LESTER (CONT'D)
</b>		    Oh, damn it to hell. Anyway, I am.

	L-E-S-T-E-R has been left as E-L R-E-S-T as Lester turns
	from the board to face the congregation.

	There is a lot of murmuring in the room now.

</b>		    So what exactly are you saying? Are

		    here?

<b>				 LESTER
</b>		    Surprise.

	The cultists get tense, start to leave en masse.

<b>				 LESTER (CONT'D)
</b>		    Wait! It's not that bad! When we get
		    into Malkovich, we still get to rule
		    the world, just like I told you. The 
		    only difference is that we rule in the
		    name of evil, instead of good.

	People stop in their tracks.

<b>				 MAN #3
</b>		    That's the only difference?

<b>				 LESTER
</b>		    Absolutely.

	The cultists think about is, then shrug and stay put.

<b>				 LESTER (CONT'D)
</b>		    So anyway...

	Lotte stands.

<b>				 LOTTE
</b>		    Well, I for one, am resigning. I will

	Lotte heads for the door.

<b>				 LESTER
</b>		    My dear, let me assure you that when

	Lotte stops and turns.

<b>				 FLEMMER
</b>		    Right, Lester. I heard you the first

<b>				 FLEMMER
</b>		    Look, I'm going back to my house

	The orchestra starts up. The curtains part.

<b>				 LESTER

	Malkovich tap dances out onto the stage. He is amazingly
	nimble and the audience "oohs" and "aahs."

<b>				 LESTER (CONT'D)
</b>			    (grudgingly)
		    Pretty good though.

	Malkovich does an amazing triple somersault, lands on one
	knee and, with spread arms, begins singing: "Kiss Today
	Goodbye."  in a beautiful tenor. The orchestra catches up
	with him. The audience goes wild. A pretty-boy young man
	with a big tousle of black hair and a shiny, tight suit
	appears at the back of the house. An usher glances over at
	him.

<b>				 USHER
</b>		    Oh, Mr. Mantini! We weren't expecting

		    Make one empty.

<b>				 USHER
</b>		    Y-y-y-es sir.

	The usher looks nervously around for someone to boot.
	Martini waits in the back. On stage, Malkovich is now
	performing the "back of the car scene" from "On The
	Waterfront."  He alternates between the Marlon Brando part
	and the Rod Steiger part, moving back and forth from one
	stool to the another. He performs it magnificently. We see
	Lester in the audience wiping a small tear from his eye.

<b>				 LESTER
</b>		    Not too shabby.

	Mantini is now sitting in a good aisle seat next to a 
	beautiful woman. Her boyfriend is being hauled toward the
	exit by the usher. The beautiful woman watches, with some
	concern, as the boyfriend is taken away. Then she turns and
	smiles flirtatiously at Mantini. Mantini smiles back. On
	stage Malkovich is dressed in a ringmaster's outfit and
	juggling chainsaws.

<b>				 MANTINI
</b>		    Nothing more than a Goddamn clown.

	and sits down next to her.

<b>				 LOTTE
</b>		    They're going to take over the

</b>		    Yeah what?!

<b>				 MALKOVICH
</b>		    Derek Mantini!

	Mantini enters. Maxine is suddenly interested. Mantini and
	Maxine give each other the once over.

<b>				 MANTINI
</b>			    (still eyeing Maxine)
		    Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.

<b>				 MALKOVICH
</b>		    Did you see the reviews?

<b>				 MANTINI
</b>		    Yeah, I saw them

<b>				 MALKOVICH
</b>		    Because if you missed any, I just
		    happen to have copies here you can
		    take with you when you leave now.

<b>				 MAXINE
</b>		    I'm Maxine. I produced the evening
		    with Malkovich.

<b>				 MANTINI
</b>		    Very impressive. I could use a
		    producer with your vision. And
		    other outstanding attributes.

<b>				 MALKOVICH
</b>		    She's not available.

<b>				 MANTINI
</b>		    We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.

<b>				 MAXINE
</b>		    Yeah, we'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.

<b>				 MANTINI
</b>		    I won't waste your time Schwartz, or
		    more importantly, mine. Here's my
		    proposal: There's only room in this
		    world for one "World's Greatest
		    Puppeteer."  Correct? So let's allow
		    the puppet-going public to crown
		    their king.

<b>				 MALKOVICH
</b>		    How do we do that?

<b>				 MANTINI
</b>		    A friendly competition, if you will.
		    Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S.
		    Truman puppet appear opposite each
		    other in a play. Not some Vegas
		    Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play
		    that requires actual acting. The
		    audience decides who is more deserving
		    of the title. The losing puppeteer
		    bows out graciously. Goes back to
		    obscurity as a file clerk.

<b>				 MALKOVICH
</b>		    What's the play?

<b>				 MANTINI
</b>		    Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.

<b>				 MALKOVICH
</b>		    Never heard of it.

<b>				 MANTINI
</b>		    Broadway's finest three hours. It's
		    about the suppression of the
		    individual. Conformity as God in
		    modern society.

<b>				 MALKOVICH
</b>		    Sounds boring. Are there any songs?

<b>				 MANTINI
</b>		    Nothing but acting to hide behind,
		    buddy-boy.

<b>				 MALKOVICH
</b>		    I'm not afraid. I toured for a year
		    with the National Puppet Company's
		    production of "Long Day's Journey
		    Into Night."

<b>				 MANTINI
</b>		    Great then.

<b>				 MALKOVICH
</b>		    Is there dancing?

<b>				 MANTINI
</b>		    No.

</b>		    I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me

<b>				 FLEMMER
</b>		    Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will
		    leave Malkovich, right? So, if he
		    needs it, I help Mantini's performance
		    a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the
		    show.

<b>				 LESTER
</b>		    Can you do that? I mean, do you know

</b>		    I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can

	Malkovich has upPed his convulsions now. He watches Truman
	out of the corner of his eye while writhing tormentedly on
	the bench. He levitates. Spins in mid-air. Falls on all
	fours and does an uncanny impression of a yelping dog.
	Truman watches Malkovich, continues to speak. But now, when
	he talks, fire comes out of his mouth.

	in awe. Malkovich sighs. He is out of his league. He goes
	into a remarkable tap dance routine and sings "Mr.
	Bojangles", but nobody even looks at the stage. The giant
	swan bursts into flames, flies back onto the stage, burns
	to a crisp, then rises from his ashes as the actual Harry S.

	raised from the dead.

	There is no noise whatsoever. There are several movie
	theaters on the block. All marquees advertise John Malkovich
	movies. Around the corner comes Malkovich. He is floating
	about ten feet off the ground on an enormous, bright red,
	jeweled throne. He wears a gold crown and purple silk robe
	and smiles condescendingly, majestically. Floris sits on his

		    Also, I think, you know, if you

	marionette being controlled from above by an emotionless
	Mantini in a gray jumpsuit.

<b>				 MANTINI
</b>			    (in Craig's voice)
		    I can't wait to see where you and your
		    friends live, Lotte.

<b>				 LOTTE (O.S.)
</b>		    It's beautiful, Craig, like Eden.

	Now we see filaments attached to Mantini's arms, and w
	follow them up to find that Flemmer is controlling Mantini.

<b>				 FLEMMER
</b>		    One serpent, coming up.

	Flemmer throws his head back and laughs. The camera moves
	into his mouth and down his throat, which, oddly enough,
	looks exactly like the membranous John Malkovich portal
	tunnel.

	MUSIC IN: "Put Your Hand Inside The Puppet Head" by They
	Might Be Giants. It plays throughout the credits.

<b>	FADE OUT
</b>


<b>	THE END
