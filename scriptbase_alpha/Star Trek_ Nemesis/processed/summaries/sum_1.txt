On their way to Riker's and Troi's honeymoon, the Enterprise is sent near the Neutral Zone to Romulan space, and picks up a prototypic twin of android Data.
Immediately, they are further sent to Romulus, where a new Praetor, Shinzon, a human cloned from Captain Picard who lives on the slave planet Remus, appears to want peace with the Federation.
But then the crew detects a break-in on their computer systems, and Picard is captured by the Remans because Shinzon needs him as his only matching supplier of genetic material.
Picard and the Enterprise can escape, only to find themselves battling Shinzon's completely cloaked Warbird, who is after the complete destruction of Earth.
