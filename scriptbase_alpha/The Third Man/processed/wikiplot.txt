American pulp Western writer Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) arrives in Allied-occupied Vienna seeking his childhood friend, Harry Lime (Orson Welles), who has offered him a job.
Martins discovers that Lime was killed by a car while crossing the street just days before.
At Lime's funeral, Martins meets two British Army Police: Sergeant Paine (Bernard Lee), a fan of Martins' pulp fiction, and his superior, Major Calloway (Trevor Howard).
Afterward, Martins is asked to give a lecture to a book club a few days later.
He then meets a friend of Lime's, "Baron" Kurtz (Ernst Deutsch), who tells Martins that he and another friend, Popescu (Siegfried Breuer), carried Lime to the side of the street after the accident and, before he died, Lime asked them to take care of Martins and Lime's actress girlfriend, Anna Schmidt (Alida Valli).

Martins goes to see Anna and becomes suspicious that the facts 'don't add up' and that Lime's death was not an accident.
The porter at Lime's apartment building says that Lime was killed immediately and that three men carried the body, not two.
Martins and Anna discover that the police are searching her flat; the police confiscate her forged passport and detain her.
The next evening Martins visits Lime's "medical adviser", Dr. Winkel (Erich Ponto), who says that he arrived at the accident after Lime was dead, and only two men were there.

The porter offers to give Martins more information, but he is murdered before Martins can see him.
When Martins arrives, the crowd believe this stranger is involved and become hostile.
Escaping from them, Martins returns to the hotel, and a cab immediately takes him to the book club, where he makes a poor speech.
When Popescu enters, he asks about Martins' next book.
Martins says that it will be called The Third Man, "a murder story" inspired by facts.
Popescu tells Martins that he should stick to fiction.
Martins sees two thugs advancing towards him and flees.
