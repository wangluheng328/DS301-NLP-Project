Toy Story is about the 'secret life of toys' when people are not around.
When Buzz Lightyear, a space-ranger, takes Woody's place as Andy's favorite toy, Woody doesn't like the situation and gets into a fight with Buzz.
Accidentaly Buzz falls out the window and Woody is accused by all the other toys of having killed him.
He has to go out of the house to look for him so that they can both return to Andys room.
But while on the outside they get into all kind of trouble while trying to get home.
