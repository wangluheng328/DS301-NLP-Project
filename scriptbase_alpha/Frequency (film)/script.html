            The Child is the Father of the Man.

                              - William Wordsworth

            ...the theory of black holes was developed before there was
            any indication from observations that they actually existed.
            I do not know of any other example in science where such a
            great extrapolation was successfully made solely on the basis
            of thought.  It shows the remarkable power and depth of
            Einstein's theory.  There is still much we don't know, such
            as what happens to objects and information that fall into a
            black hole.  Do the reemerge elsewhere in the Universe, or in
            another universe?  And can we warp space and time so much
            that one can travel back in time?  Maybe someone will come
            back from the future and tell us.

                              - Stephen Hawking

<b>            FADE IN:
</b>
            The legend reads: OCTOBER 10th

<b>            EXT. MANHATTAN BRIDGE - PREDAWN - 1969
</b>
            Darkness.  Headlights bounce off thick sheets of RAIN.  6,500
            gallon Esso OIL TRUCK barrels over wet studded pavement,
            heading towards Manhattan.  It's going fast.  Too fast.

            Up ahead...at the BASE OF THE BRIDGE:

            A large reflective sign - lit up by arc lights: MEN AT WORK.

            There are TWO WORK CREWS, several hundred feet apart.

            THE FIRST CREW is CON ED.  A corrugated vacuum tube feeds
            into an open MANHOLE.  A WORKER drops into the hole.

            THE SECOND CREW is CONSTRUCTION.  They're at the apron of the
            bridge securing lumber supports for the roadbed.

            It's late and the men are tired.  A mistake is made.  A FORK
            LIFT loaded with LUMBER fails to negotiate a turn...whacks
            into an abutment... spilling its load onto the roadway.

            Bad timing, because right now that Esso OIL TRUCK hits the
            OFF RAMP.  Not a lot of time for the driver to react to a
            roadway spewed with lumber.

            He does his best.  Slams the brakes, spins the wheel, hits
            the horn, but it doesn't matter: 18 wheels skid across the
            blacktop - spitting thick smoke and burnt rubber, lifting off
            the slick pavement...twisting...flipping...hemorrhaging oil
            from its ruptured tanks...grinding its way towards...

            MEN AT WORK.  Seconds to react as an 80,000 pound juggernaut
            of death plows through parked cars like paper...crushing the
            Con Ed equipment...lurching to a halt on top of the MANHOLE.

<b>            EXT. FIRE STATION - 9TH BATTALION - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            TWO FIRE TRUCKS (1000 Gallon Pumper and Mack Tiller Ladder)
            pull into the street.

<b>            EXT. LADDER TRUCK JUMPER SEATS - MOVING - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            SIRENS wail, cherry tops spin.

            FRANK SULLIVAN, 40, is strapped into an open-air jumper seat.
            A real life hard charger, Frank is the kind of iron's man
            fire fighters want coming in after them, should they get
            caught in harm's way.  Kind-hearted and hard-fisted, he has
            the grace and courage of a man living by his convictions.

            Across from Frank sits GRAHAM GIBSON, 20.  A good-looking
            African-American, "Gib" is a Fire Fighter Fourth Grade, a
            tank man... and one nervous probie.

            Through a window into the CAB, we SEE LT. BUTCH FOSTER, 50,
            on a walkie-talkie.  A beefy old pro who's been through more
            fires than he can remember.

            A walkie-talkie sits in a cradle between Frank and Gibson.

<b>                                BUTCH'S VOICE
</b>                          (through walkie-talkie)
                      ...oil all over the street.  Cracked
                      water and gas mains.  Four companies
                      coming in...

            Butch's voice continues as Frank calmly absorbs the
            information, while at the same time.

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                          (re: rain)
                      Oh, man.  Hope it ain't like this in
                      Baltimore tomorrow.

<b>                                GIBSON
</b>                      Baltimore?

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                      The game, Graham.  The Series?

            Gibson taps his wristwatch.

<b>                                GIBSON
</b>                      Oh, yeah.  Damn.  My watch is busted.

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                      Hey, Rookie.  Be cool.  Just stay with
                      me.  This is what we do.

<b>                                GIBSON
</b>                          (still tapping his watch)
                      I seem nervous, huh?

            Frank laughs.  Gibson grins, relaxes a bit.  Frank checks his
            ROLEX DIVER'S WATCH.  Multiple SIRENS fill the dawn.

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                      It's 5:30, Gib.

<b>                                BUTCH'S VOICE
</b>                          (through walkie talkie)
                      ...two Con Ed men trapped in an
                      underground electrical conductor vault.

            Frank's eyes harden.  His game face sets up.

<b>            EXT. MANHATTAN BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            A tableau of impending danger.  Thick black OIL bleeds from
            teh truck onto the street...pouring underneath the rig...and
            into the MANHOLE.

            POLICE urgently cordon off the area, evacuating the workers.
            EMERGENCY PERSONNEL deal with the badly injured TRUCK DRIVER.

            Firemen wedge sandbags between the hull of the truck and the
            three-quarters covered manhole -- trying to divert the oil
            away from the underground vault.

            FIRE COMMANDER O'CONNELL yells at his men to finish the job
            and get the hell away.

            The BIG TRUCKS ARRIVE.  PUMPER ENGINE and Frank's LADDER
            TRUCK -- rapidly guided into position by men on the ground.

            Frank, Gibson, Butch and the rest of the unit are on the
            ground instantly and ready for orders.  They are looking at a
            nightmare ready to happen.  Frank takes in everything.

            FIRE COMMANDER O'CONNELL and a CON ED SUPERVISOR approach.

<b>                                BUTCH
</b>                          (deep irony)
                      A fun one.

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                      Yep.

<b>                                COMMANDER
</b>                      We got high voltage cables ripped loose
                      in the underground.  They hit water, that
                      fault's gonna arc.

            Frank looks at the tanker over the manhole.  There is now
            nobody around it.

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                      Why haven't they killed the juice?

<b>                                SUPERVISOR

<b>                                SUPERVISOR
</b>                      Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system
                      down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna
                      take awhile.

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                      We gotta go underground.  Get those guys
                      out, now.

<b>                                SUPERVISOR
</b>                      We tried.  Bulkhead door's rusted shut.
                      Won't budge.

<b>                                COMMANDER
</b>                      The block is being evacuated.  I don't
                      want anybody... including our
                      boys...within fifty yards of that
                      tanker...it's a fucking bomb.

            Frank has been staring at the capsized rig.

            Butch knows what he's thinking.  But it's too late.  Frank is
            gone...slogging through the oozing oil to the hull of the
            tanker.  He kneels over the three-quarters covered manhole,
            using a flashlight to peer into the darkness below.  Sparks
            from the loose cables spit off flashes of light as the cables
            hiss and slap against the ceiling and walls of the vault.

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                      This is the Fire Department.  Frank

            And Frank is up, heading for his truck, signaling Gibson.

                      men in time.

            Frank grabs a "halaghan claw tool" and a walkie-talkie.
            Gibson nervously picks out two helmet lights...and they are
            off and running.

<b>            EXT. MANHOLE - CANAL &amp; BOWERY - CONTINUOUS

            Frank uses the "adz" to rip open the heavy manhole cover.

<b>            INT. MANHOLE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Frank and Gibson descend into the tunnel, strap lights on
            their leather helmets to illuminate the damp darkness.  They
            race down the subterranean passage.  The stench is thick.
            Butch's voice suddenly booms out of the walkie-talkie:

                      flashover.  I want you to abort!  Now!
                      Get the hell out of there!

            Frank picks up the pace.  Charges ahead.  Guy's got balls.

                      I should'a been a fucking mailman.

            Frank reaches the rusted 'submarine-like' VAULT DOOR.  Pounds
            on the door... a faint response.  He goes to work on it with
            the halaghan tool.  Gibson arrives...pretty rattled.  Frank
            gives him a wink and a smile.  It's gonna be okay.

                      Frank, where are you?

            Frank digs down, suddenly the DOOR GIVES WAY

            Oil and water rush from the VAULT, pouring over Frank and
            Gibson, foaming into the tunnel.  But the door is mounted
            three feet off the ground.  There is still three feet of oil
            and water trapped inside.  And the smell of gas is now
            overwhelming...

                      We're in, Butch.

            Frank probes the dark vault with the FLASHLIGHT BLADE.
            Through smoke we see TWO MEN huddled in the corner, trapped
            by three loose 'HOT' CABLES - WHIPPING AROUND THE TINY VAULT
            LIKE AN ELECTRIC HYDRA.  Con Ed Worker #2 shivers, ankle
            broken, leaning on older Con Ed Worker #1.

<b>                                FRANK (CONT'D)
</b>                      Time to go home, fellas.

            Gibson sprays the room, clearing out most of the smoke.
            Frank steps into the vault.

<b>                                CON ED WORKER #1
</b>                      Careful.  If the hot end of those cables
                      hits you, it'll conduct to the water and
                      we're all fired.

            Frank drops to his knees, ducking under the cables, shuffles
            to center of the vault.  Places his hands at opposite ends of
            the halaghan tool, hoping for the cables to pass directly
            over his head.  A hairy beat, then...

            Frank jackknifes out of the water, ramming the halaghan into
            the ceiling.  It worked.  The teeth on the "claw-end" and the
            spike on the "adz-end" are embedded into the concrete --
            STAPLING THE CABLES TO THE CEILING.  Make that balls of
            steel.

            Gibson and Con Ed worker #1 help injured Worker #2 out of the
            vault.  Frank checks to make sure they've cleared the vault
            and lets go of the tool.

            Frank jumps into the tunnel, hoists the injured worker over
            his back and races back down the tunnel.

<b>            INT./EXT. MANHOLE - CANAL &amp; BOWERY - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Frank, Gibson and the Con Ed men scramble towards the
            manhole.  Butch and another fireman are waiting up top.  They
            help the men -- who are covered in oil and slime -- up onto
            the street.  And then they all tear away from the
            manhole...around a corner... collapsing on the pavement
            against a building.

<b>            K-A-B-O-O-M -- A MUFFLED EXPLOSION

            The vault ignites, the tunnel "FLASHBACKS" -- a towering
            geyser of FLAMES AND DIRT ERUPTING out of the manhole from
            which Frank has just escaped.

            In the distance, FLAMES erupt out of the other
            manhole...engulfing the OIL TRUCK...blowing it into a million
            pieces.

            Through the INFERNO at the base of the Manhattan Bridge,
            Frank can see that no one is hurt.  His eyes glistening with
            adrenaline and relief, he sits back against the building and
            throws an arm around Gibson.

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                      You did good, Gib.  Real good.

            Frank looks over at the hyperventilating Butch and smiles.

            Inside the tunnel.  Dark.  Moving fast.  Flashes of LIGHT
            bounce off the shiny tile walls.  The deep throated ROAR of a
            '67 HARLEY battles with Martha &amp; the Vandellas' HEAT WAVE.
            We are with Frank, wearing a leather jacket with the insignia
            of his fire-fighting unit emblazoned on it, and a New York
            Mets BASEBALL CAP pulled down tight, as he rockets his
            chopper through traffic, out of the tunnel, and up into...

<b>            EXT. QUEENS - STREETS - CONTINUOUS

            CREDIT MONTAGE begins as Frank cruises home.  It has STOPPED
            RAINING.  Frank passes by billboards and other evidence of
            the approaching METS/BALTIMORE ORIOLES World Series.

            He circles a LITTLE LEAGUE ball field waving to some

</b>
<b>            EXT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - QUEENS - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Frank glides the Harley alongside his house.  A feisty
            DALMATIAN PUPPY ELVIS barks his welcome from behind a fence.

            Feeling fatigued, Frank dismounts and enters teh backyard,
            playing for a moment with Elvis while he uprights a TRAINING
            BICYCLE, tidies up BASEBALL EQUIPMENT, and glances up at a
            HAM RADIO ANTENNA secured to the roof, before entering
            through a backdoor.  There is a sense of routine to all this.

<b>            INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

            The kitchen is empty.  Breakfast dishes in the sink.  Frank
            flips on the RADIO.  It plays out under the rest of the
            MONTAGE as coverage of the oil truck crash blends into other
            news stories.

            A note on the refrigerator reads: 8:15.  Hey, Bud.  I'm off
            to work. Johnny's at school.  Elvis is fed.  I luvs you.

            Setting a grapefruit and a slice of toast on the table, Frank
            glances at the Daily News.  But his eyes are tired, he stares
            off into space...letting go.

<b>            INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - MASTER BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

            A radio in the bedroom is tuned to sports news.  Frank soaks
            in a hot bath.  He looks like he might fall asleep - and
            does.

            CRASH!  A SOFTBALL BLOWS through the window from the
            BACKYARD, landing on the rug next to the bed.  Frank bolts
            awake, staring at the busted window.

            He checks the clock.  It is 5:15.  He steps to the broken
            window.  SEVERAL SMALL BOYS scurry from the yard.  Two
            others, JOHNNY SULLIVAN and GORDO HERSCH, both 6, stand
            frozen in place.  Elvis tears in circles around them.  All is
            very quiet.  Then, from somewhere beyond the bedroom door, we
            HEAR The Beatles' BACK IN THE THE USSR...

            JULIA SULLIVAN, 32, is rockin' out, chopping vegetables.

            eyes, soft earthy vibe.  A beauty.

            Frank, wearing FDNY sweats, moves into the kitchen flipping
            the softball from hand to hand.  Julia turns to him and rolls
            her eyes at the sight of the ball.  Say no more.

            Without breaking stride, he gives her a smack on the lips and
            steps to the screen door to the back porch.

<b>            EXT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

            Johnny stands nervously outside the door.  Elvis sits at his
            side.  Gordo watches from the safety of his own porch next
            door.  Frank opens the screen door, casts a stern look down
            at his son.

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                      Glad to hear that.

            And Frank drops the softball into Johnny's mitt, closes the
            screen door and turns back into the kitchen.  Johnny turns
            away into the yard.

            With a shrug, and sharing a kids will be kids smile with

            Julia crosses her eyes, as if she could stop him.  Frank
            moves to change records.

            Suddenly, a PAN of spaghetti sauce bubbles over.

            Johnny takes a gulp of air, doesn't want to disappoint his
            father, nods okay.

            He starts pedaling.  Slowly moving forward.  Frank holds on
            to the seat.  Frank's still hanging on - jogging along side.

            Frank let's go.  Johnny's pumping those little six year-old
            legs, but he starts to wobble out of control -- CRASH!

            Johnny starts to cry, quickly gets up and runs back to the
            house.  Julia comes out of the kitchen door.  Johnny runs
            into her arms.

            Johnny tears himself from Julia's arms, runs inside.
            Frustrated, Frank lights up another cigarette.

                      behind him.

            Frank takes a deep drag on the butt.  Steps onto the YARD and

            And then to a photo of him and Sam at a CARNIVAL SHOOTING

            BRRIING.  John grabs the phone.

            BANG.  Slams down the phone.  And stares around the room.

            WE'VE BEEN IN THIS HOUSE BEFORE -- 29 YEARS AGO.  This was
            Frank and Julia sullivan's house.  Time has not been good to
            it.  Furnishings haven't changed much, but the house is
            missing the warmth it had when a family filled it with love.

            John's eyes dart to a PHOTOGRAPH next to the desk.  It is a
            picture of THE SULLIVAN FAMILY from back then.  Too many
            memories.  He grabs his coat, heads out...

<b>            EXT. LITTLE LEAGUE BASEBALL FIELD - QUEENS - EVENING

            The field is EMPTY.  Covered in shadows.  John sits alone on
            the top row of the BLEACHERS, cradling his bottle of
            BUSHMILLS.  He takes a long pull.  As he stares down at the
            empty field, his eyes slowly drift over to home plate...

            AUDIO FLASHBACK: a VOICE rises up out of the darkness.  The

            thousand yard stare.

            Gordy Jr. reaches in and takes out: FDNY HELMET &amp; JACKETS.
            Briefly puts on the enormous helmet, then sets it aside.

            Reaches back into the trunk and pulls out the disassembled

<b>                                JOHN
</b>                      Ellen.

            Ellen notices John's weary look but says nothing.  We get the
            sense she knows what is wrong.

<b>                                ELLEN
</b>                      C'mon Gordy, let's go.

<b>                                GORDY JR.
</b>                      Oh, mom...

<b>            EXT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Gordo and family pour into the yard between the two houses.
            John shuffles out behind them.  Gordo and Gordy Jr. quickly
            disappear into their house, but Ellen lingers for a moment -
            looking back at John standing alone.

<b>                                ELLEN
</b>                      You all right, John?

<b>                                JOHN
</b>                      Oh, yeah.

            Ellen holds her glance for a moment.   John smiles, thinly
            masking his sadness.  Ellen nods okay, and she is gone.  John
            looks up at the stars, then down to the HAM RADIO ANTENNA on
            his roof, now looking raggedy from 29 years of neglect.

            TV: LARRY KING is interviewing STEPHEN HAWKING.

            John is back on the Bushmills.  He races clumsily for the
            CORDLESS PHONE.  CLOSE ON SPEED DIAL BUTTONS.  John hits #3.

                      Hi, this is Julia.  Please leave a

                      at work.  Anyways, I'll see you tomorrow
                      night.  Love you.

            John puts down the phone.  Stares at the FDNY trunk.  He
            stumbles to it.  Sits down and opens it up.  It's filled with
            his Dad's stuff.  He picks up and leafs through the old
            SCRAPBOOK - PHOTOS and CLIPPINGS illustrate FAMILY HISTORY...

            A quick glimpse of Dad's high school baseball team; Mom and
            Dad's 60's wedding.

            A folded newspaper drops out.  John picks it up.  Front page
            of the DAILY NEWS.  Top half READS: "October 13, 1969.

</b>
            He shoves the paper back in the scrapbook.  Puts the album
            down - he can't deal with those wounds.  He glances up at the
<b>            TV:
</b>
<b>                                LARRY KING
</b>                      Is this anomaly connected to the space
                      storm and the NASA satellite that
                      disappeared in 1969?

<b>                                HAWKING
</b>                      We don't know.  But given the
                      similarities of their location and
                      appearance, this is a question that
                      merits further investigation.

            NOTE:  Larry King's show plays for the duration of this
            scene.

            John settles in, takes off his work shirt.  Underneath he has
            on a T-shirt.  We notice a NICOTINE PATCH on his arm.
            Doesn't stop him from burning another Marlboro.

            Approaching the desk, John sits down at the radio.  Reaches

            In the BACKGROUND of FRANK'S VOICE, we barely hear WALTER
            CRONKITE interviewing someone.

            A pause.

</b>                      I thought these things were for talkin'

                      these things.

            As John releases the squawk bar, the distant sound of Frank's
            TV filters out of the HAM.

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                      Can you hold on a second?

            And then John hears the sound of a door closing.

<b>                                FRANK (CONT'D)
</b>                      Sorry 'bout that.  So Queens, you psyched

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                      Fed up?  Lemme tell you something, in a

                      America, they're gonna learn about three
                      things: the Constitution, Rock 'n' Roll,
                      and Baseball.

            Despite his mood, John has to smile.

<b>                                FRANK (CONT'D)
</b>                      How can you live in Queens and not love
                      the Amazin's?

            John warms to the topic of his boyhood heroes.

<b>                                JOHN
</b>                      If you're talking The Amazin' Mets, well,
                      that's different.  You know people talk
                      about Seaver, but I'll love Ron Swoboda
                      til the day I die.

            Static crackles out over the radio.  The signal weakens.

                      heart of a lion.  Hey, how 'bout the

<b>                                JOHN
</b>                      Yeah.  It was all over after Buford
                      nailed Seaver's first pitch outta the
                      park.

            BZZZSSSSHHHH - loud static.  THE SIGNAL IS GONE.

            Behind him, on TV, Larry King and Hawking continue talking.

            Silence.  The signal is gone.  Frank leans forward, jiggles
            the frequency dial, trying to regain the signal.  No luck.

            Slightly frustrated, he stands and opens the glass doors to
            the family room where Julia is watching TV - a very young
            STEPHEN HAWKING is being interviewed by WALTER CRONKITE, 52.

                      Sure.

            He starts to take a step into the room, and stumbles over
            Elvis, sleeping by the door...KNOCKING INTO and CRACKING a
            GLASS PANE in one door.

            John, dog tired and more than a little wasted, gets up from
            the desk, inadvertently leaving the Ham Radio ON, and
            shuffles for the family room through the glass doors.

            CAMERA HOLDS, CLOSE on the GLASS PANE...CRACKED in the exact

            The LEGEND reads:

            OCTOBER 11th - FIRST GAME OF THE WORLD SERIES

            Blue sky.  A SOFTBALL soars into view.  It drops down and
            into a WILLIE MAYS' style basket catch by Frank Sullivan.

<b>            EXT. LITTLE LEAGUE BASEBALL FIELD - QUEENS - DAY - 1969
</b>
            The same Little League field that Frank circled on his Harley
            yesterday, October 10, 1969.  And the same field at which
            John sat in the stands drinking last night, October 10, 1998.

            We are in the 9th inning of a friendly SOFTBALL GAME between
            the local COPS and FIREMEN.  A lot of NYPD and FDNY T-shirts,
            sweats and caps.  Plenty of Mets stuff, too.

            Having made the catch, Frank coolly pulls the ball from his
            mitt as he starts running toward the infield diamond.
            Tagging up at 3rd, sorely tempted to try for home is SATCH
            DELEON, 30, NYPD Detective.  Satch feints for the plate,
            Frank feints the throw.  For a maddening, gleeful moment,
            Frank has Satch caught between 3rd and home.

            In the STANDS, Johnny Sullivan, Marge Hersch and the FAMILIES
            of the other ballplayers scream for whomever they want to win
            this game of chicken.

            On the SIDELINES, Johnny, Gordo and the other KIDS serving as
            BATBOYS and WATERBOYS, jump around in anticipation.

            At HOME, Butch Foster stations himself to take the throw.

            Suddenly, Satch fakes to 3rd, then bolts for home.  Frank
            pegs it to Butch, who tags the sliding Satch.  Game over.

<b>                                SATCH
</b>                      Lucky throw, fire boy.

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                          (jogging in)
                      Luck, my ass.

            They square off.  Pretending to fight.  Julia steps between
            them.  And they all descend into laughter.

            Frank and Satch each wrap an arm around Julia and start off.
            Within a step, Johnny slips in under Frank's other arm.

<b>                                FRANK (CONT'D)

            REVERSE to see many of the PLAYERS and FAMILIES from teh

            game.  BEER flows from a keg.  SOFT DRINKS are passed around.
            HAMBURGERS and HOT DOGS are cooking on the BBQ.

            Satch sits with Johnny and Gordo and some other kids.

            Frank and Julia tend the BBQ.  Butch brings out some beers.
            A fun day.

<b>            EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY - 1998

            A DETECTIVE'S CAR pulls up next to a couple of BLUE &amp; WHITES
            at West 155th St.  The Northern tip of Manhattan Island.

            Across construction barricades is a half-torn down GREEK
            RESTAURANT.  Several UNIFORMS can be seen beyond it, looking
            at something on the ground.

            As John exits the car, the passenger door swings open and we
            MEET a guy we haven't seen in 29 YEARS - SATCHEL DELEON, 59.
            Shaved head, square jaw.  A ram-rod straight, craggy warrior.
            Thirty-plus years on the force now endow him with a rare
            combination of smarts, guts and sense of humor.

<b>                                SATCH

            Spotting John and Satch, a UNIFORM approaches them.  They
            keep on walking.

<b>                                JOHN
</b>                      What's the story?

<b>                                UNIFORM
</b>                      Survey crew found a body.  Actually a
                      skeleton.  Over here.

            The uniform leads John and Satch around some overgrown weeds
            to SEE a patch of freshly unearthed dirt...out of which
            sticks a HUMAN SKULL and COLLAR BONE.

            In the B.G., a CRIME SCENE unit can be seen arriving by van.

<b>                                SATCH
</b>                      Be real careful when pulling it out.  And
                      get the dirt around it.

            As Satch turns to talk to a second UNIFORM and a couple of
            SURVEYORS, John notices a man raking leaves in a yard not far
            away.  As he starts to him, to Satch:

<b>                                JOHN
</b>                      I think I'll visit the neighbor.

<b>            INT. SHEPARD RESIDENCE - DAY - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            CLOSE ON FRED SHEPARD, 72.  As the scene unfolds, we can SEE
            the half torn down diner/crime scene through a window.  Satch
            oversees the operation.

            MRS. SHEPARD, 70, hands John a cup of coffee.

<b>                                JOHN
</b>                      Thanks.

            John looks out the window.

<b>                                MR. SHEPARD
</b>                      Used to get breakfast there all the time
                      back from the boat.  Them Greeks were
                      good people.  Once that McDonalds opened
                      up on Dyckman, they lost all their
                      business.

            John glances around the room - notes family PHOTOGRAPHS.

            There's a picture of Shepard in younger days on a commercial
            fishing boat.  Next to it a faded black and white picture of
            Mrs. Shepard, 35.  A few pictures of the Shepards and their
            YOUNG SON.  And at the end, a color photograph of the same
            son, about 20, in DRESS BLUES, graduating from the Police
            Academy - CLASS OF '64.

<b>                                JOHN
</b>                      Your son on the job?

<b>                                MR. SHEPARD
</b>                      Was.  Carl died in the line of duty.
                      October '69.

<b>                                JOHN
</b>                      I'm sorry.

            Shepard points to a frame above the fireplace: Distinguished
            Service Medal, CARL SHEPARD, awarded posthumously.

<b>                                MR. SHEPARD
</b>                      My boy lived and bled blue.

            Silence.  Mr. and Mrs. Shepard stand very still.  John
            discreetly glances at his watch.

<b>            EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
            THUNDER in the distance.  CRIME SCENE personnel have made
            some progress in unearthing the skeletal remains.  A couple
            of drops of rain tap the ground and the bones.

            John stands looking down at the skeleton.  A long beat.  And
            then he turns to Satch and they start for the car.  Behind
            them, the skeleton is carefully pulled free from the ground.
            WE SEE its wrists are BOUND with GLASS TAPE.

            Julia hands John a Coke.  Close on her face - she feels her

            They share a laugh.  And then slowly the laughter dies.
            John's expression changes as he quietly lights a cigarette.
            Julia knows what he's thinking...

                      Truth is, most of the stuff I know is
                      from the stories you used to tell.  But
                      they're not mine.  They're not my
                      memories.  They're yours.

            Julia glances at an old photo of Frank, then back to John.

<b>            A DISTINCTIVE BURN SCAR GRADUALLY MORPHING ONTO JOHN'S DESK.

            John pushes the Bushmills to the side, staring at the scar.
            It hits him - hard.

<b>                                JOHN

            John rubs his fingers over the old burn scar.

</b>                      You burnt the desk...I can see it.

            Eerie quiet, the only sound is the rain outside John's
            window.

                      anomaly.  I think they said it was
                      connected to some storm in '69.

            Frank glances at DAILY NEWS HEADLINE - SPACE STORM.  He says
            nothing for a long beat, struggling to understand.

            reality of the situation.  Slowly accepting.

            Quiet beat.  A burst of static crackles the air.

            More static.  The signal breaks up, then returns weaker.

            Moonlight casts a glow over the sleeping Johnny.  Frank steps
            in and stands looking down at him.

<b>            EXT. ROOF OF JOHN'S HOUSE - NIGHT - 1998

            John crawls out a window, through the rain, onto the roof.

<b>            JOHN'S POV
</b>
            Rusted Ham radio antenna, half-fallen over.

            John scoots over to it, straightening it.  But he slips,
            sliding down the roof, coming to rest against the chimney.

            A light pops on from an upstairs window across the street.
            Gordo appears in the window.  Does a double take when he sees
            John, sitting on the roof, soaked, drunk.

<b>                                GORDO

</b>                      I talked to him Gordo.  I talked to my
                      Dad.

            Gordo's heart starts to break.  His best friend has slipped
            over the edge.

<b>                                GORDO
</b>                      C'mon, man.  Get inside.  I'll come over.

<b>                                JOHN
</b>                      No.  I gotta tell him the address, so he
                      doesn't go in.

            The LEGEND reads:

            OCTOBER 12th - SECOND GAME OF THE WORLD SERIES

<b>            EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE/BUXTON SEED CO. - AFTERNOON - 1969

            BLACK CLOUDS, EARTH SHATTERING THUNDER.  A massive BOLT OF
            LIGHTNING rockets out of the menacing sky STRIKING THROUGH A
            WINDOW on the 3rd floor of the warehouse.  A FIRE BEGINS.

<b>            INT. FIRE HOUSE - 9TH BATTALION/REC ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            GAME 2 plays on TV.  Butch, Gibson and the rest of the unit
            sit around enjoying the game.  A very distracted Frank stands
            watching from the doorway to the kitchen.

            We are in the bottom of the 9th with the Baltimore Orioles'
            Brooks Robinson coming to the plate.

<b>                                GIBSON
</b>                      Oh, man. Robinson is gonna nail it and
                      we're gonna be dead.

            SUDDENLY THE ALARM SOUNDS, moving the groaning firemen
            reluctantly to action, and freezing Frank in surging anxiety.

            Gibson is up and passing Frank...who begins to move like he's
            in a trance.

            A RAPID MONTAGE of Frank, Butch and the others readying to
            head out.  Gibson grabs a little TRANSISTOR RADIO.

<b>                                BUTCH

                      Lit up abandoned warehouse.  West 49th.

            Frank looks like he's going to throw up.

            John, lost in thought, rounds a corner towards the bar.

<b>            EXT. STREET - LADDER TRUCK - MOVING - AFTERNOON - 1969
</b>
            The LADDER &amp; ENGINE trucks barrel out of the firehouse.

            As SIRENS SCREAM, Frank and Gibson secure themselves into
            position.  Gibson excitedly switches on his radio to the
            game.  He notes that Frank is not the least bit into it.

<b>                                GIBSON
</b>                      Sully, you cool?

            Frank seems not to hear him.

<b>                                GIBSON (CONT'D)
</b>                      Frank.  Hey, man.  You alright?

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                      I'm alright, Gibby.

            From the RADIO we HEAR the last play of the game as Brooks
            Robinson grounds out 3rd to 1st.  METS WIN!  CHEERS are heard
            in the streets and from the CABS of the racing fire trucks.

            Gibson whoops it up.  Frank barely acknowledges the win.

<b>            INT. COP BAR - DUSK - 1998

            John moves through the crowd of cops - ad lib greetings -
            slides into a booth occupied by Satch and Gordo.

<b>                                GORDO

            John shoots a look at Gordo, who quickly changes the subject.

            Located off the East River in lower Manhattan.  The 9th
            Battalion Fire trucks are first on the scene.  A couple of
            GREEN &amp; WHITES are already there, uniform cops keeping a few
            onlookers at a safe distance.

            FLAMES shoot out from the 4th and 5th FLOOR WINDOWS.
            Starting to lick their way up to the 6th floor and roof.
            SMOKE billows out of the windows on the 3rd and 2nd floors.
            Lighter smoke spirals out from the door on the 1st floor.

            Frank, Gibson and other firemen under Butch's command take
            stock of the situation and start to deploy.

            HOSES are run from HYDRANTS to the PUMPER TRUCKS.

            The LADDER is swung into position for an assault on the roof.

            Frank nods in agreement.  Directly above them, another BOLT
            OF LIGHTNING CRACKS through the darkening sky.

            A death shudder creeps up Frank's spine.  And for the first
            time in his life, Frank Sullivan is SCARED SHITLESS.

            Frank stares up at the sky, transfixed.  THUNDER punches the
            sky with a huge roar.  RAIN starts to fall.

            And in the distance, as if from inside the burning building,
            a FAINT SCREAMING is first heard, and growing louder.

<b>                                FRANK

            Suddenly, out of the building runs a STONED TEENAGE GIRL
            screaming and babbling incoherently.

<b>                                GIRL

                      there.  She's trapped!  Please!

            Immediately galvanized, Frank moves to the girl.

                      gonna help.  Okay?   Okay.

            She starts to calm down.

</b>                      Now tell me, who's up there?

            Frank looks to Butch.  A beat.  Butch gives him the nod.

            Frank and Gibson step into the warehouse.  Butch behind them.
            Flames haven't reached this area yet, but the ROAR of the
            fire above them is deafening, and smoke billows down THE
            STAIRWAY before them.  They sprint towards it and start up.
            ONE FLOOR.  TWO FLOORS.  THREE FLOORS, and suddenly they are
            face to face with a WALL OF FIRE blocking access to the 4th
            floor.

            Frank and Gibson stop and stare into the inferno.

            And he barrels through the line of fire onto the 4th floor.
            Gibson starts to do the same when the 5th floor gives way
            above Frank, sending burning timber and debris cascading
            around him and cutting off Gibson's route.

            Now Frank's only way to go is up the stairs toward the 5th
            floor.  He turns to Gibson.  Coming up behind him is Butch.
            Across a gulf of flames Frank yells and waves at them to get
            the hell out.  And then suddenly, part of the 3rd floor
            around Gibson and Butch starts to go.

            Frank turns and bolts for the 5th floor as a huge flaming

            works himself and the girl onto the top of the chute.

            The whole GODDAMN BUILDING is going to COLLAPSE.

            SILENCE.  Then the thunderous SOUND of the WAREHOUSE CAVING

            1976: Johnny winning a swimming race at Longbranch Boys Club,
            Frank cheering.

            1984: Frank, Julia and Satch beaming with pride as John
            graduates from the police academy.

            These images appear as DISJOINTED FRAGMENTS OF NEW MEMORIES -
            A PAST THAT DIDN'T EXIST BEFORE.  A past where Frank Sullivan
            didn't die in that fire.

            It's like watching random frames from the Sullivan Family's
            8mm home movies as John's brain struggles to absorb decades
            of NEW MEMORIES in the span of seconds.

            His hand shaking, John takes a long sip of his beer.  Gordo

                      die in the fire.

            A loaded silence.  Three guys looking at each other, thinking
            very different things.

            Nothing but static.  Frank jiggles the frequency dial.

            Silence.  And then a voice...

<b>                                JOHNNY (O.S.)
</b>                      I'm right here, Daddy.

            Frank turns.  Johnny, sleepy faced, wrapped in his blankie,
            stands just outside the room - he looks a little scared.

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                      It's okay, Chief.
                          (beat)
                      C'mere.

            Johnny shuffles over, Frank lifts him up on his knee -
            brushes the hair out of his face...and gets an idea.

            Streetlights flood the tree-lined street.  Frank &amp; Johnny
            standing next to the little red bicycle.

</b>
            Johnny's eyes: SHAME &amp; FEAR - doesn't want to disappoint his
            father again, but too scared to get on the bike.  Frank
            reaches out, holds Johnny's hand.

<b>                                JOHNNY
</b>                      I'm scared.

                      Spirit and guts, Chief.

            A long beat.  Johnny takes a deep breath, nods OK, slowly
            getting on the bike.  Frank's holding on to the seat.

<b>                                FRANK (CONT'D)

                      'til you say okay.

            Johnny takes a gulp of air, starts pedaling.  Slowly moving
            forward.  The bike picks up some speed.

<b>                                FRANK (CONT'D)

            Frank's still running alongside, holding on to the seat.

<b>                                JOHNNY
</b>                      Okay!

            Frank lets go.  Johnny keeps pumping those little six-year
            old legs.  A bit wobbly at first, but he's gonna make it.  On
            Johnny's eyes: determination &amp; self-confidence.

            Johnny blissfully riding around Frank in a big gentle circle.
            Frank slowly spins around keeping his eyes on his Little
            Chief.

<b>            INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT - 1998
</b>
            John walks in the front door, takes off his coat...

            The house looks different.  Cleaner, furnishings less ragged.
            John moves through his home, taking in the subtle changes.
            He reaches the study.  And there, beside the desk, is
            something that makes him stop:

            A PHOTOGRAPH on the wall beside the desk -- FRANK, JULIA &amp;
<b>            FOURTEEN YEAR-OLD JOHNNY SULLIVAN.
</b>
<b>                                JOHN
</b>                      Oh my God...

            The picture changed.  John aged from 6 to 14.  Julia's
            hairstyle and clothes changed from 60's to 70's.  Frank's
            hair receded and grayed.  Jon is staring at evidence of a
            history that didn't exist before.

            John grabs the old family scrapbook he found in Frank's
            trunk.  Opens it, unfolds "FIREMAN KILLED" CLIPPING.

            The main headline still reads: "OCTOBER 13, 1969.  AMAZIN'S
<b>            TAKE GAME 2.  2-1 LEAD.  SEE SPORTS."
</b>
            But the sub headline now reads: "FIREMAN RESCUES RUNAWAY FROM
<b>            INFERNO"
</b>
            John turns, stares at the radio questioningly.  He starts to
            sit down at the desk when he spots something on the front
            edge of it.  WORDS CARVED INTO THE WOOD, 29 YEARS AGO by fire
            fighter Frank Sullivan.  The day John saved his father's
            life: I'M STILL HERE CHIEF

            The last letter is missing.  But then a patch of wood starts
            to morph - as if it were being carved by an invisible knife.

<b>            A BURST OF STATIC.  RADIO CRACKLES TO LIFE.

            One hand on the squawk bar, the other holds the jack-knife he
            is using to finish carving the letter F.

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                      You're the voice of an angel, Johnny.  If
                      you hadn't told me, no way I would'a ever
                      made it.

            Frank cuts himself off in mid-sentence.

<b>                                JOHN
</b>                      Dad, you there?  You okay?

<b>                                FRANK

                      What about you?  I want to know.  About
                      you.  And your mom.

            John hesitates for a moment.  Lights up a smoke.

<b>                                JOHN
</b>                      We're doing all right, Dad.  We're doing
                      good.

<b>                                FRANK

<b>                                JOHN
</b>                      It's hard to explain.  Something happened
                      today.  It was like a dream.  And when I
                      woke up I had all these new memories.
                      Good times.  Times we never had before.

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                      I'm glad.

            But John looks troubled.  Something bothering him.  He takes
            a hit off his cigarette.

<b>                                JOHN
</b>                      Dad, I gotta tell you this...cause you

</b>                      What it was like when you died in the
                      fire...

            Both men are silent for some moments.  The hum of static.  A
            breath, then --

                                JOHN (cont'd)
                      We needed you.  I needed you.  So many

                      Mom tried.  But she was hurting.  I used
                      to hear her, every night, for years,
                      crying herself to sleep.

            Frank grips the radio mic, stunned.

<b>                                FRANK

<b>                                JOHN
</b>                      Well, you think about it.  And you

                      again.  I don't ever want Mom...

            John's voice cracks, choking back the tears.

                      love you, son.

            A blast of static.  The signal is gone.  It is quiet.

            John leans back.  Takes a breath.  Reaches out for the phone.

            As John slowly hangs up the phone, something catches his eye.
            Something that wasn't there yesterday.

            Through several glass windows a CLOCK READS: 11:52 PM.

            Julia and other medical personnel are working on a heart
            attach victim and they are winning.  She is in charge and she
            is impressive.  Cool...efficient...expert.

            A sixth sense causes her to look up to see:

            Standing behind the windows.  Motionless.  Gazing at his
            wife.

            Julia holds on him for a split second, concern and surprise
            etching across her face.  She turns back to her work, then
            says something to another ER nurse, who nods okay.  Satisfied
            the patient is out of the woods, she peels off her gloves and
            heads for the door.

            He takes her in his arms, snuggling his head against her
            neck, losing himself in the scent of her hair.

                      rest of your life.

            It's hard to tell, we can't see his face, but it looks like
            Frank is crying.

<b>                                JULIA
</b>                      Frankie, what is it?

            But Frank is silent.  So they just stand there, holding each
            other.  And then Julia notices the burn and scrape marks on
            Frank's arms and neck.

                                JULIA (cont'd)
                      I got a bad feeling today...I was
                      worried.

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                      I'm here.  Bruised but not broken.

            Frank pulls his head back, looks into his wife's eyes and
            kisses her on the mouth.  It's a long kiss.

            As they come up for air.

<b>                                JULIA
</b>                      Where's Johnny?

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                      I tucked him in at Gordo's.

<b>                                JULIA
</b>                      You give him his drops?

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                      One in each ear.
                          (beat)
                      What would you do without me?

<b>                                JULIA
</b>                      Probably marry some rich doctor and never
                      have to work...

            Julia sees something through a glass door that stops her
            short.  A YOUNG INTERN is standing over a gurneyed PATIENT.
            The YOUNG INTERN is changing the I.V. BAG.

                                JULIA (cont'd)
                      What's he doing?  Frank, I gotta...

            He knows she's back on the job.  Waves "no problem."

<b>            INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY CUBICLE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Julia interrupts the Young Intern as he hooks up the bag.

<b>                                JULIA
</b>                      Excuse me doctor, is that Benazepril?

<b>                                INTERN
</b>                      Yes.

            Julia quickly shuts off the I.V.

<b>                                JULIA
</b>                      I gave this patient 50 mills of Benedryal
                      on admittance.
                          (unhooking I.V. bag)
                      Mix them and he's dead.

<b>                                INTERN
</b>                      Why wasn't I made aware?

<b>                                JULIA
</b>                      It's in his chart.

            The intern steps back: "Oh shit."  Julia takes charge.

            The patient stirs: a SCRAGGLY HIPPIE, looks kind of like
            Pacino in SERPICO.  A breathing mask covers his bearded face.
            Barely conscious, his eyes focus on Julia.

            After a quick double check of the patient, Julia looks up.
            Through the glass door she can see Frank watching.

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                          (mouthing to words)

</b>                          (mouthing back)
                      I love you more.

            The clock on the wall now reads: 12:01 AM.

            And the LEGEND reads:

            MEN and WOMEN, standing and sitting, seen only from the waist
            down.  All wearing dark clothes and speaking in hushed

            A terrified and disoriented John stumbles out of bed.  He
            moves to the bathroom.  But he stops.  Something is wrong.
            The bedroom has changed.  It looks like a DUMP.

            John shakes his head, trying to blink away the nightmare.
            But the room does not change back.  He goes to teh bathroom.
            Splashes his face.  He looks up to the mirror and...

<b>            INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY

            The same horrible instant replay.  Flashes of faces swimming
            into the POV...

</b>
            He is CROUCHED UNDER A TABLE.  STARING AT THE CASKET.  Alone.
            Bewildered.  Crying.

            A MAN, seen only from teh waist down, approaches the table.
            As he crouches down his face drops into the frame.  It is
            FRANK.  His face etched in a terrible pain.

<b>            INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING
</b>
            The kitchen looks different: dirtier, uncared-for.  John
            looks different too: like a guy on the tail end of a lifetime
            bender.  He cracks open a Bushmills.  Pours a couple of shots
            into his instant coffee.  Several sips to settle his nerves.
            He reaches for the cordless phone and HITS SPEED DIAL #3.

<b>                                CASHIER (V.O.)
</b>                      Noah's Deli.  Can you hold?

            Confused, John clicks down the receiver.  His hand is shaking
            as he punches the speed dial button for the second time.

</b>                      Noah's Deli.

            On the slam of John's phone, we got to...

<b>            INT. JULIA'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - MANHATTAN - MORNING
</b>
            John knocks on the door.  It opens to reveal a Jamaican woman
            clutching a crying infant, a toddler hanging off her leg.
            Behind them we half recognize Julia's apartment.  We know
            it's her apartment because of the BAY WINDOW and the view of
            THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE.  But everything else is
            different.  Different furniture.  Different pain job.

            John stands speechless.  The Jamaican woman regards him...

<b>                                JAMAICAN WOMAN
</b>                      Can I help you?

<b>                                JOHN
</b>                          (relaxed)
                      I'm looking for Julia Sullivan.

</b>                      I think you have the wrong apartment.

<b>                                JOHN
</b>                      But this is her place.  910 Riverside.

</b>                      I'm sorry, but no one by that name lives
                      here.

            John just stands there, lost, questioning his grip on
            reality.  Liquor on his breath, fear in his eyes, he is a
            scary sight.  Jamaican woman does the smart thing - she slams
            the door.

            ON SATCH, scavenging the fridge while absorbed in some
            papers.

            Through the open door he SPOTS JOHN across the squad room.
            Even at that distance, Satch can see John's unsteady walk and
            fucked up demeanor.  Satch's eyes go to stone.

<b>            INT. 23RD PRECINCT - MEN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            John leans over the sink, wet paper towels pressed to his
            face.  He barely reacts to the SOUND of the door.  He does
            react to the silence that follows.  Satch stands in the
            doorway...looking him over.

<b>                                JOHN
</b>                      What?

            A long silence.

<b>                                SATCH
</b>                      Another rough night, huh?  That it?

</b>                      Yeah.  That's it.

            John moves for the door.  But Satch grabs him, slams him
            against the wall.  Startled, John freezes.

<b>                                SATCH
</b>                      Do not disrespect me.  Disrespect

                      anybody else around here.  You got that?

            John shrugs, sagging against the wall.

</b>                      This is getting real old, John.  And I'm

                      your old man.  Not cause of your mom.
                      But because of you.

            Satch steps back.  An awkward beat.

<b>            INT. 23RD PRECINCT - DETECTIVE SQUAD ROOM - CONTINUOUS

            Satch and John approach their adjoining desks.  Satch slides
            an 8X10 PHOTO off the top of an OLD YELLOWED POLICE FILE and
            hands it to John.  It is a picture of the skeleton discovered
            behind the Greek Diner.  But what catches John's attention,
            what picks at his subconscious, is the decaying GLASS TAPE
            binding the wrists.

<b>                                SATCH

                      Nightingale Murder?

            John looks from the photo to the file on Satch's desk.  It
            reads: NIGHTINGALE MURDERS.  John slowly sinks into his
            chair.

</b>                      Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three.
                      He killed three women.

<b>                                SATCH

                      than anybody, John.  You've read this
                      file a thousand times.

            John fixes on the file.  Then slowly reaches for it.  It's
            filled with police and forensics reports.  And PHOTOS.  Crime
            scene shots of 9 DEAD WOMEN.  Linked by TWO gruesome details -
            they were all GARROTED, wrists bound with GLASS TAPE.

            John turns over the last PHOTO and his heart stops...his
            universe crashing down on him.

            The answer is no.  He looks terrible, as haunted as any man

            the desk - I'M STILL HERE CHIEF.  He rubs his fingers over
            the smooth carving...his eyes going to the radio.

            A quiet moment.  John slowly puts his hand on the squawk,
            leans into the mic...

<b>                                JOHN

                          (silence)
                      Dad?  I need you to be there.

            A long beat.  The hum of static.  And then...

                      murdered three women, all nurses, between
                      '68 and '69.  The papers called them the
                      Nightingale Murders.  They never caught
                      him.  But the killings just stopped.

</b>                      Dad, we did something.  Something to make

                      Mom wasn't dead.  But then after you
                      didn't die in the fire something must
                      have happened.  And this guy, this
                      Nightingale guy, he kept on killing...it
                      was like a spree...seven more women.

                      you're crazy.

<b>                                FRANK

                          (realizing)
                      Wait a minute.  I might not know who he
                      is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I
                      got the case file.  We know what he's
                      gonna do before he does it.

<b>                                FRANK

<b>                                JOHN
</b>                      They will if they catch him in the act.
                      You can make that happen, Dad.  You can
                      tail the victim and call it in at just
                      the right moment.

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                      I don't know, John.  I'm a fire fighter.
                      This is...this is different.

<b>                                JOHN
</b>                      I do know.  I'm a cop.  This is what I
                      do.

            John takes a long sip from the Bushmills.

<b>                                JOHN (CONT'D)
</b>                      You ever talk to a victim's family?  The
                      one's left behind?  They don't act like
                      what you'd think.  There's panic and
                      fear.  But mostly, it's like there's this
                      logic problem.  And if they could only
                      solve it, everything would be okay.
                          (a breath)
                      But if you look real close - look at
                      their eyes - you can see it.  Just a
                      glimmer.  But somewhere they know.  They
                      know their world is never gonna be the
                      same.

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                      What if the radio stops working?  Christ,
                      what if I can't reach you again?

<b>                                JOHN

                      those other women weren't supposed to
                      die.  We don't try to stop this guy,
                      we're gonna live with that for the rest
                      of our lives.

            Frank takes a deep breath, swallows some air.

<b>                                FRANK

                      Case file says she left St. Vincents at
                      six.  Show'd up at Cozy's Bar around six
                      thirty.  She walked outta that bar around
                      seven-thirty.  They found her dead in an
                      empty lot behind the place at eight
                      o'clock.

                      No, I want you to follow her.  See if
                      anybody's watching her, hittin' on her.
                      I'm betting somebody's gonna walk outta
                      that bar with her.  When they do, you
                      call the cops.

            Close on NIGHTINGALE FILE on John's desk.  Zoom in on the
            date below KAREN'S HOMICIDE PHOTO: October 14, 1969.

            The LEGEND reads:

            OCTOBER 14th - 3RD GAME OF THE WORLD SERIES

<b>            INT./EXT. KOREAN GROCERY - EVENING - 1969
</b>
            A woman waits to pay for a mini pack of Kleenex and some gum.
            KAREN REYNOLDS.  A wool coat over her Nurse's uniform.

            Frank's and John's voices continue over the scene.

<b>                                FRANK (V.O.)
</b>                      What do I tell them?

<b>                                JOHN (V.O.)
</b>                      Tell 'em there's a homicide in
                      progress... cause by the time they show
                      up there will be.

            As Karen moves to the cash register, the CAMERA WIDENS TO
            REVEAL FRANK, awkwardly pretending to read a magazine.

            Frank readies to follow her when he suddenly trips over a
            crate of vegetables and goes down on one knee.

            Karen looks in the direction of the accident, and for a split
            second, her eyes lock with Frank's.  Embarrassed, Frank looks
            away as he rights himself.

            Frank edges out of the grocery store as Karen steps into the
            street and dodges traffic towards a corner BAR/RESTAURANT at
            the end of the block, past a heavily overgrown VACANT LOT.

            Frank follows Karen across the street and finds himself, just
            as Karen enters the bar, at a point near the murder site
            described by John.  He pauses to stare at it.

<b>            INT. COZY'S BAR &amp; RESTAURANT - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
            Frank enters the place.  Sort of a singles atmosphere, but a
            comfortable one.  It's HAPPY HOUR.  On the TV, the Mets' Gil
            Hodges offers his analysis of Game 3.

            Frank looks about, down the bar and into an area with booths
            and tables.  A few folks at the bar.  A group of YOUNG WOMEN
            laughing in a booth.  But NO KAREN REYNOLDS.  Frank's blood
            runs cold in a spasm of panic when...

<b>                                WOMAN'S VOICE

<b>                                BARTENDER

            Frank wheels around just as Karen passes him from teh LADIES
            ROOM.  There is the trace of a bump, enough for Karen to take
            note of Frank.  Ad lib EXCUSE ME.  She then starts moving
            down teh bar towards the booth of young women.

            Frank checks out everyone in the bar, not knowing quite what
            he's looking for.

            Karen slips into the booth with her friends.  Ad lib HELLOS.

            Frank orders a beer, but his eyes are fixed on the booth.
            Karen and a friend take note of Frank staring at them.
            Embarrassed, he turns away, checking his watch: 6:40PM.  And
            at just that moment a SCRAGGLY MAN passes by, taking a seat
            at the end of the bar.  We have seen this man before.

            Satch shrugs a yes.  Wipes his hands and heads out into the
            squad.  The Young Detective follows.

            John's at his desk.  Keeps glancing at the phone, fiddling
            with the NIGHTINGALE FILE... A PHOTOGRAPH OF KAREN REYNOLDS.

            Satch passes John on his way to the coffee machine.

<b>                                SATCH
</b>                      Any word on our bones?

            John shakes his head no.  Young Detective joins Satch at the
            coffee machine.  John overhears:

<b>                                YOUNG DETECTIVE
</b>                      But how'd you think of it?

                      the last thing you're thinking about is
                      alternate side of the street parking.

            Young Detective nods, impressed.  John is less impressed.

            Frank glances at the women in the booth.  They're all looking
            at him, smiling.  A big one from Karen.

            His watch says 7:05.  Taking the new bottle, Frank steps from
            the bar, past the Scraggly Man and walks to the booth.
            Charmingly shy, Frank is kind of at a loss for words.

<b>                                FRANK

                      A married fireman.

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                      Frank.

            And Frank takes a seat, sliding in next to Karen.  An awkward
            moment for him as she takes a closer look at his face.

<b>                                KAREN

            John has a CORKBOARD set up next to his desk.  On it he has
            arrayed several photos of the Nigthingale victims under the

            At the bar, the Scraggly Man stares at Frank and the women.
            Franks checks his watch as he tells a story.  It's 7:50.

            The women around him are clearly enraptured.

            In B.G. - at the bar - the Scraggly Man, looking frustrated,
            slides off his stool and strides out of the place.

<b>                                JOHN

            But for some strange reason John has stopped listening to
            Satch.  Something else has got his full attention.  It is the
            Nightingale file that lays open on his desk.  It is
            changing...Karen Reynolds' forensic photo disappears. In fact
            everything about her, all evidence of her murder - police
            reports, photos, witness reports - is GONE.

            John's eyes shoot to the corkboard.  The head shot of Karen
            Reynolds and the date of her murder are also GONE.  John
            looks between the file and the board.

            Hearing voices, Johnny, Gordo and Elvis wander in from the
            family room.  They are in their pj's...a sleepover.  Julia

                      wants to be a policeman.  Right after he
                      retires from the majors.  We just gave
                      him a badge and a whistle for his

                      I used to play cops and robbers but y--

                          (beat)
                      But she knew, John.  A mother knows

            Julia scoops Johnny up, carrying him off to bed.  But little
            Gordo does not follow...fascinated by the radio.

            Frank laughs, as Gordo climbs up on his lab.

            John sits back, marvelling at how young Gordo sounds.  A
            thousand childhood memories playing in his head.  And then he
            lights up...realizing the opportunity.

<b>                                JOHN
</b>                      Hey, Gordo.  My name is Santa Clause.
                      And I'm gonna give you the biggest
                      Christmas present you ever had.

            Gordo looks at Frank: is this for real?  Frank nods, smiling.

            The sound of Julia's voice calling Gordo to bed.  Gordo
            scampers out.  Static filters through both radios, then...

                      anything happen to her...no matter what.

            BZZZZ-SHHH.  A burst of loud static.  The band goes dead.

            John takes a beat to come down.  He gets up, making his way
            into the KITCHEN.  There's a half-full bottle of BUSHMILLS on
            the counter.  John reaches out to grab but the bottle.  But
            then he stops.  It is time to stop.  John turns on the faucet
            and dumps the booze down the drain.

            On SOPHIA FINELLI, 55, a profound sadness sits at her core.

            of the partially disintegrated clothing found on Mary

            Mrs. Finelli gasps in recognition, her eyes turning to a
            closet door.

            John opens the door to reveal MARY's CLOTHES, lined up in
            perfect order.  Visible among them is a "Candy Striper"
            uniform... a perfect match with the patch John holds.

            Silence.  Tears start to run down her cheeks.  John
            understands this woman's pain.  He looks around the room at
            Mary's possessions.  Faded pictures.  Mary and her family.

            of the murder victims, paperwork, and calendar/timeline
            graphs sit on the table and are pinned on a cork board.  Mary

                      gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to

            The 11 O'clock NEWS is on TV.  A "Super" shows the Mets won
            Game 4.  Score 2-1.  Mets lead series: 3-1.

            CREEDENCE CLEARWATER PLAYS out of the sound system.

            Sissy takes the order from a LONG HAIRED GUY  down the bar,
            his back to the camera, and starts towards the cash register
            area.  The bartender serves Frank another club soda.  As
            Frank drinks the bartender pulls a PACK OF CIGARETTES from
            his shirt pocket.  But the pack is empty.

            The bartender laughs, as Frank stands and heads for the
            bathroom.

            A CLOCK reflected in the two-way mirror.  12:15PM.

            Satch stands drinking a cup of coffee behind the mirror.
            Before him, through the glass, sits Daryl Adams, with John
            pacing like a panther ready to spring.

            Suddenly, he slaps down crime scene homicide photos of
            several women in front of Daryl, who blanches...

<b>                                DARYL

                      anything?  She means something to me!

            John looks like he's about to hit Daryl, but he glances
            towards the two-way mirror, controls himself.

            Nilsson's EVERYBODY'S TALKIN' fills the air.

            A sexy WOMAN approaches Frank wearing an Emma Peel body suit.
            Sissy stands nearby, giving drink orders to the bartender -
            she can't help but smile at the following.

<b>                                WOMAN

            The bartender leans into the PA at the bar and announces.

<b>                                BARTENDER
</b>                      Last call.

            Frank flashes his wedding ring at the sexy woman.  Smiles at
            her and shrugs "I'm sorry."

            The clock reads 1:30AM.

            John sits at the end of the table, opposite Daryl.  His quiet
            masks the dark menace he is barely in control of.  Daryl
            stares at him like a deer caught in the headlights.

            Satch sets a Coke before Daryl and starts to leave the room.

                          (to Daryl)
                      You need to use the head?  You can,
                      y'know.  If you want to.

            Daryl shakes his head "no."

            End of the night.  The place winds down.  An old movie on the
            TV's.  Elvis' SUSPICIOUS MINDS plays softly.

            Frank watches as Sissy picks up her last tip and heads to the
            back to change into her street clothes.

<b>                                SISSY

                      next time.

            Frank smiles, checks the time.  2:00AM.  He looks around.
            Nobody suspicious about.  He starts up for the bathroom...

<b>            INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT - 1998

            Satch enters with a fresh cup of coffee, settles back to
            watch.

<b>            INTERCUT - INTERROGATION AND OBSERVATION ROOMS
</b>
            With great ceremony John removes his watch, his gun, and
            lastly, his badge, and sets them off to one side.

<b>                                JOHN
</b>                      You know, Daryl, sometimes, despite all

                      wrong.  Despite all that we would like to
                      honor in ourselves, we can come to a
                      place where we don't give a fuck.  Know
                      what I mean?

            And John starts up from his seat and walks toward Daryl.

<b>                                JOHN

            Satch opens the door and steps out.  John collects his watch,
            badge and gun and follows.

                      Not everyone fits the profile.

            Long beat.

            SUSPICIOUS MINDS filters in.  Frank zips up, heads to the
            sink.  Bends over to wash his hands, and suddenly.

            His face is smashed on the edge of the sink.  He twists to
            the floor, fighting to maintain consciousness.

            A black Frye boot explodes into Frank's gut.  He rolls over,
            looks up at the LONG HAIRED GUY from the bar.  Frank seems to
            recognize him.  We know him too - SCRAGGLY MAN.  But we don't
            know his name yet.  So we'll call him...

<b>                                KILLER

<b>            CLOSE ON

            Killer's eyes, evil fuckin' black dots.  He lifts Frank to
            his knees.  Then rips a fist into Frank's face.

<b>                                KILLER (CONT'D)
</b>                      I asked you a question, asshole.

            Frank is clearly incapacitated.  Killer lifts him to his feet
            so they are eye-to-eye.

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                          (barely able to speak)
                      Mary Finelli...

            A look of absolute shock wipes across the Killer's face.

<b>                                KILLER
</b>                      Who the fuck are you?

            Caught off guard, Frank is able to slam his knee into
            Killer's balls.  Killer goes down like a stone, but Frank is
            too battered to take advantage.

            He collapses on top of Killer, who pushes him off, scrambles
            up, and delivers a massive kick to his head.  Frank is out
            cold.

            Quickly, Killer rolls Frank over and rifles his pockets
            finding his WALLET.  He grabs something from it, then tosses
            it aside.  He then takes something out of his pocket, a thin
            leather garrote.  He coils it around his hands and snaps it
            taut.  He bends down to start the job when suddenly, the
            bathroom door opens and...

            TWO very stoned MEN stumble in.

<b>                                STONED MAN #1

<b>                                KILLER
</b>                      Yeah.  He just needs a little time
                      kissing the porcelain.

            And Killer muscles Frank into a toilet stall and puts his
            head in the bowl.  He closes the door, quickly leaving.

            In the stall, Frank spills onto the floor, his legs sticking
            out into the bathroom.  His face flush to the tile, his eyes
            trying to focus on something lying just outside the stall...

            His WALLET.

            Frank starts to come around.  He reaches out and grabs his
            wallet off the floor.  His money still there.  Credit cards,
            too.  But something's missing.  His DRIVER'S LICENSE.

            Frank bangs on it.  Scared.  Desperate.

            Frank keeps banging on the door.  A NEIGHBOR'S DOOR swings
            open a crack.  AN OLD LADY peers out from behind a security
            chain.  Frank stops banging.

            Old Lady skeptically looking him up &amp; down - noticing Frank's
            bruised face.  She quickly closes the door.

            Frank reaches inside his jacket pocket, pulls out a small
            bent metal wire, homemade LOCKPICK.  He goes to work on
            Sissy's lock.  CLICK, CLICK, CLICK - got it.  He opens the
            door, steps inside.

            It's dark.  And then a sound...scratching and popping, the
            sound of a PHONOGRAPH NEEDLE makes when it reaches the end of
            the vinyl and is scratching against the label.

            The wind catching a curtain allows the shaft of a street
            light to beam brightly into the room, and in one swift
            moment, Frank is staring at a NIGHTMARE: Sissy Clark's
            murdered body.  Her dress hiked above her waist.  Her panties
            ripped off.  Paper stuffed into her mouth. Her hands bound
            with glass tape.  Frank is transfixed and sickened by Sissy's
            twisted face, her eyes frozen open in horrible death.

            Frank staggers out of the building towards his Harley.  He
            bends over and blows his dinner, then mounts the bike and
            kicks the motor over.  As he roars off down the street, WE
            SEE in the building window...

            THE OLD LADY looking down at him.

                      Listen to me, very carefully, take your

            Frank does as John asks.  Taking out his wallet.

<b>                                FRANK (CONT'D)

                          (looking around the room)
                      Put it under the loose floorboard by the

            Frank fishes around the desk drawer for some electrical
            tape...quickly ripping off strips of tape...covering the
            wallet.  Then he goes to the window.  Crouches on the floor,
            digging his nails around edges of the loose floorboard.

<b>            BACK TO JOHN

            getting up.

                      Okay.

            John scrambles to window.  Crouches down on floor, reaching
            to find: FRANK'S WALLET COVERED IN ELECTRICAL TAPE!

            John goes back to the radio.

            They enter the living room.  No Mrs. Shepard.  John's eyes
            fix on the police academy graduation PHOTO of CARL SHEPARD.
            His gaze then shifts to photos of Mrs. Shepard.

<b>                                JOHN

                      An ugly one to tell you the truth.

            John's breath catches.  His look shifts back to the photo of
            Carl Shepard.

            Mr. Shepard reaches to open an album.  There are several
            photographs of the young Mrs. Shepard.  A couple where she is
            dressed in a NURSE'S UNIFORM.

            John is stunned.  One can only imagine what is now racing
            through his mind.

<b>                                MR. SHEPARD (CONT'D)
</b>                      The mother of a cop, and they never found
                      the bastard who did it.

            Blown away, John looks out the window to where Mary Finelli's
            skeleton was found.

<b>                                JOHN

                      in them Knapp Hearings.  Set up by some
                      dirty cops who needed a fall guy.  Hurt
                      him bad.  Would've broken his mother's
                      heart.

            John can only stay inside himself and wonder at the madness
            of the world.

<b>            INT. BROOKLYN WATERFRONT RESTAURANT - LATER
</b>
            John walks past the lunchtime crowd, makes his way to the
            BAR.  Grabs a stool two...seats away from...Carl Shepard.

            John orders a soda, glances over at Shepard.  Their eyes
            meet.  John holds his gaze.  A slight nod...

<b>                                JOHN

                      No.  What house you work?

            John gets up, slides next to Shepard.

                      goes back to your day...one of the
                      Nightingale murders.

            Beat.

<b>                                SHEPARD

                      thirty years ago.  Found her bones last
                      week.  Buried behind some old diner, up
                      by Dyckman street.  Mary Finelli.

            John waits again for Shepard's reaction...

<b>                                SHEPARD
</b>                      Huh.

</b>                          (sipping drink)
                      Talk about dumb luck.  Odds of anybody
                      finding that girl, thirty years later.
                      And then the chances of hitting a
                      dental...forget about it.  Bets part is
                      she's the first victim.  She knew the
                      doer.  I'm betting those bones are gonna
                      do a lot of talking.

            Shepard says nothing, but his eyes are burning into John.

<b>                                JOHN (CONT'D)
</b>                      The past is a funny thing.  We've all got

                      know when they're gonna pop up and bite
                      you in the ass, Carl.

            John slips something on the bar, next to Shepard.  It is a
            crime scene photo of Shepard's murdered mother.  He reels
            back, totally losing his veil of composure.  He is freaked.

<b>                                SHEPARD

                      coming.  And I'm gonna steal your life
                      away.  You went down 30 years ago.  You
                      just don't know it yet.

            And with that, John gets up, leaving Shepard stunned.

            and demeanor.

            Frank suddenly spots something through the front window.
            Satch's partner, PHIL HAYES, and TWO UNIFORMS out at the
            curb.

            Half a penny drops.  All his senses go on alert.  And
            instinct kicks...he hits the squawk bar.

<b>                                FRANK (CONT'D)

                      outside.

            Frank releases the squawk bar.

            Johnny and Gordo remain fixed on the game, oblivious to
            anything else.  In the kitchen, we can see Julia moving
            around putting away the groceries.

            Julia now becomes aware of the tension in the voices in the
            other room.  She looks outside and sees Phil and the
            uniforms.  She looks at Frank and Satch with confusion.

            Frank hits the squawk bar again.  He wants John to hear this.

<b>                                FRANK (CONT'D)
</b>                      What is going on here, Satch?  What are
                      those guys doing out there?

<b>                                SATCH
</b>                      I think you know, Frank.

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                      No, I don't.

<b>                                SATCH
</b>                      Let's go outside and talk.  We need to do
                      that.

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                      About what?

<b>                                SATCH
</b>                      Let's go.  Do us both a favor.

            A long beat.  Frank sees Julia staring at them.  She is now a
            bundle of growing anxiety.  Frank stands up.

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                      Okay.
                          (to Julia)
                      It's okay, Bud.  I'll be right back.
                          (into radio)
                      Stay there, John.

            And then he and Satch walk out the front door.

<b>            EXT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            ...and towards a spot halfway between the house and the cops.
            From inside the house, Johnny and Gordo have begun to take in
            the activity.

<b>                                SATCH
</b>                      Where were you last night, Frank?

            The rest of the penny drops.  Frank stalls, trying to think

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                      What do you mean?

<b>                                SATCH
</b>                      Do you know where I found this?

            And he hands FRANK his missing DRIVER'S LICENSE.  Frank looks
            like a truck hit him.

<b>                                SATCH (CONT'D)
</b>                      415 Greenwich St.  #302.  Under the body
                      of a murdered woman.

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                      No.  This isn't what you think.

<b>                                SATCH
</b>                      I wanna be wrong here.  But we need to go
                      to the precinct and talk about it.

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                      Okay, okay.  I need to go say something
                      to Julia and finish up with the guy on
                      the radio.

<b>                                SATCH
</b>                      You can talk to Julia.  Forget the radio.

            Frank nods.  Takes stock of the cops by the cars and heads
            back into the house.

<b>            INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Julia, who has been watching through a front room window with
            Johnny, moves to meet Frank.  Behind Frank, Satch signals
            Phil and the uniforms that all is okay, giving Frank a couple
            of steps on him.

            Frank steps into the house and wraps his arms around Julia,
            turning so he can see both Satch outside and where he wants
            to go inside.

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                      Trust me, Bud.  Do that for me.

<b>            INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - STUDY - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Frank moves Julia toward teh desk, lulling Satch a moment,
            then quickly steps to the HAM radio and hits the squawk bar.

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                      John, you there?

<b>                                JOHN (O.S.)
</b>                          (over the HAM)
                      Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                      Satch is busting me for Sissy Clark's
                      murder.  John...

            Julia stares dumbfounded at Frank.

<b>                                SATCH (O.S.)
</b>                      Frank.

            Satch strides by Julia and reaches to take Frank's elbow.
            Frank wheels at the sound of his name and the touch, and he
            lurches back from Satch.

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                      ...you gotta help me, Chief.

            -- and the movement yanks the mic cord to the radio tight,
            dragging it to the edge of the desk.

            Johnny tears into the room and clutches onto his mother.
            "Daddy, Daddy!"

<b>                                SATCH
</b>                      That's not the deal, Frank.  Don't do
                      this to your family.

            And Frank throws his hands up in front of his chest in an "I
            give up" gesture.

<b>                                JOHN (O.S.)
</b>                      Dad!  Dad!  What's going on?  Satch?!

            And the HAM radio CRASHES to the floor in 1969.

            1998.  The HAM RADIO TRANSFORMING...a large dent appearing in

            Dread creeps into John's face as we SMASH CUT TO:

<b>            JOHN'S POV
</b>
            We see what John sees in 1998.  But we also go inside his
            mind and glimpse flashes of new childhood memories.  Memories
            of seeing his father arrested for murder.  Images that match
            JOHNNY'S POV from moments ago in 1969.

<b>            INT. 17TH PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY - 1969

            Frank sits at a metal table bolted to the floor, Satch sits
            across.  Phil stands.  Two cups of coffee on the table.  The
            room is very bare.  Cinder block walls.

            Padded locks and bars over the windows.  A small metal
            cabinet against the far wall.  Satch and Phil smoke.  Frank
            does not.

                      precinct.

            Satch stares at Frank with utter incredulity.  Phil lights a
            smoke, tossing the pack and the matchbook on the table.

<b>                                FRANK (CONT'D)

            Satch looks over at Phil.

</b>                      Give me a little time with this guy.

            Phil nods his understanding, steps out of the room.

            It's quiet for a moment.  And then a sound filters in under
            the door.  The sound of cops cheering.  It's the World
            Series.

            Frank sits up - takes a beat.

                      Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot.

                      Nightingale's profile.  You understand

            We hear the bolt slide, the knob turns and the door opens.

            Frank struggles for an answer...but comes up speechless.
            Satch looks like his heart is breaking.  Unable to comprehend
            how Frank could have slipped this far.  A long beat, then...

<b>                                FRANK

                      coming for her.

            Satch snorts, incredulous.  Frank reaches over the table and
            takes his hand, deadly serious.

<b>            INT. 17TH PRECINCT - SGT'S DESK - MOMENTS LATER

            Satch walks down the stairs.  Julia alone on the bench.

            She sees Satch approaching, stands up, looking at him for an
            answer, for an explanation...for hope.

                      Let's walk, get a cup of coffee.

            Julia nods okay.  They exit the precinct house and into...

<b>            EXT. 17TH PRECINCT - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            ...the street.  Around the corner we catch sight of someone
            familiar - someone Julia and Satch don't recognize: Shepard.

            Shepard turns, gliding through the lobby like a shark...

<b>            INT. COFFEE SHOP - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
            Satch and Julia sit at a booth in the back.  Satch stirs his
            coffee, trying to start a very hard conversation.  As he
            struggles to begin, the camera notices something in the B.G.
            At the counter: a few stray people gathered around watching
            the WORLD SERIES on an old TV.

<b>            AUDIO COMES UP.

<b>            INT. 17TH PRECINCT - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

            Shepard passes the COFFEE ROOM.  It is packed with
            detectives, gathered around a TV...watching the game.  Phil
            Hayes is among them.  And as Shepard passes, Phil half
            catches a glimpse of him as he glides down the hall and
            enters.

            Frank looks up to see Shepard, who quickly closes the door
            behind him... and unholsters his gun.  An eerie moment.

<b>                                SHEPARD
</b>                      On your feet.

            Frank waits a beat.  Then very slowly, he stands.

<b>                                SHEPARD (CONT'D)
</b>                      Now turn around, face the wall.

            Frank steps back, slowly turning.  Shepard holsters the gun.
            Kicks Frank up against the wall as he reaches into his pocket
            and takes out the leather garrote we saw in the Peppermint
            Lounge Bathroom.  He coils it around his hands.

            Frank is trembling.

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                          (facing the wall)
                      You twisted animal...

                          (snapping garrote tight)
                      That's why you hung yourself.

            But Frank turns.

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                      You try putting that thing around my neck
                      and I'll rip your throat out.  You want
                      me dead, use the gun.

            Shepard smiles, unfazed...

<b>                                SHEPARD
</b>                      Let me draw you a picture.  You live at
                      1060 41st Ave.  You have a wife who works
                      at New York Hospital.  And a six-year old
                      at P.S. 130.

            Shepard gives Frank a look that would make a Marine Drill
            Sergeant shit his pants.  Shepard knows Frank's weakness, the
            one thing that would make him submit to death.

            Closing his eyes, Frank turns to face the wall...But the door
            handle rattles, someone is outside coming in.  Shepard
            quickly yanks Frank away from the wall, shoving him in a
            chair at the interrogation table.

            The door opens.

<b>                                PHIL

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                      You got to help me.  He's trying to kill
                      me.

            Shepard just laughs.  Phil scans the room - everything looks
            normal, a cop questioning a perp.

<b>                                SHEPARD
</b>                      Mind if we take it outside?

            Phil shrugs okay.

                      I'll be right back.

            Shepard and Phil step out - bolting the door behind them.

            Shepard and Phil stand outside the door.

            Frank's expression begins to harden.  His eyes search teh
            room.  CLOSE ON his EYES.  He looks like John - controlled
            rage piercing through that Sullivan thousand yard stare.

            He stands, turning around, looking for something, anything
            that he can use to get the hell out of there.

            His mind's racing, fire fighter training kicking in.  And
            then he looks up - just below the ceiling, above the door - a
<b>            2'X2' ELECTRICAL CONDUCTOR BOX.
</b>
            Follow Frank's eyes to something else.  An AIR CONDITIONER
<b>            MOUNTED IN THE WINDOW.
</b>
            Frank goes to the window.  Runs his fingers along the air
            conditioner's thick electrical cord - thinking.  He unplugs
            it.  And then he RIPS cord out of the unit, exposing wire.

            A loud cheer rises out of the coffee room - the game is
            heating up.  Shepard and Phil are still standing outside the
            interrogation room.  Shepard flashes a smile, having said
            something that makes Phil laugh...

            Julia's crying.  Satch has no words to comfort her, now way
            of explaining any of this.  He reaches out across the
            table...taking her hand.  And as they sit quietly.

            CAMERA tracks towards the counter.  And we hear something
            that Satch does not.  The sound of a voice.  TV ANNOUNCER.

            Frank uses the heel of his shoe to rip the plug off the other
            end of the electrical cord.  Both ends now have exposed
            wires.

            Close on a MATCH.  Pull back to reveal Shepard lighting
            Phil's cigarette, then one for himself.  They are inside the

                      of the ball?

            Shepard inhales deeply, sneaking a glance down hall at the
            closed interrogation room door.

            Satch looks past Julia, distracted, curious.

</b>                      Can you excuse me for a second?

            Julia seems bewildered as Satch gets up out of the booth,
            making his way through the restaurant and towards the TV.

            Frank, in full throttle, drags a chair against the wall.
            Climbs on the chair, uses a dime to unscrew the ELECTRICAL
<b>            CONDUCTOR BOX.
</b>
            He then unscrews the master fuse and SHOVES ONE END OF THE

</b>            After re-tightening the fuse, and careful not to touch the
            other end of the cord, he jumps off the chair.

            Wall to wall cops.  Mesmerized by the game, especially Phil.

            Shepard gives Phil one last smile, then slips out - casually
            heading down the hall...towards the interrogation room.

            Frank, sweating bullets now, takes the two coffee cups off
            the table and pours their contents ON THE FLOOR.  The coffee
            forms a SMALL PUDDLE which Frank is careful not to let slip
            over the door saddle.

            He puts the cups down.  Then opens the cabinet, rifling
            through, finding a can of LYSOL spray.

            The door knob turns.  The door half-opens.  Shepard sticks
            his head in, scanning the room.  He relaxes a bit when he
            sees Frank sitting quietly at the table.

            Shepard opens the door a little further, takes a half step
            into the room...and into the puddle of coffee!

            Frank raises his arm.  He's holding the live electrical cord.
            Shepard: What the fuck?  Frank flicks the cord...which lands
            like a snake at Shepard's feet...in the puddle of coffee.

            5,000 volts surge through Shepard's body.

            But something is wrong with the TV.  A spark shoots out of
            the back of the set.

            And then the entire 17th Precinct goes DARK.  Frank has
            shorted out the electrical system.

            The cops look at each other in a moment of pissed confusion.

            Frank lunges over the table, smashing a wooden chair over
            Shepard's head.  He's in overdrive.  Kicking the still live
            cord out of the coffee puddle, he then drags Shepard's body
            into the room, shutting the door.

            Frank quickly rips off Shepard's SPORTS JACKET, pocketing
            Shepard's WALLET and BADGE.

            And then, moving very fast, Frank grabs the LYSOL can and the
            matches Phil left on the table.  He LIGHTS A MATCH and holds
            it IN FRONT OF THE LYSOL CAN.  He points the can at the
            ceiling - at the FIRE ALARM SENSORS.  Hits SPRAY button -

            Sprinklers rain down on Frank as he moves down the hall.

            The coffee shop breaks into cheers.  Everyone screaming their

            complete and utter shock.  Julia looking at him
            questioningly.

            shoulders.  But someone is trying to get Satch's attention.
            It is the counter man, he's holding a phone.

            Satch takes the phone, beat, his face goes ashen.

            Frank quickly steps behind a pillar as Satch tears by him and
            up the stairs.

            Stay with Frank as he turns...calmly walking by the

            his notebook.  Flipping through pages.  Notes on Shepard:

            CLICK, CLICK -- dead bolt turning...

            Front door opens and SHEPARD WALKS IN.  His '69 apartment is
            far nicer than the place we just left John in '98.

            Shepard runs to the bathroom.  Rips off the toilet's tank
            lid, reaches down and pulls out a .357 Magnum Colt Python,
            wrapped in clear plastic.

            He rips off the plastic, shoves the pistol in his waistband,
            heads into the kitchen.

            He gropes behind the refrigerator, close on an envelope glass
            taped to back of the fridge.  Shepard's hand finds the
            envelope...he rips it loose.  And then he opens it -
            revealing its contents, souvenirs, POLAROID PHOTOS OF THE
<b>            NIGHTINGALE MURDERS, WOMEN'S JEWELRY, NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS...
</b>
            Shepard takes out a match to burn the photos.  But then...

            The broom closet door bursts off its hinges.  Frank instantly
            on top of Shepard.  The souvenirs go flying in the air.
            Frank pummels Shepard's head and back. But Shepard smashes
            his elbow in Frank's Adam's apple, lands a solid uppercut
            square on Frank's nose.  Frank's eyes watering up, VISION
<b>            BLURRING.
</b>
<b>            CLOSE ON

            Frank's hand, groping for the handle of a glass pitcher atop
            the kitchen counter.

            Shepard reaches for his gun, points the .357 at Frank's head.
            Shepard's finger squeezing the trigger. It's over.  But...

            FRANK SMASHES THE GLASS PITCHER down on Shepard's skull.
            Shepard drops.  CRACK, the gun fires, BLASTING AIR.

            FRANK scrambles for the window.  He's outta there, expertly
            thundering down fire escape.

<b>            EXT. ALLEY BEHIND SHEPARD'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

            Frank hits the pavement, twisting his ankle.  Hears metal
            rattling, looks up.  Shepard's clattering down after him.

            Shepard tries to get off a shot through the fire escape grid.
            BANG!  The shot ricochets wildly.  Frank takes off, limping
            and staying close to the building out of the line of fire.

            The streets are still empty, the city glued to their TV's.
            Frank hits CPW.  He glances left, right, straight ahead.
            Central Park.

            Frank runs into the park.

            The door is kicked open.  Satch and Phil enter, guns drawn.
            They take in the damage from the fight.  Following the trail
            of blood back to the kitchen. And there, strewn across the
            floor are Shepard's photos of his victims, the newspaper
            clippings, the jewelry, and the envelope with the glass tape
            still on it.

            Satch knows.

<b>            EXT. CENTRAL PARK BRIDGE - UNDER CONSTRUCTION - CONTINUOUS

            Frank hears pounding footsteps - Shepard is catching up.

            Frank's adrenaline kicking in, sprints around a bend in the
            path, reaches long wooden bridge spanning Central Park Lake.

            The bridge is being restored.  Barricades across the
            entrance.

            Frank hurdles over the barricades, runs onto the bridge.

            Shepard trips in the dirt.  Gets back up, reaches the bridge,
            knocks over a barricade, runs to the middle of the bridge.

            FRANK'S DISAPPEARED.  Shepard stops, listens - nothing.

<b>            EXT. CENTRAL PARK BRIDGE - UNDERNEATH - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Frank dangles below the bridge, holding onto the steel girder
            of substructure - 8 ft. above water.  Not moving a muscle,
            not making a sound, barely even breathing.

<b>            CLOSE ON SEWER RAT
</b>
            Crawling on Frank's arm.  Caught off guard, Frank flinches,
            sending the rat tumbling.

<b>            EXT. CENTRAL PARK BRIDGE - TOP OF BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Bridge side railings have been removed for construction.

            Shepard hears something hit the water.  Rushes to the side of
            the bridge, points his gun at the water.  BANG!

            Shepard leans out further aiming the gun at the water.
            Shepard's outstretched arm only a few feet from Frank's head.
            Frank silently swings his body forward reaching out...

            Snags Shepard's arm, pulling him hard, over the side.

            SHEPARD FALLS, grabs for something, anything.  Wraps his arms
            around Frank's leg, hangs on tight.

            Frank struggles, kicks wildly, trying to shake Shepard off.
            Shepard hangs on with his left arm.  Pulls out the gun with
            his right.  He aims it at Frank's head.  Cocks back the
            hammer.

            FRANK LETS GO.  KERPLUNK.  They plunge into:

<b>            EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LAKE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Murky water, thick with dirt and slime, 5' deep.

            Frank's hanging on to Shepard's arm, trying to wrestle the
            gun free.  But Shepard's using his free hand to gouge Frank's
            eyes.  Frank bites down hard on Shepard's wrist.

            The gun sinks silently to the muddy lake bottom.

            But Shepard gets both hands on Frank's throat.  Shoving his
            head into the shallow water.  Shepard's grip is like a vise,
            Frank futilely tries to pry Shepard's fingers open.

            Frank is blinded by polluted water.  Starting to lose
            consciousness.  Desperately, he searches the muddy lake
            bottom for the gun.  But he's getting weaker, fading out...

            Then he feels something.  A BRICK, fallen off the bridge,
            half buried in the mud.  Frank struggles to dig it up.
            Summons his last ounces of strength, yanking it back and
            forth, it's getting loose.

            But Shepard's hands are squeezing tighter.  Frank finally
            goes limp.  A few last bubbles float to the surface.  Shepard
            smiles.  Catching his breath, slightly loosens grip on
            Frank's lifeless neck.

            Frank springs off the lake bottom, rises out of the water
            like a jack-in-the-box.  Holding the brick with both hands,
            he swings.  CONTACT.

            The brick smashes against Shepard's head.  Knocking him to
            yesterday.  He drops like a rock.

            Frank waits for Shepard to come up for air.  Nothing.

            Frank crawls out of the water, collapsing onto the
            embankment.  He just lies there, heart pounding, chest
            heaving.

            And suddenly, Frank is startled by a MASSIVE ROAR - the sound
            of eight million New Yorkers screaming in unison.  The Mets
            have just won the World Series.

            Frank laughs, slowly getting to his feet.

            Frank's dripping blood and filthy lake water.  The streets

            party.  Cars whiz by, honking their horns, passengers leaning
            out, pumping fists in victory.  Frank has to yell above the

            An inflatable boat is being placed in the lake.  Two police
            frog men are climbing into their gear.

            Pan over the scene to find Frank and Satch.  Frank's got a
            blanket wrapped around him.  They talk quietly as Satch walks

<b>            INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Frank's wrists are bleeding.  He can't get out.  But then he
            sees something.  Something he can use.  His WATCH.  Frank
            struggles to unfasten the watch strap.  He does it.  He
            pinches the metal clasp with his thumb and forefinger and
            guides it to the keyhole in the left handcuff.  He works it.
            Nothing.  Then CLICK.  He's out!

<b>            INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT - 1998
</b>
            John Shepard fight furiously.  But John has managed to get
            control of the .45's TRIGGER.  He squeezes it.  BANG.
<b>            ANOTHER ONE.  BANG!  BANG!
</b>
<b>            INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT - 1969
</b>
            Shepard's hands are moving towards Julia's breasts.  SUDDENLY
            she lashes out, DIGGING HER NAILS DEEP INTO SHEPARD'S
<b>            FACE...TEARING FLESH, DRAWING BLOOD.
</b>
<b>            INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT - 1998
</b>
            CLOSE ON SHEPARD, struggling with John.  A LARGE SCAR ETCHES
            ONTO HIS FACE, in the exact spot where Julia dug her nails in
            29-years ago.  BANG!!  BANG!!

<b>            INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT - 1969
</b>
            Shepard grabs Julia by the throat.  Slams her against the
            wall, knocking her unconscious onto the shower floor.  He
            touches the GASH on his face, stares at the blood.

<b>            INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT - 1998
</b>
            BANG!  BANG!  John keeps squeezing that trigger.

            CLICK.  CLICK.  No more bullets.

            Shepard lets go of the gun, heave John over and grabs him by
            the neck...strangling him.

<b>            INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT - 1969
</b>
            Shepard is on top of Julia in the shower.  He uncoils the
            garrote, snaps it taut, and starts around her neck.

            And then a SOUND.  Instantly recognizable.  Beyond adequate
            description.  But once you've heard it, you don't forget
            it...

<b>            CHUUT, CHUUT, CHUUT: THE SOUND OF A 12-GUAGE PUMP-ACTION
</b><b>            SHOTGUN RATCHETING AROUND THE CORNER.
</b>
            Shepard's head spins about.

<b>            FRANK STANDS IN THE DOORWAY, SHOTGUN AIMED AT SHEPARD'S FACE.
</b>
<b>                                FRANK
</b>                      Get your fucking hands off my wife.

<b>                                SHEPARD
</b>                      Don't.  Don't do it, Frank.  You're not a
                      killer.

            He is right.  Frank hesitates.  Shepard LUNGES, grabbing the
            shotgun barrel.

            BOOM!  Frank FIRES.  BUCKSHOT RIPS THROUGH THE AIR.
            SHEPARD'S RIGHT HAND EXPLODES...blood spattering everywhere.

            Like a wounded animal, Shepard bolts, blowing past Frank.

            Frank gently wraps Julia in a towel.  The fading sound of
            Shepard thundering down the stairs.  Out the door.

            And then softer footsteps.  Coming closer.  Johnny appears in
            the doorway.  Safe and sound.

<b>            INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT - 1998
</b>
<b>            SHEPARD RIGHT HAND GOES LIMP AROUND JOHN'S NECK.  HE STARES
</b><b>            IN SHOCK AS HIS HAND BEGINS TO DISFIGURE.
</b>
            John starts to choke back to life...

            And then something happens.  Some kind of SHOCK-WAVE ripples
            through the house -- bending light - bizarrely distorting
            everything in its path, including Shepard and John.

            The shock-wave is over.  But the house is different.
            Changed.

            Shepard scans the changed room - disoriented, bewildered.
            CRASH!  John pounces.  Pounding blows to Shepard's head.

            John is on top of Shepard, hands on his neck.  As John
            squeezes the life out of him, Shepard struggles to reach down
            his leg with his good hand...

            There's something down there.  An ankle holster.  Shepard
            strains to get his hand on the gun.  He does.

            In a flash, Shepard has the gun to John's temple.

            CLICK.  Shepard cocks back the hammer.

<b>                                SHEPARD
</b>                      You were the kid.  I remember now.

            Keeping the gun pressed against John's temple, Shepard gets
            to his feet.

<b>                                SHEPARD (CONT'D)
</b>                      But this time, no Daddy.

            John closes his eyes.  It's over, he knows he's gonna die.

            SILENCE.  Then a sound.  A sound we've heard before.  A sound
            you never forget.  Music to our ears.

<b>            CHUUT, CHUUT, CLICK: THE SOUND OF A 12-GAUGE PUMP-ACTION
</b><b>            SHOTGUN RATCHETING A ROUND IN THE CHAMBER.
</b>
            Shepard looks up to see: MAN HOLDING SHOTGUN.

            B-O-O-O-M: SHOTGUN BLAST:  Buckshot ripping into Shepard.
            Impact lifting him off his feet.  He lands dead on the floor.

<b>            CLOSE ON JOHN'S FACE
</b>
            Opening his eyes.  Looking up at the doorway.  Blinking
            through shotgun smoke, trying to focus.  Not believing what
            he sees.

<b>            FRANK SULLIVAN - AGE SIXTY-NINE
</b>
            John looks up at his father, speechless.

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                      I'm still here, Chief.

<b>            EXT. LITTLE LEAGUE BASEBALL FIELD - MORNING - SOME YEARS
</b><b>            LATER
</b>
            We are soaring high above a baseball diamond.  Clear light
            air, you can see for miles.  Float down to the field...

            The first taste of Spring and Softball.  Picnic baskets.
            Flowers.  Kites flying.  Children running.

            The bleachers filled with families and loved ones.

            Among them sits SAMANTHA.  She's smiling, she's
            glowing...she's pregnant.  PULL BACK to reveal SATCH, GORDO,
            ELLEN &amp; GORDY JR.  A dalmation puppy scampers at their feet,
            barking in recognition as...

            Frank Sullivan steps into the batter's box.

<b>            CLOSE ON
</b>
            Pitcher: 22 year-old African-Amerasian, a muscular beanpole.
            Embroidered on the back of the his FDNY jersey is his
            nickname: PHIRE POWER.

            Quick shot of first baseman.  GRAHAM GIBSON - once a nervous
            PROBIE, now a seasoned vet.  And one hell of proud father.

<b>                                GIBSON
</b>                          (to pitcher)
                      Take it easy on him son, he's older than
                      Moses.

            Frank sneers at Gib, then glances up at GIB's WIFE in the
            bleachers.  She looks familiar, it's the girl Frank saved in
            the warehouse 29-years ago.

            PHIRE POWER twirls his arm...

            Frank takes a big swing...contact...the ball fouls back
            behind the plate.  Towards the parking lot.  Where among the
            old Chevys and Fords sits a brand new MERCEDES.  The custom
            license plate reads: YAHOO.

            CRASH!  Frank's foul ball comes down hard.  As the Mercedes'
            windshield spiderwebs we hear an off-camera scream...

            It is Gordo, jumping up, running across the field.  From the
            parking lot his eyes meet Frank's.  An I'M SORRY shrug, and
            Frank turns his attention back to the game.

            The next pitch is high and outside.

            Frank takes a looping swing...driving the ball to the gap in
            right center.  Frank jogs to first.  An easy single.

            From first, Frank glances over at the third base coach:
            JULIA.  Her hair pinned up under a Mets cap, Julia puts two
            fingers in her mouth and belts out a loud whistle as...

            The next batter steps out of the dugout.  It is John
            Sullivan.

<b>            CLOSE ON
</b>
            John as he makes his way to the plate.

            Check out his eyes: they're different, he looks like his
            father.  They've got that Frank Sullivan sparkle.

            John steps into the batter's box, cocks back to wood.

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                      Bring me home, son!  Bring me home!

            PHIRE POWER uncorks the fastest softball pitch you've ever
            seen.  John jumps on it.  Rips a massive shot to deep center,
            way over the fence.

            The crew in the stands are on their feet, cheering.

            Frank rounds third, John catches up.  A double high-five from
            Julia and they jog home together.  The game is over.

            Frank puts his arm around John.  Heading for the bleachers.

            A little boy totters up to them.  Jumping into John's arms.
            His name is Frank Jr.

<b>                                JOHN
</b>                      Hey there, Chief.

            John gives his son a kiss, glances up at Samantha in the
            bleachers.   They share a smile.  And as they step off the
            field, his little boy reaches up, takes John's hat off his
            head and puts it on his own...

<b>                                FRANK JR.
</b>                      Elvis has left the building...

<b>            CLOSE ON
</b>
            John's face.  In his eyes, bliss.

            CUE Bruce Springsteen's: TAKE ME OUT TO THE BALLGAME.

            Archival film footage.  1969 World Series.  Game Five.  The
            last pitch.  Mets win.  Shea stadium erupts.  Fans stream
            onto the field.  Lifting the players on their heads.
            The madness continues for a while, then slowly fade to Fifth
            Ave.  Mets' ticker tape parade.  It's a hell of a party.
