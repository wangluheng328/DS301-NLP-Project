Kip Raines, a young car thief, was contracted to steal 50 specific cars but something went wrong.
Now the man who hired him, Raymond Calitri, wants his head.
When his brother, Memphis, once a great car thief, who retired a few years ago, learns of this, he comes back to town to see if he can help his brother.
The only thing that will appease Calitri is if the order is fulfilled.
So Memphis has to assemble his old crew, and he has to do the job in a few days.
And a cop who hounded him, upon learning of his return, is keeping an eye on him.
And another car thief, whom he competed with before wants to get the Calitri job, and is telling Memphis to back off, but he won't.
