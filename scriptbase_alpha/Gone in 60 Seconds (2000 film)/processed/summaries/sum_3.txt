Legendary car thief/booster Randall "Memphis" Raines retired from the criminal life in 1994.
Now six years later after Auto Theft in the greater Los Angeles/Long Beach district went down by 47%, his brother, Kip Raines takes over "the job", employed by British car broker Raymond Calitri.
When one night Kip messes up stealing some cars, Memphis gets called back to the life he got out of.
His most impossible mission: Steal 50 exotic cars all over Los Angeles and Long Beach in just one night and deliver them to Long Beach Harbor, Pier 14 by 8:00am, Friday morning, on the button, or never see his brother again.
And so Memphis and Kip, with the help of longtime friend Otto Halliwell reassembles his old crew which includes sexy Sara "Sway" Wayland", a renegade white-haired mechanic by day, bartender by night, to pull off the biggest mission ever.
The only problem is the LAPD G.R.A.B.
(Governor's Regional Auto-Theft Bureau).
It's on the lookout and Det.
Roland Castlebeck and his partner, Det.
Drycoff are keeping close eyes on Memphis and his team.
Can the team pull this assignment off and collect $200,000 in cash?
Will Kip finally realize that car boosting is dangerous?
And can Memphis escape Castlebeck and the cops?
It's a long shot and it's going to be one hell of a long night, but they may have a chance.
Cut to the chase.
