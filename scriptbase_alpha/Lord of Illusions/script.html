<b>	TITLE SEQUENCE
</b>

	As the credits run, we INTERCUT the following two sequences:


<b>	EXT. NEVADA DESERT - IDOLS - DAY
</b>

	A SLOW DRIFT through a collection of crudely constructed,
	surreal, six-foot tall "IDOLS."  Like modern demons. 
	Grotesque.  Disturbing. WE LAP DISSOLVE between details of
	their twisted anatomies:  headlamp eyes, bright metal claws,
	broken glass teeth.

<b>	EXT. NEVADA ROADS - DESERT - DAY
</b>
	Two vehicles, one a Volkswagen "bus" decorated with stylized
	flames, the other a '66 Thunderbird, speeding along a series
	of eerily empty desert roads, somewhere in a wilderness of
	sand and heat.

<b>	END CREDITS.
</b>
<b>				CUT WIDE TO;
</b>
<b>	EXT. NEVADA DESERT - DAY
</b>
	A violent WIND HOWLS around, but through the sand we-can just
	make out a large, ominous building:  the HOUSE of William
	Nix.  Its walls are white-washed and scrawled with GRAFFITI. 
	The "family" of IDOLS surrounds the doorway, guarding it. ON
	SCREEN, the words:  '"Nevada - Thirteen Years Ago"

<b>	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
	We're at the front door now, which stands open.  Leaning
	against the door-frame is a scrawny, wild-eyed YOUTH, about
	sixteen.  His name is BUTTERFIELD.  He's got a brooding,
	almost sultry look on his face.  One of his eyes is black,
	the other milky blue.  He's whittling something with a
	scalpel. Distantly, the sound of CAR ENGINES.  Butterfield
	narrows his eyes.

<b>	BUTTERFIELD'S P.O.V.
</b>
	The Volkswagen "bus" and Thunderbird are approaching the
	house.

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>			(softly)
		Swann...?

	He turns from the door.  In his haste he drops the WOOD he's
	whittling.  He's been carving a DEATH'S HEAD.

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - ROOMS AND CORRIDORS - DAY
</b>
	The house no longer serves any domestic function.  It has
	become the temple and dormitory of Nix's small apocalyptic
	cult.  As we go through the house with Butterfield we glimpse
	a little of what life here is like. 

	The rooms are murky, and chaotic.  The walls, PAINTED with
	scenes of cities and landscapes BURNING, and creatures from
	some unspeakable nightmare ATTACKING, RAPING, and DEVOURING
	helpless humanity.  The atmosphere is joyless, and
	oppressive. 

	The passages become progressively darker as the boy makes his
	way to the heart of the house.  Only OIL LAMPS, set on the
	floor, light these claustrophobic corridors.

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		Master?

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - DAY
</b>
	A dozen CULTISTS sit cross-legged on the floor in front of
	their leader, WILLIAM NIX.  His black hair grows to his
	shoulders.  His eyes are deep and glittering, his voice
	seductive.  A terrifying yet charismatic presence. 

	All the Cultists - who are a cross-section of obsessives -
	wear the same simple T-shirts, painted with the cult's SIGIL. 
	They watch Nix in adoration. 

	As Nix speaks, he juggles a FLAME, passing it from hand to
	hand with casual ease...

<b>				NIX
</b>		And the fire said to me:  Nix, Nix,
		you're my instrument. From now on,
		you'll be called the Puritan...

<b>				CULTISTS
</b>			(murmuring)
		Puritan...

	NIX You will find a few good men and women, and together,
	together you will cleanse the world.

<b>				CULTISTS
</b>		Yes...

	Butterfield enters. 

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		Master?

	Nix looks up.

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		Swann's here. 

	Nix rises, smiling.

<b>				NIX
</b>			(to Cultists)
		We'll come back to this. Get about
		your business. 

	As the Cultists disperse, Nix and Butterfield exit into

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY
</b>
	A place of nightmares. Hanging from the middle of the ceiling
	is another grotesque SCULPTURE, three times the bulk of a
	large man, and made of metal, fly-blown animal parts and
	knotted rope.  It is vaguely cruciform, but its swaying,
	creaking bulk is not even faintly Christian.  It is a
	perverse, sickening image, evoking insanity and agony.

	From the shadows in the corner, we hear a young girl's soft
<b>	SOBBING.
</b>
<b>				NIX
</b>		Hush...

	Nix goes to the GIRL.  She is twelve; beautiful, blonde, and
	presently in a state of mortal fear.  She sits, bound, in a
	fetal position, her face soaked with SWEAT and TEARS, her
	mouth BLOODIED, her cheek BRUISED.

<b>				NIX
</b>		I said hush.

<b>				GIRL
</b>		Please.  Let me go.

	From the opposite corner the SCREECH of Nix's pet BABOON. 
	Nix goes to it.  The animal is large and lethal.

<b>				NIX
</b>			(to Baboon)
		What is it?

	The Baboon pulls on its chain, staring at the Girl and baring
	its teeth as it screeches.

<b>				NIX
</b>			(to Girl)
		I think he's in love.

	He unshackles the Baboon.  The animal pads toward the Girl,
	trailing its chain.

<b>				GIRL
</b>		Keep it away from me.

	Nix catches hold of its chain.  Holds it back.  The Baboon
	starts screeching again, scrabbling at the Girl, its NAILS
	catching her arms and legs, drawing BLOOD.

<b>				GIRL
</b>		Please... please...

	Nix watches her terror dispassionately.

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>			(also watching, wide-
		eyed)
		Want me to shoot Swann?

<b>				NIX
</b>		You don't like him, do you?

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		He wants your magic.

<b>				NIX
</b>		Maybe.  Go fetch him.

	Butterfield exits.  Nix advances on the Girl.

<b>				GIRL
</b>		What are you going to do?

<b>				CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DESERT - DAY
</b>
	The two vehicles come to a halt outside Nix's house.

	From the Thunderbird steps PHILIP SWANN, a nineteen- year-old
	with shoulder-length hair and brilliant blue eyes.  He's not
	conventionally handsome, but he's certainly striking. 

	From the passenger seat steps CASPAR QUAID, a black man,
	studious and intense.  From the bus emerges MURRAY PIMM,
	skinny and jittery, and JENNIFER DESIDERIO, a woman with a
	steely gaze.

<b>				SWANN
</b>			(to all three)
		Are we ready?

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>			(cool)
		Say the word.

<b>				PIMM
</b>			(very nervous)
		Look, maybe we should think this over.

	On Swann, as he brings from his car three very bizarre pieces
	of METALWORK.  We get only a tantalizing glimpse of them, as
	he slips them into his pocket.

<b>				SWANN
</b>		No.  He's gone too far.

<b>				PIMM
</b>		So he took a child.

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>		He'll kill her.

<b>				PIMM
</b>		No he won't.

<b>				SWANN
</b>			(determined)
		He's not going to get the chance.

	Quaid checks a gun, then slips it into his belt.

<b>				QUAID
</b>		If he gets in our fucking heads he'll drive us crazy.

<b>				SWANN
</b>		So stay out here.

	Swann starts towards the House.  Jennifer is the first to
	follow, with the other two on her heels.

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
	Butterfield comes to the door, as Swann steps inside.

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		He's expecting you.

	Behind Swann, Quaid and Pimm exchange nervous looks.

<b>				SWANN
</b>			(to others)
		Look around.  If you find 'the
		child, yell.  She's got blonde
		hair, that's all I know.

	Butterfield turns away, smiling to himself.  Swann follows
	him.

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - "MEDITATION" ROOM - DAY
</b>
	Quaid looks into a large circular room where FIVE CULTISTS
	(three men and two women) still sit.  One of the women is
	breast-feeding a baby.

<b>				1ST MAN
</b>		Hey, Quaid.  I thought you said you
		weren't coming back.

<b>				QUAID
</b>		I changed my mind.

<b>				1ST WOMAN
</b>		Come and join us.

	She smiles a crazy smile.  Reaches out for Quaid.  A SNAKE
	appears from around the back of her neck.  Quaid recoils. 

	And now we see that there are snakes everywhere.  In the
	Cultists' clothes and hair.  Even on the baby.  Quaid turns
	away.  And - shock! - there's a SNAKE on the door frame,
	winding around his hand.  He strikes it to the ground, and
	drives his heel down on its head.

<b>				SNAKE-HANDLER CULTIST
</b>			(angry)
		Don't do that!

	The Snake-Handler gets up.  Quaid retreats from the door. 
	Snake-Handler picks up the dead snake and, lifting it above
	his head, dribbles its BLOOD onto his face.

<b>	INT.   NIX'S  HOUSE  -   "BEDROOM"   -  DAY
</b>
	Jennifer enters a gloomy room.  She goes to a mattress where
	a BLONDE GIRL lies with her bare back to us.

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>		Don't be afraid.

	The Blonde Girl, BARBARA, turns over.  She has a dirty cloth
	pressed to a wound between her breasts.  It is not the Girl,
	of course.  She stares up at Jennifer, clearly drugged.

<b>				BARBARA
</b>		I'm not... want to see?

	She pulls the cloth away.  She has carved the cult SIGIL into
	her FLESH.  The BLOODY KNIFE lies beside her. Jennifer
	retreats to the door, and exits back out into --

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY
</b>
	Pimm is standing against the wall, clutching a CRUCIFIX. He
	is ashen with terror.  Jennifer snatches the crucifix from
	his white-knuckled fingers.

<b>				PIMM
</b>		He's going to kill us all...

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>		Where did Swann go?

	Pimm points down the passageway towards Nix's room.

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY OUTSIDE NIX'S SANCTUM - DAY
</b>
	Swann wipes sweat from his upper lip, then reaches down to
	his belt, to check the GUN tucked out of sight at his side. 
	He turns the door handle.

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY
</b>
	Swann steps inside.  Nix's chair has its back to him. The
	folds of Nix's robe are visible, however.  Swann hears a
	muffled SOBBING from the far side of the room. 

	On the Girl, now gagged and lying amongst bones and filth.

	Swann starts towards her, his footsteps barely audible.  As
	he approaches the chair - the Baboon leaps at him screeching!

	He reaches for his gun.  The chair topples.  The Baboon, half
	dressed in Nix's robes, bounds towards Swann. 

	Swann FIRES at it.  The bullet blasts off half its head.

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY
</b>
	On Quaid, who draws his GUN as three CULTISTS appear in the
	passageway that leads to Nix's Sanctum.

<b>				QUAID
</b>		Stay the fuck away!
			(yells)
		Pimm!  Get over here!

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY
</b>
	PAN UP from the twitching Baboon corpse to Swann as he
	struggles with the Girl's gag.  He has laid his gun on the
	ground beside her.

<b>				SWANN
</b>		You're going to be okay.

	Out of focus, behind him, the cruciform sculpture swings
	round.  Nix is hanging on it, like an idol on a grotesque
	altarpiece. 

	The Girl sees Nix over Swann's shoulder.  Terror crosses her
	face.  Swann turns.

<b>				NIX
</b>		I knew you'd come. 

	He reaches down to Swann.

<b>				NIX
</b>		I've got so much power to give
		you, Swann.  All you have to do
		is...beg.

<b>				SWANN
</b>		Fuck you.

<b>				NIX
</b>		You don't think I've got it to
		give?

<b>				SWANN
</b>		No!

	Suddenly. Nix swoops down on Swann. apparently defying
	gravity.

<b>				NIX
</b>		You're wrong.

	He catches hold of Swann with one hand and drives him back
	against the wall.

<b>				NIX
</b>		I could eat your fucking soul,
		Swann.

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY
</b>
	Jennifer, reaches the door of the Sanctum.  Butterfield steps
	from the shadows.  His KNIFE flashes as it strikes Jennifer's
	hand.  BLOOD SPURTS.

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>		Fuck!

	She retreats, staunching her bleeding hand.

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY
</b>
	Nix has Swann trapped against the wall and is working his
	fingers against Swann's temples.  Working, working, like a
	psychic surgeon plying against the belly of a patient.

<b>				NIX
</b>		You want to know what the world
		really looks like?

	Swann struggles, but he can't get free of Nix's hold. 

	And now -- horribly -- Nix's fingers slide beneath the skin
	of Swann's temples, without a drop of blood being spilt.

<b>				NIX
</b>		Want to see flesh with a god's
		eyes?

	Swann SCREAMS as Nix's mind-hold seizes him.

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY
</b>
	Quaid levels his gun at Butterfield, who is guarding the
	Sanctum door.  Jennifer is at Quaid's side.

<b>				SWANN (V.O.)
</b>		Aah!

<b>				QUAID
</b>		Get away from the door!

	Butterfield shakes his head.  Quaid FIRES.  The bullet.
	strikes the wall beside Butterfield's head.  He retreats,
	growling like a rabid animal.  Quaid kicks the Sanctum door
	open, and enters.

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY
</b>
<b>				QUAID
</b>		Swann?

<b>				NIX
</b>			(to Quaid)
		Here he is.

	Swann stumbles into the middle of the room, the whites of his
	eyes blood-red.

<b>				NIX
</b>		Take a look, Swann!  These are your
		friends.

	On Swann, reeling like a drunkard as he looks up at Quaid and
	Jennifer.

<b>				JENNIFER (V.O.)
</b>		What have you done to him? 

<b>SWANN'S P.O.V.
</b>
	of Quaid and Jennifer.  To Swann's eyes, their faces seem to
	be MORPHING.  Their humanity is MELTING AWAY. What's left is
	like a jellyfish with black, soulless eyes:  PRIMEVAL MUCK.

</b>		Swann.  It's okay.

	Quaid reaches for Swann, who retreats in horror, shaking his
	head violently.

<b>				SWANN
</b>		Don't touch me.  He's got... got
		into my head.

<b>				NIX
</b>		You want to be like that, Swann? 
		Mud and shit?

	Swann turns away from Quaid and Jennifer in disgust.

<b>	SWANN'S P.O.V. 
</b>
	of Nix, his arms outstretched in welcome.  His face has an
	aura of pulsing light.

<b>				NIX
</b>		Come here.  Share the power.

	ON a GUN, leveled. .We don't see by whom.  The trigger is
	pulled. 

	The bullet strikes Nix's back and explodes out of his chest.

	ON SWANN, staring at Nix. 

	SWANN'S P.O.V. of Nix, as the aura of light dies. 

	Just for a moment - a terrible moment - Swann glimpses
	something else. MORPHING out of Nix's features.  A NIGHTMARE
	FACE with waves of DARKNESS emanating from the middle of its
	forehead. 

	Swann covers his eyes.

<b>				NIX
</b>			(raging, terrifying)
		Swann!  Swann!

	Nix staggers, letting out an ungodly HOWL, and drops to his
	knees, clutching the WOUND.  As he falls, he reveals the
	ashen Girl, who is still holding Swann's smoking GUN.

<b>				NIX

		Help me!

	Swann shakes his head, ridding himself of Nix's mind-
	control.

	On Nix, doing just that:  rising up.  Right hand clamped to
	his bloody chest, left hand reaching for Swann.

<b>				NIX
</b>		Help me!

	Quaid FIRES at him again. Strikes his shoulder.  And again. 
	Strikes his leg.  Nix collapses to the ground,

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>		Quickly!

	They have come prepared for this.  Swann now takes from his
	jacket the three strange pieces of METALWORK.  There are
	SCREWS in then all.

<b>				NIX
</b>			(seeing)
		Swann?  What are you doing?

<b>				SWANN
</b>		Binding you.

	He clamps one of the pieces over Nix's EYES.  It fits like an
	eyeless mask.  Nix thrashes and SCREAMS.  Swann lays his
	hands on the side of the mask, and — LIKE MAGIC -- his touch
	makes the screws tighten of their own accord, grinding into
	Nix's flesh and bone with a gut- wrenching SOUND.  BLOOD runs
	from the screw-holes.

<b>				NIX
</b>		Fuck you, Swann!  Fuck you!

	Now the second piece, over his MOUTH.

<b>				NIX
</b>		Sw—

	He's silenced.  The piece screws itself into-his head, like
	the first.  And now comes the third and final piece:  over
	the nose and into the ears.  Again, it screws itself into
	place. 

	Swann has done all he can.  He retreats from Nix's body, as
	it continues to convulse.  We go from face to ashen face, as
	each man and woman watches and waits.  Why won't he die? 

	And now, at last  the violence of Nix's death-throes
	diminishes.  Nix's body bends like a bow, arching off the
	ground, and with one last, terrible spasm, he dies.

<b>				GIRL
</b>			(quietly)
		Is it finished?

<b>				SWANN
</b>		It's finished.

	The Cultists' faces slacken, as though some mental hold Nix
	had upon them has disappeared.  Then they start to retreat,
	their confidence and courage gone. 

	Pimm steps into the Sanctum.

	A large deteriorating mural of Hollywoodland, depicting a

	At the front desk - with his back to us at present - stands
	HARRY D'AMOUR.  He is having difficulty getting the pretty

	handsome, unshaven, 35-ish, with an open easy smile.

	ON TAPERT, a middle-aged, balding man with a very pretty
	WOMAN opposite him, sitting at a table close to the window. 
	Tapert makes a joke (unheard).  The woman laughs. 

	ON HARRY, chewing on a hamburger, as he speaks into his tape

	WE PAN OFF the door as Harry's car comes to a halt on the far

	Harry gets out of the car.  Stares at the sign in the window,
	puzzled.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Superstitious?

	He starts across the street.  Suddenly:

<b>				TAPERT (V.O.)
</b>		Oh my God!

	Tapert emerges, his face white with terror.  He stumbles to
	his car, and he's away.  Harry freezes, caught between the
	need to follow Tapert and sheer curiosity. He gives in to the
	latter, and steps inside.

<b>	INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - STAIRWELL - NIGHT
</b>
	An illuminated ARROW points up the stairs.  Harry ascends,
	past faded PHOTOGRAPHS of Caspar Quaid with famous faces.

	At the landing, the passageway turns ninety degrees. Harry
	halts, and takes out his GUN. 

	There's a strange RUMBLING SOUND approaching from round the
	corner.  Harry chances a look.  There's a short length of
	passageway, leading to an open door.  From the threshold a
	CRYSTAL BALL rolls towards Harry, BLOOD- SMEARED.  This is
	the source of the rumbling.  Harry stops the ball before it
	falls down the stairs. 

	Dead silence.  After a beat, Harry creeps towards the open
	door.  He pushes it open.  Inside, chaos.  The fake antique
	FURNITURE is splintered, the ASTRAL CHARTS slashed.

<b>	INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - WAITING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	There are two offices.  In the front, a Waiting Room, into
	which Harry now steps.  Beyond it, through a door that stands
	narrowly ajar, the Fortune Telling Room. 

	From out of the Fortune Telling Room, a MOAN.

<b>				QUAID (V.O.)
</b>		Ahh. . .

	Harry crosses the Waiting Room, reaching into his jacket for
	his gun.  Suddenly, a nightmarish FIGURE leaps from the
	shadows. 

	His name is RAY MILLER.  He's as crazy as a rabid dog, teeth
	sharpened, eyes wild.  Nix's SIGIL is tattooed on the middle
	of his forehead.  He STRIKES the GUN from Harry's hand and
	goes for his throat. 

	Harry reaches out behind him, picks up a phrenologist's BUST
	and SMASHES it on Miller's skull. 

	Miller reels back.  Harry makes a dash for the door to the
	Fortune Telling Room.

<b>				MILLER
</b>		Fuckhead.

<b>	INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - FORTUNE-TELLING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	A mysterious, candle-lit space.  In the middle of the room, a
	table.  At it sits Quaid. thirteen years older. He has been
	tortured close to death.  Several small SCALPELS protrude
	from his chest and neck.  His life is ebbing away.  On the
	table in front of him, a fan of TAROT CARDS, BLOOD-SPATTERED.

	Harry races in through the open door from the Waiting Room.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		What the fuck!?

	Harry picks up the PHONE.  It's dead.  Miller charges at the
	door.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Shit!

	Harry SLAMS the door in Miller's face, and locks it. 

	As he does so, the candles FLICKER.  Harry looks up.  A
	FIGURE looms from the darkness behind Quaid.  He's in his
	late twenties:  an androgynous, disturbing sight. His long
	hair is drawn back into a pony-tail.  His mismatched eyes -
	one black, one milky blue, tell us that he is Butterfield. 
	His hands are BLOODY, and he carries one last SCALPEL.

<b>				HARRY
</b>			(to Butterfield)
		Don't touch him."

	Butterfield strokes the wounds on Quaid's cheek.  Quaid sobs
	in pain. 

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		What are you going to do about it? 

	Miller's hand tears at the wood around the lock from the
	other side.  His fingers appear, scrabbling to tear the lock
	out.  Harry doesn't move, or Miller will be through.

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>			(to Harry)
		Ever watched a man die?  If you
		watch very closely, you can
		sometimes see the soul escaping. 
		And if you're very quick, you can
		catch it.

<b>				QUAID
</b>		Please... Butterfield... I wasn't
		there.  Ask Pimm.

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's
		disappeared.  They knew the Puritan
		was coming home. 

	As this exchange goes on, Miller pulls the lock out of the
	door and starts to THROW HIMSELF against it from the other
	side.  It's all Harry can do to keep himself from being
	pitched across the room.  He looks around for some means of
	defense.  There's a crack in the drapes to the left of the
	table.  Behind it a WINDOW.

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		So do you.  You've seen the future. 
		Haven't you?

<b>				QUAID
</b>		Yes.

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		And are you afraid?

<b>				QUAID
</b>		Yes.

	Suddenly, Harry steps aside.  The door's flung open. Miller
	CHARGES in.  Harry catches hold of his arm, and THROWS him
	against the drape.  The window CRACKS; the drape comes down
	around Miller.  Amber STREETLIGHT floods in. 

	Butterfield is momentarily distracted.  Harry STRIKES the
	scalpel from his hands. 

	Miller, meanwhile, is struggling to free himself from the
	folds of the drapes.  Harry lands a solid KICK to the man's
	belly.  Miller is THROWN back against the cracked window,
	which SHATTERS.  Still wrapped in the drape, he FALLS OUT. 

	Harry turns back to arrest Butterfield, but he's already
	making his escape.  Harry starts after him.

<b>				QUAID
</b>			(to Harry)
		Don't leave me.

	He turns back.  TEARS are pouring down the man's face. Harry
	goes back to comfort Quaid, as Butterfield escapes down the
	stairs.


<b>				HARRY
</b>		You need an ambulance.

<b>				QUAID
</b>			(in pain)
		Too late.  Why are you here? Did
		you cone... up here for a reading? 

	Quaid takes hold of Harry's hand.

<b>				HARRY
</b><b>		NO ... I...
</b>
	Quaid stares at Harry's HAND.  Fascinated, he momentarily
	forgets his pain.  He traces the lines with bloody fingers.

<b>				QUAID
</b>			(quietly)
		My God.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		What?

<b>				QUAID
</b>		You've taken some strange
		journeys in your life.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Yeah.  You could say that.

<b>				QUAID
</b>		You're drawn to the dark side, over
		and over.  And it's drawn to you.
			(looks at Harry)
		You don't like that.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Not much.

<b>				QUAID
</b>		You can't change it.  You have to
		walk...
			(coughs)
		...walk the line between Heaven and
		Hell.  It's your destiny.  Accept
		it.

	Harry takes his hand from Quaid's grip.  Quaid winces in
	pain.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Hold on.

<b>				QUAID
</b>		I'm not afraid to die.  There's
		something terrible... coming
		home...

<b>				HARRY
</b>		The Puritan?

<b>				QUAID
</b>		Yes...

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Who is he? 

	Quaid shudders, and dies.

<b>				HARRY
</b>			(softly; sadly)
		Shit.

	He looks away, down at the CARDS.  All have been turned over
	but ONE.  He turns it.  The card is the Ten of Swords which
	pictures a prostrate man against a thunderous sky, pierced by
	all ten swords.  An image of death and desolation.

<b>	EXT. QUAID'S OFFICES - ALLEY BEHIND BUILDING - NIGHT

	The flashing LIGHTS of two patrol cars illuminate the scene. 
	DETECTIVE EDDISON, a surfer-turned-policeman with buzz-cut
	blond hair, heads along the alley with Harry.  He's midway
	through taking Harry's statement. There are already two
	OFFICERS examining the drapes.  We can't yet see the body.

<b>				EDDISON
</b>			(to Harry)
		What were you doing up there?

<b>				HARRY
</b>		I'm a private detective.  I was
		hired to follow somebody for a few
		days.  A guy called Tapert.
		Insurance fraud.

<b>				EDDISON
</b>			(writing)
		Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert,
		Butterfield.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Tapert's got nothing to do with
		this.  He came here to get his palm
		read.

<b>				EDDISON
</b>		What makes you so sure?

<b>				HARRY
</b>			(shrugs)
		I got a file on him two inches
		thick.  He's a petty fraudster.
		This is something else.  Ever heard
		of someone called the Puritan?

<b>				EDDISON
</b>		New one on me.
			(to Officer)
		Okay.  Let's see him.

	OFFICER #l shakes his head, and opens up the drape. Broken
	GLASS drops from the folds, but that's all. Miller has gone.

<b>				EDDISON
</b>		Where the fuck is he?

<b>				HARRY
</b>		He got up and walked.

</b>			(looking up at window)

	Butterfield sits beside the window, obsessively combing his
	long hair.  There is something feminine about him now:  his
	voice a whisper, his stare distracted.  If we didn't guess it
	already, we're in the presence of a madman. 

	Miller is squatting against the wall, picking shards of GLASS
	out of his torso.  It hurts, but he's enjoying himself.

</b>		I know him.  I saw him.

</b>		Higher.  Another inch.  The left
		hand side's too low.

	Dorothea descends the stairs, dressed for the day.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		Valentin?

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>			(to Hangers)
		Good.  There.
			(to Dorothea)
		Yes?

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>			(gives him the newspaper)
		You saw this?

	Valentin nods.  They walk back through the house together,
	while the picture-hanging goes on behind them.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		I want you to find this man D'Amour
		for me.

	She passes the newspaper to Valentin.  He looks down at it.

	Harry is sprawled on the bed, in his under shorts.  A shaft of
	sun darts between the drapes, missing his face by inches. 

	Somebody is knocking on the door, hard.

<b>				HARRY
</b>			(waking)
		What...?

	He rolls over.  The sun strikes his eyes.  He winces.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Shit.

<b>				VALENTIN (V.O.)
</b>		Mr. D'Amour?

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Go away.

<b>				VALENTIN (V.O.)
</b>		It's one in the afternoon.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		What are you, my mother?

<b>				VALENTIN (V.O.)
</b>		I need to speak to you, Mr.
		D'Amour.  About last night.

	Harry gets up and stumbles to the door.  He opens it a
	little.  The face of VALENTIN is visible through the crack.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Whatever I said, I didn't mean it,
		okay?  I get a few drinks inside me --

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		We've never met.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Then what do you want?

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		I'm here to offer you a job.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		I'm going back to New York in--
			(consults his watch)
		Shit!  I'm outta here.

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>			(sparring)
		Maybe I just bought it.

</b>		Somebody's been smoking in here for

	He pulls open the ashtray. Pulls out a cigar-butt.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Havanas.  You're not the

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>			(laughs)
		You could almost pass for a

		I work for the best illusionist in

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Philip Swann?

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		You know of him?

<b>				HARRY
</b>		I saw him in Vegas once.

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		Are you a gambling man?

<b>				HARRY
</b>		When I can afford to lose. Swann's
		quite a magician.

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		Never call him that.  He's strictly
		an illusionist.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		What's the difference?

</b>		Illusions are trickery. Magicians

	The sedan turns into a driveway.

<b>	EXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - DAY

	The sun beats down on a pristine panorama of palms and white
	marble tombs.  Harry and Valentin walk towards a large
	mausoleum.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Any movie stars buried here?

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		Probably.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		It's not a bad place.  Warm.
		Great view.

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		I don't think the dead much care.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Are you sure?

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		Are you a believer, then?

	Valentin gives him an inquisitive look.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		I've signed on for them all in my
		time.  Hindu.  Catholic. You can't
		have too many saviours.

	Harry's gaze is on the mausoleum now; or rather on the woman
	in white standing in its cool shadows:  Dorothea Swann.  She
	wears a wide-brimmed hat.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Who is she?

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		Swann's wife.

	VALENTIN sitting on the mausoleum steps reading a book.  He

	Harry and Dorothea are wandering between the graves, deep in
	conversation.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		I want you to help me help my
		husband.  I know he's in some kind
		of trouble.  And it's something to
		do with the man you saw murdered.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Did your husband know Quaid?

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		Yes.  They weren't close, but they
		saw each other once in a while.  I
		think Philip believes all that
		stuff with the tarot cards.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		You don't?

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		I think we make our own futures.

	Harry makes an approving MURMUR.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		What's the connection?

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>			(covering now, but well)
		I don't exactly know. 
		Philip doesn't like to talk about
		the past.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Why not?

	Dorothea stops talking.  Takes off her sunglasses.  Her gaze
	is troubled, but direct.  There is an attraction between the
	two of them that simmers beneath the dialogue.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		He's a secretive man.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		And you don't ask questions?

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		We don't share our lives the way a
		lot of people do.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Does that mean...?

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		We haven't slept in the same bed
		for years.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		But obviously you still care what
		happens to him.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		We wouldn't be having this
		conversation if I didn't. Swann's
		one of the most remarkable men
		alive.

	Harry, frowns.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		You don't believe me.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		He's an illusionist.  It's not
		exactly brain surgery. 

	Dorothea stares at him. 

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Sorry.  You asked.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		No.  You're right.  He could have
		been something more. Maybe a lot
		more.  But people get lost.  Even
		good people. Too much fame.  Too
		much money,

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Where do I sign? 

	Dorothea LAUGHS lightly.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Harry.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		Harry.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		I'm no bodyguard.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		That's not what I'm asking for. I
		want somebody who can find out what
		Philip saw in those damn cards. 
		And stop it from happening.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		When do you want me to start?

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		Come to the show with me. Tonight I
		want you to see him with an
		audience.  They love him.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Do you?

	The question catches Dorothea off guard.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		I didn't marry him for love, Mr.
		D'Amour.  Tonight?

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Sure.

	Dorothea makes a little smile, and walks away.  Harry watches

</b>
	CRANE DOWN from a looming STANDEE of Swann, perched above the
	theatre marquee.  SPOTLIGHTS rake the skies. The sidewalk
	below is jammed with AUDIENCE MEMBERS, STAR-SPOTTERS and
	PHOTOGRAPHERS.  This is a flashy, prestigious event.  LIMOS
	are disgorging scantily- dressed STARLETS and smiling MONEY
	MEN; a NEWS TEAM is interviewing audience members as they
	file in. 

	The atmosphere is noisy and excited.  Amid the throng, Harry. 
	He makes his way inside.

<b>	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
</b>
	The atmosphere, is closer to a rock concert than a
	conventional stage show.  Security people with walkie-
	talkies roam the aisles; the audience buzzes with barely
	controlled hysteria. 

	Harry heads down the aisle, eyes on the stage.  A star-lit
	CURTAIN covers it.  Six rows from the stage is Dorothea,
	already in her seat.  She smiles lavishly, happy to see him.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		I'm glad you could make it. 

	Harry takes a seat beside her.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Hey, this is a big deal for me. You
		know what seats like this cost in
		New York?

<b>	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - NIGHT
</b>
	Center-stage, behind the closed curtains, Swann is ready for
	the opening of the show.  TECHNICIANS buzz around him like
	flies.

<b>				SWANN
</b>		Valentin!

	Valentin emerges from the wings, patting the PANTHER that is
	waiting there.

<b>				SWANN
</b>			(irritated)
		Valentin!

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		I'm here.

<b>				SWANN
</b>		The guy with Dorothea.  Is that who
		I think it is? 

	Valentin nods.

	ON SWANN, his expression unreadable.

<b>				SWANN
</b>		He's young.

	MUSIC strikes up.  A dramatic, Wagnerian chord. Valentin
	hurries away.  Swann's expression becomes very focused.

<b>				1ST TECHNICIAN
</b>			(to Swann)
		Ready?

<b>				SWANN
</b>		Ready.

	Swann rises up into the flies.

<b>				1ST TECHNICIAN
</b>		How the fuck does he do that?

<b>				2ND TECHNICIAN
</b>		It's wires, man.

<b>				1ST TECHNICIAN
</b>		I never seen no wires.

<b>				2ND TECHNICIAN
</b>			(sarcastic)
		So what is it?  Magic?

<b>	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - AUDITORIUM AND STAGE - NIGHT
</b>
	The LIGHTS are DIMMING.  Harry glances across at Dorothea,
	whose gaze is intent. 

	The LIGHTS go OUT.  The MUSIC SWELLS, and the CURTAINS fly
	apart.  A spectacle worthy of Seigfried and Roy is about to
	blast our senses!  Magic for the 90's:  a wild, erotic ride
	into mystery.

<b>				SWANN (V.O.)
</b>		Ladies and gentlemen.  You are
		standing on the threshold of a
		miracle...

	A vortex of SMOKE and LIGHT swirls in the middle of the
	stage. 

	The vortex BLAZES -- 

	And suddenly Swann SWEEPS DOWN out of the flies, as the floor
	of the stage opens and the head of a glittering, razor
	toothed DRAGON emerges in a cloud of CRIMSON SMOKE. 

	Swann raises his hands above his head and a SPEAR
	miraculously appears in his grasp.  He descends on the
	dragon.  It's a classic image:  St. Michael smiting the
	Devil.  Swann drives the spear down the throat of the dragon. 
	The theatre SHAKES at its dying ROARS.  Then the head cracks
	open, and out of the dragon's mouth emerge a dozen scantily
	dressed DANCERS, male and female.  Swann throws down the
	spear, and where it strikes the stage his PANTHER appears. 

	A ROAR of APPLAUSE from the audience.  Swann's plain white
	tunic falls away from him as he descends.  By the time his
	feet touch the stage he is dressed in a star- shot TUXEDO. 
	The PANTHER licks his hand in welcome. The MUSIC comes to a
	crescendo.  The DANCERS freeze in their erotic dance.  In the
	sudden hush, Swann speaks in a whisper.

<b>				SWANN
</b>		My friends ... come with me...into
		the Great Beyond.

	A barrage of LIGHTS and MUSIC erupt. 

	The AUDIENCE APPLAUDS wildly. 

	ON HARRY and Dorothea.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		He's good.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		You haven't seen anything yet.

<b>	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - LOBBY - NIGHT

	The doors SQUEAK as a gust of WIND blows through them. 

	Butterfield stands in the lobby, listening to the muted
	SOUNDS of MUSIC and APPLAUSE.  Then he offers his ticket to
	the TICKET-COLLECTOR and steps inside.

<b>	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - AUDITORIUM AND STAGE - NIGHT

	A new musical motif hangs in the air:  MUSIC announcing
	danger. 

	The AUDIENCE watches intently, nervously. 

	ON HARRY and DOROTHEA.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>			(a whisper)
		This is the new illusion.

	ON STAGE, Swann is bound to a spinning WHEEL, while the
	DANCERS, dressed like Boschian DEMONS, cavort around him,
	somersaulting and leaping over eruptions of yellow FLAME. 
	It's a scene from Daniels Inferno.  Above him. a dozen
	glittering SWORDS - six feet long - are descending.  He
	struggles to free himself.  The MUSIC gets more exciting as
	the wheel spins faster and faster. 

	Suddenly, a sword DROPS.  It falls between Swann's
	outstretched legs, skewering the wheel.  Then ANOTHER, close
	to his head. 

	ON HARRY.  He's tense.  Excited. 

	BACK TO STAGE.  Swann is free I  He throws off the last
	shackle and uses it to thrust into the mechanism of the
	wheel.  There's a theatrical BLAZE of white-hot SPARKS.

	The wheel slows.  He starts to step off it, as another of the
	the swords DROPS. 

	The AUDIENCE GASPS.  Swann smiles, and TRIPS. 

	As he FALLS, the sword runs through the middle of his back,
	carrying him down to the still-spinning wheel, and pinning
	him there.  Some of the DANCERS continue to cavort.  Some
	stop. 

	More GASPS from the audience. 

	ON HARRY, having a -- 

	FLASHBACK:  Harry's hand turns over the final tar of card. 
	The scene on the stage is that image coming to life. 

<b>				HARRY 
</b>		There's something wrong... 

	ON Swann, as a second sword FALLS, skewering his thigh, and a
	third, running through his buttock, and a fourth and fifth,
	until TEN SWORDS have entered his body. 

	ON THE AUDIENCE, not certain whether this is a trick or not.

	The MUSIC has stopped.  In the silence, somebody GIGGLES
	nervously.  A couple of PEOPLE break into APPLAUSE, but it
	dies away in a matter of moments.

<b>	ON DOROTHEA AND HARRY
</b>
<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		No. . .

	ON THE STAGE, Swann raises his head and looks out at his
	wife, his eyes already glassy with imminent death.  He
	reaches out towards her, and then sags on the wheel, dead. 

	There are GASPS now from the audience.  Murmurs of disgust;
	sobs of horror.

<b>				1ST AUDIENCE MEMBER
</b>		What happened?

<b>				2ND AUDIENCE MEMBER
</b>		It's a trick.

<b>				3RD AUDIENCE MEMBER
</b>		Somebody help him.

	The curtains start to close.

	ON Dorothea, tears of shock filling her eyes.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>			(to Harry)
		I've got to get to him!

	The AUDIENCE is rising now, as the horror of what they've
	seen sinks in.  There is panic.  A few people have fainted. 
	One or two are even praying. 

	Harry carves out a path down to the stage for Dorothea
	against the flood of the exiting crowd.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Out of the way!  Out of the way!

	He helps Dorothea onto the stage, and lifts the curtain so
	she can duck beneath it.

<b>	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - NIGHT
</b>
	Chaos.  PEOPLE running, sobbing, puking; some simply standing
	watching.  Valentin is already at the body, with the STAGE
	MANAGER at his side.

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>			(to Stage Manager)
		Get then out of here, for God's
		sake --

<b>				STAGE MANAGER
</b>		You heard him!  It's not a fucking
		show!

	He starts to physically push the crowd back.  Harry grabs his
	arm.

<b>				STAGE MANAGER
</b>		Who are you?

	Harry uses his grip to gently but efficiently move the STAGE
	MANAGER out of Dorothea's way.  She goes to Swann's body,
	which has been removed from the wheel.

<b>	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
</b>
	The audience is clearing now.  But Butterfield is coming
	towards the stage, with an ambiguous look on his face. Is he
	enraged?  Or puzzled?  Or both?

<b>				MILLER
</b>		Psst!

	Miller stands at an open door, leading below the stage.

	Butterfield enters.

<b>	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - NIGHT
</b>
	Dorothea kneels at Swann's side.  A few yards from her, Harry
	examines the mechanism of the wheel.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>			(softly)
		Swann... 

	A DOCTOR appears.

<b>				DOCTOR 
</b>		I'm a doctor.  Let me through. 

	The Doctor checks Swann's body.

<b>				DOCTOR
</b>			(to Dorothea)
		I'm sorry...

	Harry has discovered a CABLE snaking down beside the device. 
	He's suspicious.  He slips round to the back of the
	mechanism, and climbs down beneath the stage, tracing the
	cable as he goes.

<b>	WILTERN THEATRE - BELOW STAGE - NIGHT
</b>
	It's an eerie, shadowy space, filled with the PROPS that are
	used in the show, including the DRAGON we saw at the
	beginning.  From above we hear FOOTSTEPS and VOICES, muted
	and echoing. 

	The cable ends in bare wires.  Whatever was here has been
	taken. 

	A NOISE, behind Harry.  He swings round.  Sees a shadowy
	FIGURE ducking away.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Hey!

	He gives chase.  Loses the man in the shadows.  Stops and
	listens for movement. 

	Suddenly, Miller steps out of the shadows with a plank of
	wood and smashes it into Harry's face!

	Harry reels back.  Falls to his knees, BLOOD running from his
	nose.  Miller pulls Harry's GUN out of his jacket.

<b>				MILLER
</b>		Got you, fucker!

	Harry is facing the dragon's head, dazed.  And now, out of
	the dragon's mouth, comes Butterfield. 

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		Who did this, D'Amour?  Who killed
		Swann? 

	Harry is barely holding on to consciousness.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		You did.
			(a beat)
		Didn't you?

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		Why would I do that?

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Beats me.

	Butterfield is a foot from Harry now.

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		You don't have a clue what you're
		into, do you?

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Deep shit? 

	Butterfield hits him.

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		Who did this?

<b>				HARRY
</b>		I told you --

	Butterfield hits him again.

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		Who did this?

<b>				HARRY
</b>			(raises his hand)
		All right.  It was...

	Butterfield comes a little closer.

<b>				HARRY
</b>			(feigning a near collapse)
		... it was...

	Butterfield leans in.  And Harry grabs him by the balls --
	literally -- rising as he does so.

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		Aah!

	Harry THROWS Butterfield aside. Butterfield hits the ground
	in agony, and Harry swings round to protect himself from
	Miller, who's leveling Harry's gun. 

	He FIRES once, missing Harry by inches.  Harry catches hold
	of a ROPE underfoot and pulls it, tripping Miller, who
	TOPPLES backwards into the mouth of the dragon.  The GUN GOES
	OFF again, the bullet BLOWING APART the dragon's JAW
<b>	MECHANISM. 
</b>
	Miller starts to sit up, his body splayed between the
	dragon's steel teeth.  He has Harry in his sights. 

	-- something CREAKS.  He looks up.  The dragon's jaw is
	closing, FAST.  He starts to scramble to his feet.  Too late! 
	The teeth SLAM CLOSED on his body.  Sudden death. 

	Harry looks round to see Butterfield retreating into the
	shadows.  Then he's gone.  Harry looks down at Miller's
	BLOOD, which is pooling around his feet.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Deep shit...

		Another fucking magician. Jesus.

	Harry looks past Eddison and sees an ashen, tearful Dorothea

	Dorothea sits alone, staring at the wall.  Harry enters.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Are they treating you okay?

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>			(nods)
		I heard what happened.  It looks
		like somebody murdered him.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		I'm sorry I got into this too late. 
		But if you want me to stick around,
		maybe dig where the cops don't
		look...

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		I don't know where you'd start.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Well... how about some of the other
		illusionists?

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		They won't tell you anything.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		I can be very persuasive.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>			(a beat)
		Yes.  I think you probably can.
			(another beat)
		We'd need to talk about your fee.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Forget the fee.  If I find
		Butterfield, maybe we'll talk about
		money.  If I don't...
			(he shrugs)
		...my gamble.  Either way... I
		get to spend some time... here.

	The way he says this, it's plain "here" doesn't mean L.A., it
	means near -Dorothea.  And by the tiny smile on her face,
	it's also plain she knows it.

	A wonderland for illusionists.  Books, props, masks, tricks,
	etc.  Two or three CUSTOMERS browse.  Harry glances at them
	all, then targets a MAN in late middle age, who is browsing
	through books, one-handed.  His other hand constantly
	manipulates a card, concealing and revealing it in a dozen
	ways.  He doesn't even look at his hand.  His name is WALTER
<b>	WILDER. 
</b>
	Harry stands beside him.  Scans the shelf.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Where'd you learn that?

<b>				WILDER
</b>		What?

<b>				HARRY
</b>			(points)
		That.

<b>				WILDER
</b>		At birth.  I don't know you --

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Harry D'Amour.

<b>				WILDER
</b>		I know all the kids coming up. Got
		to stay ahead of the game. But I
		don't know you.

</b>		I'm in from New York.  I came to
		see Swann.

<b>				WILDER
</b>		What a tragedy.  It was just a
		matter of time, of course, but it's
		not good for the business.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Was he taking a lot of risks?

<b>				WILDER
</b>		You don't know the half of it. I'm
		Walter Wilder, by the way.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Not the Walter Wilder? 

	Walter beams.

<b>				WILDER
</b>		The one and only. 

	He hands Harry a card.

<b>				WILDER
</b>		Want to try?

	Harry tries to emulate Wilder's card manipulation through the
	rest of this conversation.

<b>				WILDER
</b>		You know Vinovich?

<b>				HARRY
</b>			(not a clue)
		Sure.  Vivovich.

<b>				WILDER
</b>		He knew Swann way back.  He says
		there were a lot of drugs, a lot of
		crazy shit.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		I'd love to... you know... hang
		with some of you guys.

<b>				WILDER
</b>		People are pretty cagey.  Who do
		you know?

<b>				HARRY
</b>		For what?

<b>				WILDER
</b>		For an introduction.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Well... nobody.

	Wilder takes a moment to assess Harry, who is attempting to
	manipulate the card he's been given with charming ineptitude.

<b>				WILDER
</b>			(magnanimously)
		You do now.

<b>	EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - DUSK

	The castle is faux, of course, but it has a Gothic charm. 

	Harry and Walter wander towards the front door.  Harry is

<b>				HARRY
</b>		I only wear ties for funerals.

<b>				WILDER
</b>		You don't get in without one. It's

	Walter leads the way through the long corridors, past rooms
	where illusionists are performing close-up magic for
	audiences of well-heeled patrons.  Walter nods and waves to
	half a dozen people on their way through the house, up the
	stairs and towards the bar.

<b>HARRY
</b>		Are they all in the business?

<b>				WILDER
</b>		It's not a business. Harry. It's a
		vocation. 

	Wilder points to a locked door.

<b>				WILDER
</b>		That's what they call the
		Repository.  Every magic secret
		known to man's locked up in that
		room.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Have you been in?

<b>				WILDER
</b>		No.  There's only three keys.
		Vinovich has got one, of
		course.
			(beat)
		He's a little crazy, by the way. 
		And he's a mean drunk. Otherwise,
		he's a real charmer.

<b>				CUT TO
</b>
<b>	INT. MAGIC CASTLE - BAR - NIGHT
</b>
	Later.  A drunken VINOVICH is holding court.  He's in his
	40's:  a flamboyant and loquacious man with a heavy (and
	fake) middle-European accent.  At the table - besides Harry
	and Walter - are:  Vinovich's starlet/nymphet girlfriend
	LAURA; an Asian-American illusionist called BILLY WHO; and
	two of Vinovich's adoring courtiers, an overblown,
	overdressed female illusionist - DEBRA DEVINE - and a thin,
	waspish fellow in a spangly suit:  the AMAZING QUENTIN. 

	In the conversation that follows we go back to Harry
	repeatedly as he studies this extraordinary group.

<b>				VINOVICH
</b>		It's more than entertainment. We're
		opening people's heads up.  Putting
		miracles back into their boring
		little lives.

<b>				BILLY
</b>		But they're fake miracles.

<b>				VINOVICH
</b>		Houdini believed he had spirit
		guides.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		You believe that?

<b>				VINOVICH
</b>		I think we walk a narrow path,
		between... between...

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Heaven and Hell?

	Vinovich stares hard at Harry, trying to figure out whether
	he's being sarcastic or not.

<b>				VINOVICH
</b>		Trickery and divinity.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Are you saying that sometimes
		the miracles are real?

<b>				VINOVICH
</b>		No.  I'm saying they were always
		fake.  The saints, the messiahs,
		they were just illusionists.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		So could you walk on water?

<b>				VINOVICH
</b>			(deadly serious)
		I could reproduce any miracle
		that's ever been performed, with a
		little preparation.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		What about Swann's miracles?

	The smug smile on Vinovich's face dies.  Furtive glances are
	exchanged around the table.  Only Billy Who makes a tiny
	smile.

<b>				VINOVICH
</b>		They weren't worth a damn.

<b>				HARRY
</b>			(goading)
		I heard he was the best.

<b>				VINOVICH
</b>		If he was so good why's he so dead?

	Vinovich begins to look suspicious.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd
		maybe have a theory.

<b>				VINOVICH
</b>		Oh, I've got plenty.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		I'd like to hear them. 

	Vinovich rises.

<b>				VINOVICH
</b>		I'm not saying another word.
			(to Wilder)
		You damn fool.  He's a
		journalist.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Just tell me about Swann.  Or are
		you too scared?

<b>				VINOVICH
</b>		He was a freak.  Everything he did
		was tainted.

	Harry rises.  Looks straight at Vinovich, unintimidated.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		With what?

<b>				VINOVICH
</b>		Evil.  He was evil.
			(to Laura)
		Come on.

	She rises.

<b>				VINOVICH
</b>			(to the rest)
		Say nothing to this man if you wish
		to keep my company.

	He stalks away.  Harry calls after him, across a now-
	silenced bar.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Great accent, by the way.  Is it
		Brooklyn?

<b>				VINOVICH
</b>			(pure Brooklyn)
		Fuck you.

<b>	EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</b>
	Harry heads to the car.

<b>				BILLY (V.O.)
</b>		Harry!

	Harry turns.  Billy approaches, glancing behind him to see
	that he's not being watched.

<b>				BILLY
</b>		I gotta be careful.  If Vinovich
		sees me talking to you.  He's an
		asshole, but he's a powerful
		asshole.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		They go together.

<b>				BILLY
</b>			(lowered voice)
		I've heard a name.  Someone they
		talk about in whispers.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Who?

<b>				BILLY
</b>		Nix.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Nix?

<b>				BILLY
</b>		Like in nothing.  Nobody.  Nix.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Who is he?

<b>				BILLY
</b>		I think maybe he taught Swann.
			(hands Harry a card)
		This is me.  See ya around. 

	Billy hurries away.

	Harry lies on his bed, dozing.  The CAMERA CREEPS IN on him.

	Harry frowns in his semi-doze.

<b>				DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>	FLASHBACK - QUAID'S ROOM
</b>
<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		Ever watched a man die?

	The image darkens, and fades up a beat later on Quaid.

<b>				QUAID
</b>		Please... I wasn't there... Ask
		Pimm.

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's

	A long silence. 

	SUDDENLY, a telephone RINGS.

<b>				BACK TO:
</b>
<b>	INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	HARRY sits up, shocked awake.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Shit!

	He picks up the receiver.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		This is D'Amour.

</b><b>           
</b><b>			CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	She sits up on her bed, dressed in a silk robe, and nothing
	else, drinking a SCOTCH, talking on the phone. The primary
	source of illumination is the massive T.V. set in the wall
	opposite the bed.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		Harry... I know it's late.

<b>	INTERCUT PHONE CONVERSATION
</b>
	There should be a subtle eroticism pervading this exchange. 
	Both of them on beds, in different bedrooms. Each aroused by
	the other's voice, and frustrated not to be able to see and
	touch them.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		That's okay.

	As he speaks, Harry scrawls Jennifer Desiderio on the title
	page of the Gideon's Bible beside the bed.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		How did it go today?

<b>				HARRY
</b>		I went up to the Magic Castle. You
		were right.  He didn't have a lot
		of fans up there.

	Valentin, on the kitchen PHONE, is listening in.

<b>				DOROTHEA (V.O.)
</b>		They were jealous of him.

</b>		Why?  Because he had you?

<b>				BACK TO:
</b>
<b>	INTERCUTTING: HARRY - DOROTHEA - VALENTIN
</b>
<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		He... didn't have me..  I told you-

<b>				HARRY
</b>		You didn't marry him for love.

</b>
	She's a little uncomfortable now.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		So why did you marry him?

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		That's my business. Harry.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Just curious.
			(a beat)
		Back to business.  Ever heard of a
		man called Nix?
			(silence)
		Dorothea?

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't
		know the name.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		What about Jennifer Desiderio?

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to
		go.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Okay.  I'll keep digging.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>			(uneasy)
		Yes.  You do that.

	She puts down the phone, and swallows a mouthful of scotch. 
	She's shaking.  She gets up.  Paces the room. Then she picks
	up the phone again.

<b>	INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	On the pad beside the bed, Jennifer's name, surrounded by
	Harry's doodles.  The phone RINGS. 

	CUT WIDE:  The room is empty.

<b>	EXT./INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - STAIRWELL - NIGHT
</b>
	The Tarot Card and Crystal Readings sign is dark now. Harry
	heads up the stairs, past the PHOTOGRAPHS, to the door of
	Quaid's Waiting Room. 
	It has been locked and taped by the police.  Harry has come
	prepared.  He takes out a small crowbar and levers off the
	locks.

<b>	INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - WAITING/FORTUNE TELLING ROOMS - NIGHT  
</b>
	Harry enters, FLASHLIGHT on.  He crosses the Waiting Room and
	enters the Fortune-Telling Room where Quaid died.  On the
	TRACK -- a remote, eerie presence -- we hear Quaid's SOBS,
	Miller's SHOUTS, and, as Harry's flashlight illuminates the
	blood-spattered table:

<b>				BUTTERFIELD (V.O.)
</b>		If you watch very closely, you can
		sometimes see the soul escaping.

	Harry is spooked.  He starts to search the room, opening
	cabinets and drawers.  Quaid's hordes of mystical bric-a-brac
	are stashed everywhere.  Boxes of crystals, religious
	statues, elaborate cards, incense, etc.

	He pulls open a drawer, and notices that a rosary is wedged
	in a niche at the base of the drawer.  He pulls the drawer
	out, empties its contents on the table, and examines it. 

	Using the crowbar, he forces the drawer apart.  It has a
	false bottom.

<b>				HARRY
</b>			(smiles)
		Yes...

	In the secret compartment, some papers and an address book. 
	He flicks to "D."

<b>				HARRY (CONT'D)
</b>		Desiderio...

	There it is.  Jennifer Desiderio, and an address.  He pockets
	the book.  Then, sensing a presence behind him, he pulls out
	his gun and whirls around, his flashlight beam revealing --

	-- Valentin!

<b>				HARRY (CONT'D)
</b>		What the fuck are you doing here?

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		Looking for you.  I tried the
		hotel.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Why'd you come here?

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		You're a detective, with no clues. 
		Where else are you going to look? 
		I'm going to keep this brief.
			(he takes out an envelope)
		Here's thirty thousand dollars.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		What for?

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		A ticket home,

<b>				HARRY
</b>		You didn't hire me.  She did.
		If she wants me off the job, I
		want to hear it from her.

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		She doesn't want to see you. She's
		had enough pain.  Enough churning
		over the past.  She wants it all
		left alone.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Left alone?  Somebody's been
		murdered.

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		Yes.  It's regrettable

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Fuck regrettable!  I want to know
		why.

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		What for?  You need to stay busy?

<b>				HARRY
</b>			(a confession)
		I like to know why things happen.

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		Why people die?
			(shakes his head)
		Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		No.

	Harry crosses to the door, brushing past Valentin.

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		Don't try and see her, D'Amour.
		Just leave her alone.  Let her
		heal.

	He glances back at Valentin.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Lock up, will you?

<b>				CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	EXT. ST. LUKE'S SANITORIUM, PASADENA - DAY
</b>
	ON THE ADDRESS BOOK, in Harry's hands.

	Harry looks up - with some surprise - not at a house but at a
	building, the sign on which reads, "St. Luke's Sanitorium".

<b>	INT. ST. LUKE'S SANITORIUM - DAY
</b>
	The place is bland and functional throughout, the walls
	decorated with sun-faded reproductions of great paintings. 
	Nothing disturbing.  Harry is talking to D.A. TOFFLER -
	black, fortyish, softly spoken - and a Nurse.

<b>				TOFFLER
</b>		Jennifer's only ever had one
		visitor.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		A Mister Quaid?

<b>				TOFFLER
</b>		Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I
		saw it on the news. Jennifer
		doesn't know.  And frankly, this
		isn't the best tine for her to be
		told.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		I won't say anything.

<b>	INT. ST. LUKE'S SANITORIUM - CORRIDORS AND WARD - DAY
</b>
	Toffler excorts Harry through -the place.  There are
	distressing scenes on every side.  Nothing melodramatic no
	screaming, no fits.  Just a subtle, pervasive air of despair. 
	Blank, empty FACES in blank, empty rooms.

<b>				TOFFLER
</b>		Jennifer's been with us four years. 
		She was coming on nicely. 
		But just the last month or so,
		she's worse than ever.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		What's her problem?

<b>				TOFFLER
</b>		She has no real grip on reality.

<b>				HARRY
</b>			(a joke)
		Does anybody?

<b>				TOFFLER
</b>			(deadly serious)
		Oh yes.  We have to agree what's
		real and what's not. That's what
		holds us together.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		And what does Jennifer think's
		real?

	They've come to french windows, which are wide open. Sitting
	outside in the sun is Jennifer, with her back to us.

<b>				TOFFLER
</b>			(quietly)
		Jennifer thinks the Devil's coming
		for her.
			(louder)
		Jennifer?

	Jennifer turns.  She looks terrible.

<b>	EXT. ST. LUKE'S SANITORIUM - GROUNDS - CITY STREET - DAY
</b>
	Harry and Jennifer walk amongst the flower-beds, with the
	Nurse keeping a watch from a discreet distance. Throughout
	the scene we HEAR the SOUND of earth being dug, which
	steadily gets louder as they walk.

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>		Have we met before?

<b>				HARRY
</b>		No.

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>		Only I forget.  They give me pills,
		you know, to keep me... even...
		and... I forget things,

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Well, you didn't forget me.  I just
		came because I wanted to know if
		you knew a man called Butterfield.

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>		Maybe... I... don't...

<b>				HARRY
</b>		What about Philip Swann?

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>		I knew Swann.
			(sudden vehemence)
		He's a fucking liar.

	A WORKMAN saunters past, carrying pipes.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Why's that?

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>		He said he knew how to protect us. 
		But he didn't know anything.  He
		made us think it was over and done
		with.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		What is?

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>			(tears nearing)
		I don't want to think about it. If
		I think about it he'll hear me. 
		He'll find me.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Swann?

	Ahead now, the site where the workmen are digging a hole,
	laying pipes.  The CAMERA doesn't focus on this action, but
	we're aware of it.

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>		I told you.  I don't --

	She stops.  Looks ahead of her.  Her face is suddenly ashen
	and clammy.  Harry follows her gaze to: 

	The hole.  Somebody is in it, digging.  Earth emerges in
	shovelfuls, piling up beside the hole.

<b>				JENNIFER (CONT'D)
</b>			(screaming)
		God no!  Oh God no!

	She backs away from the hole.  The Nurse grabs hold of her.

<b>				NURSE
</b>		Calm down!

	She delivers the Nurse a backhand SWIPE.  The Nurse is flung
	back.

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>		He's not going to get me!

	She races down towards the street.  Harry goes after her.

<b>				JENNIFER (CONT'D)
</b>		He's not!  He's not!

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Who's not? 

	He catches up with her.

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>		Nix! Nix!

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Is he the Puritan?

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>		Yes! Yes!

<b>				HARRY
</b>		And he's dead?

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>		No.  He's coming back.  He's
		digging his way out!

	The Nurse appears behind Harry.

<b>				NURSE
</b>		I'll take care of her now.

	Jennifer struggles in Harry's grip.

<b>				NURSE
</b>		Let go of her, Mr. D'Amour!

	The Nurse breaks Harry's hold on Jennifer, who slips away
	instantly, racing towards the street.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Jennifer!

	She scrambles up over a wall, and flings herself from the
	top.  There's a SCREECH of brakes, then the smashing of
	metalwork and glass.  Harry gets to the wall before the
	Nurse.  Hoists himself up onto it.  Looks down.

<b>	HARRY'S P.O.V. OF STREET
</b>
	Jennifer is dead in the middle of the street, beneath the
	wheels of a car.  The DRIVER is out, and yelling
	incoherently. 

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Jesus.

	He slips back down the wall, and leans against it.

	He looks towards the hole.  The Workman has stopped digging. 
	His mud-encrusted hands emerge, and for a moment, before his
	head appears, the image is eerily like somebody climbing from
	a grave.  Harry closes his eyes.

<b>				HARRY
</b>			(very quietly)
		Jesus.

</b>		I'm afraid she's not in.

</b>		When will she be in?

	Valentin on the phone in the study.

	Valentin puts the phone down.

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		Crank call.  I'll get the number
		changed.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		No word from D'Amour?			    

	Valentin shakes his head.

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		It's better he's gone.  He would
		have done more harm than good.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think,
		so.  Try him again at the hotel.

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		I left three messages already.

	Dorothea nods, plainly sad at Harry's desertion.  She turns
	and leaves the room.

<b>	INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	ON BILLY WHO'S CARD, in Harry's hand.

</b>
	Harry's manipulating the lock.

<b>				BILLY
</b>		I'm sure they'll have this place
		rigged.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		How?

<b>				BILLY
</b>		It'll be something hokey. 

	CLICK! The door opens.

<b>				BILLY
</b>		Houdini'd been proud of you.

<b>	INT. MAGIC CASTLE - REPOSITORY - NIGHT
</b>
	Undusted shelves piled high with manuscripts, old books, and
	posters in every direction.

<b>				BILLY
</b>			(impressed)
		Whoa...

	On the wall, plaster LIFE-MASKS.  In glass cases, the tools
	of the great magicians:  KNIVES, KEYS, GUNS, WANDS, even an
	IRON MAIDEN.  Billy is in awe.  He wanders around wide-eyed
	while Harry scans the shelves. The dialogue runs as they
	investigate.

<b>				BILLY
</b>		I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		You heard right.

<b>				BILLY
</b>		You ever been married?

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Yeah.  She was killed in a car
		crash.  Her lawyer was driving. She
		was filing for divorce.

<b>				BILLY
</b>		Why?

<b>				HARRY
</b>		My life was too weird for her.

<b>				BILLY
</b>			(grinning)
		I love weird.

	Harry has seen a small SIGIL carved onto one of the shelves.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Billy?  This was on Miller's
		forehead.  Any idea what it is?

<b>				BILLY
</b>		Nope.

	Harry presses it.  The entire bookcase opens up, CREAKING.

<b>				BILLY
</b>		What did I tell you?  So fucking
		hokey.

	Inside, there is a small shelf.  On it, FILES and PAPERS.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		What have we got here?

	Ever-eager, Billy steps into the recess.  And -- 

	two spiked, latticed gates close on his arm! 

	Harry grabs the gates before they snap closed, inches from
	skewering Billy's flesh and bone!  He keeps them open, his
	sinews straining.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Grab the files!

	Billy reaches in and pulls out a handful of the files. As he
	steps out of range. Harry lets go and the gates close with a
<b>	CLANG!
</b>
<b>				BILLY
</b>		Jesus!

	He slams the files down.  He's trembling.

<b>				BILLY
</b>		I could have lost my fucking hands.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		That would have kept you out of the
		Magic Circle.
			(he studies the files)
		Which was presumably the idea.
			(a beat)
		These are about Nix.

	Harry takes a sheaf of papers, and hands them to Billy.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		You go through these.  Go on!

	Reluctantly, Billy does so.  Harry picks up a faded
	PHOTOGRAPH of the doorway to Nix's HOUSE (with the sigil
	painted on it) and BUTTERFIELD the child standing in the sun. 
	There are other CULTISTS standing around.  And in the DOORWAY
	-- a barely visible figure (and all the more intimidating for
	that) - is NIX.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Wait a minute...

	He stares at the boy's face.  The eyes are clearly different
	colours.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		That's Butterfield...

<b>				BILLY
</b>			(points to nan in)
		doorway)
		And who's that?

	ON HARRY, staring at the ambiguous presence. 

	ON THE PHOTOGRAPH of the shadowy figure.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		At a guess?  The Puritan.  Nix.

	Billy picks up an ETCHING, water-stained and dirty.  It shows
	a horror we recognize:  a man's HAND pressed into the FLESH
	of another man's HEAD.

<b>				BILLY
</b>		Take a look at this.

<b>				HARRY
</b>			(looking at it)
		A Nix specialty?

	Billy is getting subtly spooked now.  He puts the etching
	down and starts to go through others in the series.  We
	glimpse them as he does so.  In one, a MAN regurgitates a
	serpentine form made of FLAME.  In another, a MAN stares at
	his own HAND which is STRIPPED OF FLESH.  There is no bone
	beneath.  Only a form of solid blackness.  In a third, we see
	a HEAD with a slit in the middle of the brow, emanating
<b>	DARKNESS.
</b>
<b>				BILLY
</b>		I don't know any of these tricks...

	Harry studies the etchings.

<b>				HARRY
</b>			(a slow burn)
		Maybe they're not tricks.

<b>				BILLY
</b>			(mystified)
		I mean, there's no instructions--
			(realizes what Harry said)
		What do you mean, they're not
		tricks?

<b>				HARRY
</b>		What did Vinovich say? Something
		about walking a path between --

<b>				BILLY
</b>		Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he
		says that all the time.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		That's because he knew.  He'd seen
		these files and knew.

<b>				BILLY
</b>		Knew what?

	Out of the corner of his eye. Harry sees a motion between the
	book-stacks.  Billy frowns.  Harry puts his fingers to his
	lips.  Gestures for Billy to take cover. Billy backs away. 
	Harry slowly turns in the direction of the motion. 

	Something eerily sepulchral is gliding between the stacks.  A
	figure in a straight-jacket with his head bowed.

	Harry takes out his gun. 

	Billy disappears around the back of one of the stacks. Harry
	goes after the apparition. 

	The TRACK is completely silent. 

	Suddenly, the creature appears behind Billy!  It looks up,
	its face that of a psychotic:  burning eyes, manic smile. 

	It tears open its straight-jacket and reaches for Billy, who
	backs away.

<b>				BILLY
</b>		Harry!

	Books tumble on top of Billy as he stumbles against the
	shelves.

<b>				BILLY
</b>		Where the fuck are you?

	Harry appears, and puts his gun to the PSYCHO'S head.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Okay.  Hold it right there.

	The gun goes through the Psycho's skull, as though it's made
	of smoke. 

	Harry waves his hands through it.  It's completely ethereal. 

	But it's still terrorizing Billy.

<b>				BILLY
</b>			(in mortal terror)
		Get it off me!

	Harry glances around.  Sees a LIGHT flickering between some
	books.  FIRES at it.  The light goes out.  The "Psycho"
	vanishes.  Billy is left hyper-ventilating on the ground.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Hokey enough for you?

<b>				BILLY
</b>		I'm out of here, man!  Are you
		coming?

	Harry picks up a handful of papers from the Nix file.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		I'm coming.

	Billy is already out of the room.  For a moment. Harry pauses
	to look back at the other files, sealed behind the spiked
	gates. 

	As he does so --

	-- the proiector sparks into life one last time, and the
	"Psycho" appears --ROARING - at Harry's shoulder.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Ah, shaddup!

	He FIRES at the projector a second time.

	On the GUN SHOT --

<b>				CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - NIGHT
</b>
	Billy and Harry are parting.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Thanks, Billy.

<b>				BILLY
</b>		Hey, anytime.
			(a beat)
		Actually, no.  This was enough. 

	They shake, and part.

<b>	EXT. SWANN'S MANSION - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
</b>
	Harry waits on the doorstep.  Valentin opens the door.

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>			(quietly)
		I can't let you in.

<b>				HARRY
</b>			(stepping in)
		Yeah, I know.

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		You want more money, is that it?

	Harry pushes him aside.

<b>	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - VARIOUS - NIGHT
</b>
	Harry starts to go through the house, opening doors.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Dorothea?

	He sees candle-light through a partially open door. Starts
	towards it.

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		Leave her alone --

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Shut up!

	He pushes open the door.

<b>	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - CASKET ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	The room is a museum of Swarm's career.  Posters, and
	memorabilia everywhere.  And in the middle of the room,
	Swann's sealed CASKET, surrounded by flowers and candles. 
	Dorothea is standing beside it, head bowed.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		This is the way he wanted it... no
		autopsy, no embalming. Nobody
		meddling with his body...

	Harry approaches, slowly.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		Flesh is a trap.  That's what he
		used to say.  Flesh is a trap and
		magic sets us free.
			(a beat)
		Why did you come back?

<b>				HARRY
</b>		I didn't leave.  I was just digging
		around.

	Dorothea looks up at him.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>			(uneasy)
		What did you find?

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Jennifer Desiderio, for one.
			(he watches her for a
		response)
		She threw herself in front of a car
		this afternoon.

	Dorothea can't disguise her distress.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		Oh Christ.

<b>				HARRY
</b>			(a beat)
		Why don't you tell me the truth?

<b>	INT. SWANN'S MANSION- STUDY-- NIGHT-
</b>
	Dorothea pours herself a drink, while Harry spreads the
	PHOTOS and the PAPERS from the repository on the table.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Nix ran some kind of cult, right? 
		Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		It was more than that, I think.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		He was the real thing, right?

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		Swann said he could do stuff, yes.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Stuff?

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		He could get into people's heads. 
		Make them see things. Terrible
		things.  And he could levitate. 
		Juggle fire.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		He taught all this to Swann?

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		Some or it.

<b>	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - HALLWAY OUTSIDE STUDY - NIGHT
</b>
	Valentin is listening at the door.

<b>	INT. SWANN'S MANSION- STUDY-- NIGHT-
</b>
<b>				HARRY
</b>		So Swann was performing magic. not
		illusions?
			(Dorothea nods)
		And what?  You thought he should be
		using it to cure cancer, not making
		millions.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		I told you --

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess
		that'd turn anybody's head.
		Including yours.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		No.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		You said you weren't with him for
		love.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		I wasn't.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		 What then?

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		I was grateful to him.  I owed him
		my life.  And he loved me. He
		couldn't always show it, but he
		felt it.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		He thought Nix was coming back,
		didn't he?

	Dorothea is pouring herself another drink.  The glass slips
	from her hand.  It SHATTERS.  Harry goes to help her.  They
	stoop together, very close.  The sexual attraction is almost
	palpable. Dorothea cuts herself on a shard of glass.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		Shit!

	They are very close to each other.

<b>				HARRY
</b>			(reassuring)
		It's okay.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		No it isn't.  You can't help me.

<b>				HARRY
</b>			(tenderly)
		I'm here, aren't I?

	He kisses her.  She kisses him back, hard.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Nothing's going to happen to you.  

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>			(seductive)
		Nothing?

<b>				HARRY
</b>			(smiles)
		Nothing you don't want. 

	They kiss again, passionately.

<b>	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - LOBBY - NIGHT
</b>
	Valentin breaks into the shadows, as Harry and Dorothea cross
	the darkened lobby and head upstairs.  Then Valentin crosses
	to the phone and dials.

<b>	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	A room of illusions.  Walls lined with mirrors, and warm,
	flattering lighting, bathing the naked forms of Dorothea and
	Harry as they make love, sitting on the floor.

	It is a deeply passionate, but slow, sensual coupling.

<b>	INT./EXT. SWANN'S MANSION - LOBBY - NIGHT
</b>
	Valentin opens the front door.  There's a wind blowing. The
	palms churn against the night sky...

<b>	INTERCUT
</b>
	Roiling, wind-filled pains with the glistening, urgent bodies
	of Harry and Dorothea.

<b>	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Harry cradles Dorothea in post-coital languor.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>			(whispers)
		I was so afraid.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		Are you sure?

<b>				HARRY
</b>		I'm sure.
			(kisses her)
		He's dead.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		I know.  I'm the one who shot
		him.

	ON HARRY. He's startled, to say the least.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage,
		to get Swann to come to him.

<b>				HARRY
</b>			(realizing)
		And they all came...

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		Yes.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Quaid and Jennifer--

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		And Pimm and Swann.  Only Nix was
		ready for them.

	There's a NOISE downstairs.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>			(nervous)
		What was that?

<b>				HARRY
</b>		It's okay. 

	Harry slips out of bed.

<b>	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - STAIRS - LOBBY - NIGHT
</b>
	Harry descends the stairs, buttoning up his trousers (which
	is all he wears).  He has his gun.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Valentin? 

	Dorothea appears behind him.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		Harry?  Wait!

	Harry's at the bottom of the stairs now.  Across the hall, in
	a passageway, an eerie SILHOUETTE.  We can make out no detail
	of clothing or face.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		What the hell-?

	Suddenly, the shadowy FIGURE comes at Harry.  A BLAST of
	ENERGY bursts against Harry's face.  As it breaks against his
	skin, we see (for three frames or so) a glimpse of Harry's
	skull.

<b>				HARRY
</b>			(in pain)
		Aah!

	Harry FIRES at the figure.  The shadows fold up around the
	Stranger like an origami puzzle.  He's gone.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		It's him!  It's Nix!

	Harry goes out into the passageway.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Valentin!  Get some lights on!

	As if in reply to the command, a burst of vivid white FIRE
	erupts behind Harry.  He swings round to see the Stranger
	"unfolding" out of the shadows again, defying physics and
	physiology to do so.  The FIRE is at his feet, like a serpent
	writhing on the ground.  It comes at Harry.  Harry FIRES at
	it, but it comes at him faster still, rising to burn Harry's
	leg.  He retreats, the FIRE racing after him. He makes for a
	door, and flings it open.  He's in -- 

<b>	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - CASKET ROOM - NIGHT     
</b>
	The FIRE follows him across the ground and STRIKES his hand. 
	Harry drops the GUN.  Looks up to see the Stranger in the
	doorway, arm raised to will the fire-serpent on.  But then,
	he hesitates.  Harry glances round, and sees that the
	Stranger - whose face is still a dark smear - is staring at
	the CASKET.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Somebody you know?

	Dorothea appears behind the Stranger.  Sees Harry, burned and
	sweating, cornered against the casket.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		Oh my God!

	The Stranger looks round.  Harry snatches up the GUN,
	supporting his burned hand with -his good hand.  Levels the
	gun at the Stranger.  The FIRE raises its head, like a cobra.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Which goes first?  My face or
		your heart?

	The Stranger draws a deep breath.  The Fire-Serpent withers
	and dies.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		Who in God's name are you?

	She reaches for the Stranger, who simply folds up again; gone
	into darkness.  The WIND blows through the house, masking his
	exit.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		Are you all right?

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him
		in here!

	Dorothea disappears.  Harry takes one of the candle-holders
	and jams it under the casket lid.  Wood splinters.  He starts
	to force off the lid. 

	Valentin and Dorothea enter.

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		What are you doing?  This is
		sacrilege.

	He starts towards Harry.  Dorothea goes after him and catches
	hold of his arm.  Her expression is a mingling of fascination
	and dread, as Harry gets his fingers under the casket lid and
	pulls. 

	Inside, Swann's corpse.

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		Are you satisfied now?

<b>				HARRY
</b>		No.

	Harry holds Valentin back with one hand, and puts his finger
	into the corpse's mouth.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		Harry?

<b>				HARRY
</b>		It's all right.  It's not
		hurting...

	He now has four fingers in Swann's mouth and seizes hold of
	his lower jaw.  It cracks -- 

	-- and comes away in a little rain of plaster and latex.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		...plaster doesn't bleed.

	He tosses the jaw to Valentin.

<b>				HARRY
</b>			(to Dorothea)
		It looks like you're not a widow
		after all.

<b>	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - STUDY - NIGHT
</b>
	Harry interrogates Valentin in a white fury, while Dorothea
	binds Harry's hand.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		You rigged the illusion to fail,
		right?

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		Yes.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		You paid off the doctor.  You set
		up the fake body.  Yes?

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		Yes.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		And then... because I was
		getting too close to something --
			(at Dorothea)
		--or someone, you called Swann

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		I tried to pay you off.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Was that Swann's idea?

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		No.  It was mine.  I didn't want
		any more bloodshed. That's why we
		went to all this trouble, so
		there'd be no one for Nix to come
		after.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Nix is dead and buried, for
		fuck's sake.

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		Haven't you seen enough to know
		that doesn't matter?

	ON HARRY.  He looks as though he's beginning to think maybe
	Nix's resurrection is plausible.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		I want to see Swann face to face.

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		Why don't you leave this alone? Let
		everybody think it's over?

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		What about me?

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		Nix was never interested in you. 
		It was always Swann. 

	A beat.

<b>				HARRY
</b>			(to Dorothea)
		Maybe Valentin's right.  We should
		let it alone. 

	A BELL starts to TOLL-

<b>				HARRY
</b>			(con't.)
		He went to all that trouble to be
		dead.  Maybe we should let him stay
		that way.

	The TOLLING carries over into

<b>	EXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - DAY
</b>
	WE CRANE DOWN from a high angle on a GRAVE, surrounded by
	MOURNERS.  The graveside service has just ended, and the
	Mourners are beginning to disperse.  Dorothea is there
	amongst them, of course.  So are several faces we recognize: 
	Vinovich, Wilder, Billy Who, Swann's Stage Manager, his
	Dancers, his Technicians.  There are also several members of
	the PRESS, and thirty or fourty other Mourners, some of whom,
	to judge by their dress and manner, are also illusionists. 

	Harry stands some distance from the crowd, watching (hidden)
	from the doorway of a mausoleum.  His eyes are on Dorothea as
	she goes amongst the Mourners, receiving unheard words of
	condolesence.

<b>	EXT. WILTERN THEATRE - DAY
</b>
	The standee of Swann is being demolished by two WORKERS. They
	are taking hammers to it, smashing it to pieces.

<b>	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - DAY
</b>
	The stage is starkly lit with working lights, the auditorium
	in darkness.  Swann's equipment - including the partially
	dismantled Dragon's head - is heaped on the stage. 

	Valentin wanders through the boxes to the place where Swann
	"died."  He stares down at the BLOOD on the stage.

<b>	EXT. WILTERN THEATRE - DAY
</b>
	THE 1st WORKER throws the cut-out head of Swann's standee
	down into the street.

<b>				1ST WORKER
</b>		Watch out!

	On the HEAD, as it strikes the sidewalk at somebody's feet. 
	We don't see who.

<b>	EXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - DAY
</b>
	Harry catches sight of somebody close to the gates of the
	cemetery.  Dark glasses, a beard, an anonymous black suit. 

	Harry smiles slightly, and slips off between the mausoleums.

<b>	EXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - PARKING LOT - DAY
</b>
	The BLACK-COATED MOURNER gets into his car. 

	On Harry, as he gets into his.

<b>	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - DAY
</b>
	Valentin hears something in the auditorium.  Looks up.

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		Who's there?

	He reaches into his jacket to draw a GUN. There's a NOISE. 
	He swings round.  Too late.

	Butterfield has a scalpel at his throat.  He kicks Valentin
	to the ground.

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>			(conversationally)
		I've sometimes thought, if I'd had
		another profession, I would have
		been a surgeon.

	On Valentin, staring up in terror. 

	Valentin's P.O.V.- of Butterfield, upside down, above him,
	the scalpel glittering.

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		To be able to heal with one little
		cut.

	On Valentin again, as Butterfield's blade touches his cheek,
	just beneath his eye.

<b>				VALEMTIN
</b>		No. . .

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		Let's say those eyes of yours were
		giving you trouble.

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		Please.

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		I could scoop them out.

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		Don't.

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		So tell me where Nix is buried.

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		I don't know.

	Butterfield pushes the blade into Valentin's skin. 

	CUT WIDE, as Valentin thrashes, his face obscured by
	Butterfield's body.

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		Wait!

	On Valentin again.  There is a small cut beneath his eye, but
	that's all.

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		I'll tell you.

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		You'll do more.than that.

<b>	EXT. L.A. STREET - SEMI-DERELICT BUILDING - DAY
</b>
	A bad neighborhood, to judge by the state of the streets. 
	Harry gets out of his car and crosses to a gate, topped with
	barbed wire.  He peers through the bars. 

	Harry's P.O.V. of the STRANGER from the funeral disappearing
	into the building.  He glances back towards the street.  We
	get a glimpse of a bearded face beneath the brim of his hat. 

	Harry slides out of sight.  Waits until the Stranger has gone
	inside.  Then he's up, over the gate, braving the barbed
	wire.

<b>	INT. -SEMI-DERELICT BUILDING - DAY		   
</b>
	It's been a hospital.  Now the echoing corridors and wards
	are deserted, littered with reminders of old suffering. 
	Rotting mattresses; spilled boxes of surgical supplies. 

	Harry explores this tiled labyrinth, looking for some sign of
	the Stranger. 

	He enters a shadowy room.  Birds fly UP into his face! 

	As he retreats, another SOUND, a little distance from him. 
	GUN in hand, he heads towards it, and steps into

<b>	INT. SEMI-DERELICT BUILDING - OPERATING THEATRE - DAY
</b>
	Narrow shafts of light through the circular viewing window
	fall on an operating table, and looming pieces of discarded
	equipment.  Eerie.  Disturbing. 

	Harry scans the shadows as he advances into the room.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		I knew you wouldn't be able tn stay
		away.

	Silence.  Harry notices the beard and glasses on the
	operating table.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		You had to see who wept for you the
		most.

	Silence.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		A lot of people are going to be
		really pissed off when they
		discover you're still alive.

<b>				SWANN (V.O.)
</b>		They'll never find out. 

	Harry looks up.

	Svanrt is hovering in the air above him.  The veins in his
	temples bulge and throb.  This trick requires a lot of
	concentration.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Look, Ma, no wires.

<b>				SWANN
</b>		You shouldn't have followed me,
		D'Amour.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		How the fuck do you do that?

<b>				SWANN
</b>		Now I'm going to have to kill you.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		I don't think so.  You need me
		alive.

<b>				SWANN
</b>		Why?  So you can fuck my wife?

	Swann swoops down towards Harry, who levels his gun.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Be careful.  Funerals make me
		trigger-happy.

	Swann stops, inches from the ground.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		You know, it's such a fucking
		waste.  You can do shit most of us
		can only dream about, and you go
		around pretending it's some trick.

<b>				SWANN
</b>		Illusionists get. Las Vegas
		contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get
		burned.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Or murdered, like Nix.

<b>				SWANN
</b>		He deserved it.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Maybe he doesn't see it that way. 
		Maybe he's digging his
		way out of the hole you put him
		right now.  That's what you're
		hiding away from, isn't it?

<b>				SWANN
</b>		I did it for Dorothea.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Oh yeah?

<b>				SWANN
</b>		Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's
		off her.

	Harry grabs Swann, literally pulling him down to earth. Now
	they're face to face.  Eye to eye.  Swann, for all his
	posturing, is afraid.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		So Nix won't come looking for her?

<b>				SWANN
</b>		It's me betrayed him.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		And she shot him I  I think that'd
		piss me off if I were Nix.

<b>				SWANN
</b>			(despairing)
		I don't know what else to do.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Help me.

	On Swann, his face a churning mass of rage and fear.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Listen.  If he's back from the
		dead, then he is some kind of god. 
		And he'll find you, wherever the
		fuck you are. 
		And if he's just another phony
		Messiah, then you can stage the
		greatest come-back in history.

	ON Swann.  This doesn't sound like such a terrible idea.

<b>	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
	A car comes to a halt outside the house, where six vehicles
	are already gathered.  The SNAKE-HANDLING Cultist gets out. 
	SNAKES seethe out of the open car door.

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - VARIOUS - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
	We MOVE THROUGH the shadowy interior, catching sight of
	several CULTISTS as we go.  They all have looks of barely
	suppressed ecstasy on their faces. 

	We are moving towards the Sanctum, and it's getting darker. 
	A MATCH is struck, and an OIL-FLAME sputters into life.  We
	see NORMAN'S gleaming face. On the wall is a PICTURE of Nix,
	floating over a scene of apocalyptic destruction. 

	Norman brushes away thirteen years' accrual of DIRT. Beneath,
	Nix's expression is as rabid and terrifying as ever.  Norman
	grins.

<b>				CUT TO:

<b>	EXT. LIQUOR STORE - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
	A small, garishly-lit liquor store.  Harry's car pulls into
	the lot.  Swann gets out, his disguise back on. Heads into
	the store.  Harry, agitated and impatient, follows him.

<b>	INT. LIQUOR STORE - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
	Swann is at the cashier's desk, with a bottle of cheap
	brandy.

<b>				SWANN
</b>		Is this the best brandy you've
		got?

<b>				CASHIER
</b>		If that's what's on the shelves.

	Swann produces a thousand dollar bill out of thin air.

<b>				SWANN
</b>		Can you change a thousand for me?

<b>				CASHIER
</b>			(amazed)
		You're shittin' me.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Can we go?

	Swann starts to COUGH.  A QUARTER falls from his mouth.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Oh Jeez.

<b>				SWANN
</b>		Will that do?  No?

	Swann coughs again.  Puts his hand to his mouth.  A DELUGE of
	QUARTERS runs between his fingers.

<b>				SWANN
</b>		That better? 

	The Cashier gapes.

<b>				CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	EXT. SWANN'S MANSION - POOLSIDE - GROUNDS - DUSK
</b>
	The house could not look more reassuringly calm.  A SWAN
	struts beside the pool.  A long, HUSHED MOMENT...

<b>				SHOCK CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	DOROTHEA'S DREAM
</b>
	A BABOON SHRIEKS, its mouth filling the frame. 

	CUT WIDE, to reveal the Baboon, racing around Nix's Sanctum,
	crazed. 

	Hanging on the sculpture that swings from the roof is a
	shadowy figure.  Is it Nix?  We can't quite see.  Black BLOOD
	runs from the figure and splashes on the ground.

	NOW WE SEE DOROTHEA, being pulled by the Cultists towards the
	falling gouts of dark fluid --

	-- she struggles, SOBBING --

	-- Dorothea has a GUN in her hand.  The Cultists shake it
	from her grip, and pull her directly under the BLOOD -- as it
	SPLASHES on her upturned face --

</b>
	Looks down the stairs.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		Who's there?

	Silence.  Then, Valentin speaks behind her.  She jumps.

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		I'm sorry.

	BLOOD runs from his cut face.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		Jesus.  Valentin.  What did you do
		to your face?

<b>				BUTTERFIELD (V.O.)
</b>		It was me.

	She turns.  He's on her in a heartbeat, pressing her back
	against the wail.

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		Guess who we're going to see?

<b>	INT. HARRY'S CAR - DUSK
</b>
	Harry drives.  Swann takes a throatful of brandy.  Then he
	stares at Harry.

<b>				SWANN
</b>		You think I'm an asshole.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Didn't know you read minds.

<b>				SWANN
</b>			(a warning)
		I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. 
		But you know that.
			(an apology)
		So I like playing games with
		people.  Gives them something to
		wonder about...

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Is that all?

<b>				SWANN
</b>		I distract them from their banality
		for a few minutes. It's like a
		public service.  It doesn't mean
		much in the end. They're all going
		to die.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		And you're not? 

	Silence for a moment.

<b>				SWANN
</b>		Oh, I was going to discover the
		secret of the universe.  That's why
		I liked Nix.  He promised me all
		these explanations.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		And he didn't have them?

<b>				SWANN
</b>		He had something.  He showed me how
		to bend the rules.  A little
		levitation.  A few fireworks.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Is that all?

<b>				SWANN
</b>		No.
			(a beat)
		At the end... when we had him
		cornered, he got into my head. He
		showed me what we really look like,
		when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. 
		Shit...

<b>				HARRY
</b>		And you believed him?

<b>				SWANN
</b>		I saw it with my own fucking eyes! 
		See, that's his best trick.  No
		illusions.  Just the truth.
			(he looks at Harry)
		Are you ready for that? 

	Harry grabs the brandy bottle from Swann.

</b>		Hey!

	Harry drinks.

</b>		Thought not.

	Now he's on the landing.  Swann's below.

<b>				SWANN
</b>		She's not here.

	Harry spots Valentin's BLOOD on the carpet.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Did she know where Nix was buried?

<b>				SWANN
</b>		No.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Who else did?  Did Valentin?

<b>				SWANN
</b>		Yes.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Jesus!

<b>	EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT	 
</b>
	Butterfield's SEDAN crosses the desert, under a sky full of
	stars.

<b>	INT. BUTTERFIELD'S SEDAN - NIGHT       
</b>
	Valentin drives.  Butterfield and Dorothea are in the back. 
	Dorothea is handcuffed. 

	He has a bag open at his feet.  One by one he takes out a
	series of extraordinary instruments.  Dorothea looks on,
	confounded.

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		Like the look of these?  I made
		them myself, to set him free.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		Why did you wait so long?

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		I didn't have the skill to
		resurrect him.  I had to teach
		myself.  And that took time.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		And you think he'll be in a fit
		state to resurrect, after thirteen
		years?

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		If he was just a man like me, then
		no.  But he's not.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		What is he?

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		Maybe he'll show you.

	ON DOROTHEA, terror in her eyes.

<b>	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
	Now there are a dozen vehicles parked around the house.
	Through the windows, the flickering of oil-lamp FLAMES.

	There is a low, ominous CHANT floating from the house.

	It has no words, but it is steadily BUILDING in intensity. 
	We DRIFT towards the front door.

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Now we move down the passageway to the Meditation Room.

	Inside, SEVENTEEN CULTISTS kneel in a circle.  They are all
	CUTTING OFF THEIR HAIR, and throwing it into the FIRE that
	blazes in the centre of the circle.  They hack
	indiscriminately, with KNIVES, SCISSORS and RAZORS, their
	eyes wild.  BLOOD runs down their faces and necks from nicked
	ears and scalps.

	And still the CHANT BUILDS, and BUILDS...

<b>				NORMAN
</b>		He will come!  He will come! He
		will come!

<b>	EXT. DESERT - NIX'S GRAVE - NIGHT
</b>
	Wide.  A few rocks, and emptiness. 

	The headlamps of Butterfield's sedan burn in the darkness,
	illuminating the dig.  Valentin is in the grave, digging. 

	ON Butterfield, as he stands at the edge of the hole,
	watching the work.  Dorothea stands a yard or two behind him.

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		Anything?

<b>				VALENTIN (V.0.)
</b>		Not yet.

	Butterfield squats at the edge of the hole and suddenly
	reaches out for Valentin, hauling him close.

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		If you've lied to me to me --

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		I swear... this is the place Swann
		told me about.  The rocks...

	On Dorothea, who uses Butterfield's distraction to take a few
	steps back towards the open car door. 

	Dorothea's P.O.V. of Butterfield, back to her, interrogating
	Valentin.

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		Five more minutes.  Hear me? And
		you'd better not --

	A SOUND behind him.  Butterfield wheels round.  On the ground
	beside the open car door, the instruments.

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		What the fuck are you playing at?

	He goes to pick them up.  Dorothea steps from behind the
	door, with the sharpest in her hand.  She slashes at him. 
	Opens a WOUND across his arm.

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		Aah!

	He comes at her suddenly, striking the instrument from her
	hand, and slamming her against the car.  He hits her.  Once.
	Twice.  Then --

<b>				VALENTIN (V.O.)
</b>		Butterfield!

	Butterfield goes to the edge of the grave, picks up the
	flashlight and trains the beam on Valentin.

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>			(blinded)
		In the corner...

	The beam goes to the corner of the grave. 

	A mummified HAND is sticking out of one of the walls.

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>			(to Valentin)
		Keep away from it.

	Butterfield jumps down into the grave, and goes to the hand. 
	The TRACK is silent, but for Butterfield's shallow breath. 
	He reaches out to touch Nix^s fingers...

	Closer... 

	Closer... 

	He touches the hand - and the wall of sand comes down with a
<b>	ROAR!
</b>
	He jumps back as Nix's corpse, his head still sealed by the
	mask rolls into view.

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>			(reverentially)
		It's him... it's him.

	On Dorothea, sliding down the car in despair.

<b>				CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT. HARRY'S CAR - NIGHT
</b>
	The car is static; the engine still running.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		They got here before us.

<b>				SWANN
</b>		Looks that way.

<b>	EXT. NIX'S GRAVE - NIGHT
</b>
	Harry gets out of the car and starts towards the open grave.

<b>	HARRY'S MOVING P.O.V. OF THE GRAVE
</b>
	Harry reaches the grave's-edge.  It's totally dark.  He peers
	in.  On his heel, as the ground CRUMBLES beneath his weight. 
	Harry slides into the grave.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Shit!

	He's in darkness now.  He gets to his feet, and starts to try
	and scramble out.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Swann?  Swann!

	Silence.

	Suddenly, a hand is laid on his shoulder!  Harry swings
	round.  It's Valentin.  He has been badly cut up. 

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		D'Amour --

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Shit...

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		Help me.

	He collapses into Harry's arms.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Swann!

<b>	INT. HARRY'S CAR - NIGHT
</b>
	Indecision is written all over Swann's face:  to help or not
	to help?

<b>				HARRY (V.O.)
</b>		Swann!

	He decides.  Gets out.

<b>	EXT. NIX'S GRAVE - MIGHT
</b>
	Swann goes to the graveside, terrified.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Give me a hand.  I got Valentin.

	Together, Harry and Swann lift Valentin out of the grave and
	lay him in the blaze of the headlamps.

<b>				VALENTIM
</b>		He's got Dorothea. 

<b>				SWANN
</b>		And Nix?

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		Him too.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		We've got to get you to a hospital.

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		Don't bother.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Shut up.  We've lost enough lives
		already.

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		I'm sorry, D'Amour...

<b>				HARRY
</b>		What about?

<b>				VALENTIN
</b>		... Looks like you're going...
		to lose... one more.

	Valentin dies.

<b>				HARRY
</b>			(despairing)
		... no...

<b>				SWANN
</b>		He's better off this way.

<b>				HARRY
</b>			(furious)
		Nobody's better off this wav!

<b>				SWANN
</b>		You don't get it, do you? We're
		shit. D'Amour.

	He puts his foot beneath Valentin's body.  It rolls back into
	Nix's grave.

<b>				SWANN
</b>		That's where we're all going.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		In my time, and nobody else's.

	ON THE EMPTY GRAVE, as we HEAR the SOUND of Harry and Swann
	getting into the car.  The doors SLAM.  The CAR LIGHTS
	retreat.  The grave is left to DARKNESS.

<b>	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
	The house is silent now.

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAYS - NIGHT
</b>
	We TRACK through the house.  The CULTISTS, all Seventeen of
	them, stand in the passageways, looking toward Nix's sanctum.

	ON THE SANCTUM DOOR.  Butterfield emerges.  He is wearing
	WHITE now.

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		Do you wish him to be amongst us?

<b>				CULTISTS
</b>		Yes...

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		Will you come to him on your
		knees?

<b>				CULTISTS
</b>		Yes...

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		Be ready.

	Now we see that the Cultists have BOTTLES in their hands. 
	With looks of ecstatic fervour on their faces, they SMASH the
	bottles to the ground at their bare feet. Then they pick up
	MORE BOTTLES, and SMASH them, littering the ground with razor
	sharp pieces of GLASS. 

	ON Butterfield, smiling.  He steps back into the Sanctum.

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT
</b>
	HIGH, WIDE SHOT of the room, as Butterfield approaches the
	BODY of Nix.  It lies on a table, surrounded by bowls of OIL. 
	Bandages, soaked in oil, are laid over its limbs.  Beside its
	head, Butterfield's INSTRUMENTS are laid out. 

	ON Dorothea, crouched in the corner of the room, terrified as
	she watches Butterfield remove the multi- part MASK screwed
	into Nix's face.  He works with surgical precision.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		Listen.  You've got everything you
		want.  You don't need me. .. 

	A piece of the mask comes away from the cheek.  A subtle
	POWER plucks at dust around the room, disturbing it minutely. 
	We CUT CLOSE to Dorothea's face throughout this sequence (on
	occasion her eyeball fills the screen) as she sees these
	signs of disturbance in the ether, growing in magnitude.

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		No, but he will.  After what you
		did to him.

	He pulls a piece of the mask from Nix's mouth.

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		He'll want vengeance.  Simple PS
		that.

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAYS - NIGHT
</b>
	The bottle-breaking has ceased.  The Cultists stand,
	breathless with anticipation.

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT
</b>
	On Nix's emaciated mouth.  The lips TWITCH. 

	On Dorothea.  The DUST moves around her. 

	And Nix DRAWS BREATH. 

	On Butterfield, TEARS in his eyes.

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		Oh my Lord.  He's coming home...

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT
</b>
	The whisper runs through the congregation:

<b>				CULTISTS
</b>		He's coming home... he/s coming
		home...

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT
</b>
	ON Dorothea, eyes wide.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		Christ in Heaven.

	ON Nix, as his body starts to thirstily soak up the oils. 
	His withered flesh starts to REHYDRATE; his veins start to
<b>	THROB. 
</b>
	Butterfield is watching the process in amazement. Nix's HANDS
	move up to his face, where the last portion of the mask is
	still screwed over his eyes.

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		He's with us...

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT
</b>
<b>				CULTISTS
</b>		He's with us... He's with us...

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT
</b>
	Unnoticed by Butterfield, who has his eyes on Nix, Dorothea
	gets to her feet and creeps away to the door. Very quiet
<b>	TRACK. 
</b>
	Suddenly, the snake-handling Cultist steps into view, snakes
	coiled around his face and fingers!

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		Oh God!

	Butterfield looks up. 

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		Hold her!

	On Nix, as he starts to pull at the mask on his face.  It
	comes away with a moist, WRENCHING SOUND.  At last, we see
	his eyes.

<b>	NIX'S P.O.V.
</b>
	The candle-lights blaze, BLINDING his sensitive eyes.

<b>				NIX
</b>			(fury to agony)
		Aaarrrgh!

	He gets up and flings himself around the room, knocking over
	all the lights but two.  Then he strikes Butterfield to the
	ground, and slams his foot on Butterfield's neck, knocking
	him unconscious.  It's a terrifying, almost demoniacal
	display of instant physical superiority.  Throughout, he
	literally ROARS in rage.

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT
</b>
	The Cultists SCREAM in sympathy, letting out years of
	repressed frustration.  Many of them are dancing on the
	shards of glass now, crazed.

<b>				CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	EXT. DESERT NEAR NIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
	Harry's car is parked a quarter mile from Nix's house. He is
	getting out.  Swann stays put. 

	The SOUND of SCREAMING is carried towards them on the wind.

<b>				HARRY
</b>			(spooked)
		Jesus... what the hell's going on
		in there?

<b>				SWANN
</b>		At a guess... they just resurrected
		him.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Fuck.

	Harry starts towards the house. After a beat, Swann gets out
	of the car and follows.

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM- - NIGHT
</b>
	On Butterfield, as Nix removes his foot.  Butterfield is out
	for the count. 

	On Nix, as he stops screaming.  His face is grotesquely
	disfigured by the mask, the flesh stained and corrupted. 

	The SCREAMING of the Cultists is dying away.

<b>				NIX
</b>		Children...

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT
</b>
	The Cultists all face the Sanctum door, awaiting instruction.

<b>				NIX
</b>		Will you suffer to come unto me?

	One by one, the Cultists fall to their knees.  We never see
	flesh pierced by broken glass.  But we HEAR IT, and see the
	agony on the Cultist's faces.  They start to sob.

	Then, Nix appears in the doorway, mostly hidden by shadow.

<b>				NIX
</b>		I've come back to share the wisdom
		of the grave.  Will you hear it?

<b>				CULTISTS
</b>		Yes... yes...

<b>				NIX
</b>		Follow me then.

	He steps out of the doorway.  The Cultists let out sobs of
	adoration.  Nix locks at Dorothea.

<b>				NIX
</b>		Do I know you, child?

	He reaches for her.  Pulls her close to his body. Dorothea
	keeps her self-possession; but only just.

<b>				NIX
</b>		Oh yes... I do, don't I?  No gun
		this time, child?
			(a beat)
		Where's Swann?

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		I don't know where he is.

	Nix picks her up, so that her feet are inches off the ground.


<b>				NIX
</b>		He'll come.  We've got unfinished
		business, he and I.

	Then he carries her down the passageway to the Meditation
	Room, walking on the glass, apparently indifferent to the
	wounds he's receiving. 

	The Cultists follow.

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Nix strides into the middle of the room.

<b>				NIX
</b>			(whispered to Dorothea)
		Something terrible's going to
		happen.  But if you hold on to me,
		very tight, you may live a little
		longer.

	The Cultists enter the room, knees and hands BLOODY.

<b>				NIX
</b>			(to Cultists)
		Are you ready for my wisdom?

<b>				CULTISTS
</b>		Tell us... tell us...

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT
</b>
	Harry pushes open the window, and climbs in.  Swann follows. 
	He is frozen by the memory of what happened here. 

	ON SWANN, as the TRACK fills with eerie ECHOES of that
	terrible event.  Nix's SCREAMS.  The GUN-SHOTS.  The sound of
	the SCREWS GRINDING into Nix's flesh.

<b>				SWANN
</b>			(in terrified awe)
		This is where we killed him.

<b>				HARRY
</b>			(looking at table)
		You didn't try hard enough.

<b>				SWANN
</b>		I can't... I can't go any
		further...

	Harry nods, and gently detaches his arm from Swann's panicked
	grip.  He crosses to the door. 

	Suddenly. Butterfield reaches out of the darkness, and
	catches hold of Harry's leg. throwing him to the ground. 

	He has one of the INSTRUMENTS in his hand.  He STABS at
	Harry, striking the ground between Harry's legs.

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
<b>				NIX
</b>		Here is my wisdom.

	He stamps on the ground.  CRACKS spread from his foot in all
	directions. ON THE CULTISTS, amazed by this manifestation of
	power.

<b>				BARBARA
</b>		Show us. Puritan.

<b>				NORMAN
</b>		Yes, show us!

<b>				ALL
</b>		Show us!  Show us!

	With a ROAR, a PIT four or five feet across opens up beneath
	Nix and Dorothea.  Nix HOVERS over it.  It's utterly dark;
	perhaps bottomless. 

	Dorothea SCREAMS!

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM- - NIGHT
</b>
	Hearing Dorothea's CRY, Harry looks back towards the
	passageway.  Butterfield pulls the instrument out of the
	ground and stabs at Harry a second time.  But Swann catches
	hold of his arm.

<b>				SWANN
</b>			(to Harry)
		Whatever he's doing to her, stop
		him!

	And Harry's up and away --

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT
</b>
	-- he dashes over the glass --

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	On Nix, Dorothea clasped close to him.  He REVOLVES as he
	floats over the chasm below then.

<b>				NIX
</b>			(to unseen Cultists)
		You see, I escaped the grave. So I
		have to give something to the grave
		in return.

	On the Cultists, listening to their lord with love in their
	eyes. 

	A SLIT OPENS in the middle of Nix's forehead, above the
	bridge of his nose (this is an image we saw in the prints in
	the library), and from it comes a WAVE OF DARKNESS.  As Nix
	REVOLVES, the darkness STRIKES the GROUND around the
	Cultists.

	At first they don't realize what's going on.  They think this
	is some kind of bizarre blessing. 

	Then the ground starts to LIQUIFY beneath them.

<b>				NORMAN
</b>		What's happening?

<b>				NIX
</b>		I have to give something back. So
		I'm giving you.

	They're starting to SCREAM now as they sink into the ground. 
	They struggle, of course, but the earth seems to be hungry
	for them.  They are dragged down, THRASHING as they SINK.

<b>				BARBARA
</b>			(sobbing)
		Why?  Why?

<b>				NIX
</b>		You're not worthy.  None of you. 
		Only Swann was worthy. You just
		waited like lambs.

	Harry appears in the doorway.  Nix, still swinging round, has
	his back to Harry.

<b>				NIX
</b>		Well I'm not your shepherd.

	Harry surveys the horrific scene in front of him.  The ground
	is now re-solidifying around the Cultists, some of whom have
	disappeared from view completely, some of whom still reach up
	out of the dirt.  The scene has a surreal beauty to it
	despite its horror.  SCREAMING FACES locked in the solid
	ground.  TWITCHING HANDS the same. Harry starts towards Nix
	and Dorothea, GUN levelled.  So far, he has avoided Nix's
	gaze.

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT
</b>
	Butterfield and Swann are locked in a life-or-death struggle. 
	They tumble back against the table upon which Nix was
	resurrected.  It collapses under them, and for a moment Swann
	is stunned.  Butterfield snatches up one of the instruments
	and STABS at Swann, who rolls out of the way in the nick of
	time. 

	The BLADE catches him in the arm, however.

<b>				SWANN
</b>		Aah!

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		Go on, bleed.
			(he slashes at Swann
		again)
		Go on!  Go on!

	Butterfield comes after him, and Swann backs off against a
	wall.  He SPITS out a serpentine FLAME, which races across
	the floor and leaps at Butterfield's face!

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>			(screaming)
		No!

	He falls backwards, his face ON FIRE.  Swann doesn't wait to
	watch him die, but races out into the passageway, BLOOD
	running from his wound.

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Harry is staring up at Dorothea as he very gingerly crosses
	the still-sticky ground.  He's a yard from the edge of the
	pit now. 

	Nix swings round.

<b>				NIX
</b>		You're not Swann.  Who are you?
			(a beat) )
		Oh... I know what you want. He lets
		Dorothea slip from his arms.  

	Harry flings himself towards the hole and CATCHES HOLD of
	Dorothea's arm before she falls away into the abyss.  His GUN
	goes spinning across the ground, back towards the door
	leading to the passageway.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		Oh God!

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Hang on!

	Nix reaches down to torment Harry.  But before he can make
	contact

<b>				SWANN (V.O.)
</b>		Nix!

	Nix looks up.

<b>				NIX
</b>		There you are. 

	Suddenly, Nix isn't interested in Harry and Dorothea. He
	steps onto solid ground, and walks towards Swann, his tone
	suddenly conversational.

<b>				NIX
</b>		I've had a lot of time to think
		about you.  Where I went wrong...

	With Nix's back turned, Harry pulls Dorothea back out of the
	chasm.

<b>				SWANN
</b>		And?

<b>				NIX
</b>		I should have been honest with you,
		right from the start.  I wasn't
		born to show people the error of
		their ways.  I was born to murder
		the world.

	ON HARRY, as he leads Dorothea to the door.  Harry glances
	back into the room.

<b>				NIX
</b>		You could still help me do that.

<b>				SWANN
</b>		Why would I want to?

<b>				NIX
</b>		Because you've got nothing else to
		live for.

<b>				SWANN
</b>		Not true.

<b>				NIX
</b>		The woman has a new love in her
		life.  Your friends are dead.
		Nobody's left to save you, but me

	He lays his hands on Swann.  Draws him into an embrace.

	ON HARRY and Dorothea.

<b>				HARRY
</b>			(to Dorothea)
		I've got to help him.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		You can't.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Nix has got to have a weak spot. 
		Everybody's got a fucking weak
		spot.

	A NOISE. He turns, and suddenly --

	Butterfield is there!  His face is horribly burned, but he's
	still very much alive.

<b>				BUTTERFIELD
</b>		Bastard!

	He launches himself at Harry, driving them both back into the
	BROKEN GLASS.  A FIGHT ensues, carrying them out into the
	Passageway. 

	Nix has Swann in a bear-hug.

<b>				NIX
</b>		Will you help me? 

	A beat.  Then Swann nods.

<b>				SWANN
</b>		Yes.

	Nix lets him go.

<b>				NIX
</b>		You know I'll kill you when we're
		done.  I have to.

<b>				SWANN
</b>		Yes.

<b>				NIX
</b>		But until then... it's you and
		me... the way it always was.

<b>				SWANN
</b>		Yes.

	Dorothea, at the doorway, watches this bizarre exchange.
	Swann's eyes flicker towards her.  Nix turns.

<b>				NIX
</b>		Wait... you still feel something
		for that bitch?

<b>				SWANN
</b>		No!

<b>				NIX
</b>		Liar!

	Nix makes a gesture, and Swann is flung against the wall,
	pinned there like a fly, legs off the ground.

<b>				NIX
</b>		Will!  You!  Never!  Learn!?

	With each word, Nix almost casually throws a gesture in
	Swann's direction, and though there is six feet between them,
	they have the force of terrible blows.  One to the ribs. 
	They CRACK.  One to the face.  It BLEEDS.  One to the legs,
	one to the arms.  They all BREAK.  Then Nix turns towards
	Dorothea.

<b>				NIX
</b>		She's just flesh, Swannnie-boy.
		I'll show you!

	He moves towards Dorothea.  Swann falls to the ground,
	broken.

<b>				SWANN
</b>		Harry!

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT
</b>
	The fight between Butterfield and Harry continues.

<b>				SWANN (V.O.)
</b>		Harry!  Stop him!

	Harry looks up.  Sees Dorothea retreating from the door, and
	running off into the darkness. 

	Butterfield comes at Harry again.  Harry's got no more time
	for this creep.  He delivers Butterfield a backhand swipe,
	and Butterfield lands face down in the glass.  We don't see
	the impact.  HEARING it's enough. 

	Harry looks down at the body.  Then --

<b>				NIX (V.O.)
</b>		Where is she? 

	Harry turns.

	Nix is on him like a luoaernaut. treading on Butterfield's
	body as he comes at Harry!

<b>				NIX
</b>		Where did she go?

	Nix GRABS hold of Harry's head with one hand and PRESSES the
	fingers of -the other hand against Harry's TEMPLES. He
	struggles to get free, but Nix is simply too powerful.

	Nix's fingers slowly SLIDE BENEATH the skin of Harry's
	temples.  As before, there's no blood.

<b>				NIX
</b>		You've got Swann's disease. You
		think a little courage, a little
		love, and it'll all be all right. 
		Wrong!

	His fingers slide all the way in!

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Oh God!

	Harry wrests himself free of Nix, and stumbles away. His eyes
	are BLOOD-RED.  Nix is a few yards behind him.

<b>				NIX
</b>		Tell me where she is... and I'll
		make it go away...

	Harry is reeling around in the grip of a nightmare.

<b>	HARRY'S P.O.V.
</b>
	The apocalyptic images on the walls seem to move!  A face
	SCREAMS!  FIRE blossoms! 

	ON HARRY, verging on insanity.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Oh God... oh God...

<b>	HARRY'S P.O.V.
</b>
	Harry sees a WOMAN, wrapped in the sickly-sensual embrace of
	some glistening, barely visible OBSCENITY.  We can't see her
	face.  Only her mouth is visible in the coils of her
	devourer.

<b>	ON HARRY
</b>
	as he approaches the wall, on which this woman is painted. 
	Reaching out for the image.

<b>	HARRY'S P.O.V.
</b>
	The Woman reaches for Harry.

<b>				WOMAN           
</b>		Help me.

<b>	ON HARRY
</b>
	as he touches the wall.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Dorothea!

	He starts to SCRATCH out the plaster on which the image is
	painted.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Dorothea!  Dorothea!

<b>	HARRY'S P.O.V.
</b>
	Darkness swallows the image of the woman.  She is still
	screaming when she disappears.

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	ON SWANN, dragging his broken body to the door.

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT
</b>
<b>	ON HARRY 
</b>
	literally beating his head against the wall!

<b>				HARRY
</b>		No!  No!  No!

<b>				DOROTHEA (V.O.)
</b>		Harry...

	Harry stops.  Dare he believe this is truly her voice?

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		It's not real, Harry-

	Harry turns around.  Dorothea is there.

<b>	HARRY'S P.O.V.
</b>
	For a moment, he sees Dorothea as she is.

	ON HARRY, relief flooding his face.  Then --

<b>	HARRY'S P.O.V.
</b>
	-- the image MORPHS.  Dorothea's beauty is replaced by
	primeval muck. 

	ON HARRY, appalled.  Dorothea grabs hold of him.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		Harry.  Listen to me. Whatever's
		good between us, believe it.

	Harry's face is deathly white, and pouring SWEAT.  He's
	fighting the delirium.  Or doing his best.


<b>				HARRY
</b>		... oh... God...

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		I'm here, Harry.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		...yes?

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		Yes.

	Nix steps from the shadows of the doorway behind Harry.

<b>				NIX
</b>			(to Dorothea)
		There you are, child. 

	Harry starts to look round.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		Don't look.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		I... have... to.

<b>				NIX
</b>		Come on, child.  I want Swann to
		see you die. 

	Harry turns and looks at Nix.

<b>	HARRY'S P.O.V.
</b>
	Nix's face darkens as it MORPHS.  And the flesh in the middle
	of his brow UNFOLDS, revealing a dark, pulsating THIRD EYE.

<b>				NIX
</b>			(to Harry)
		What are you looking at?

	ON DOROTHEA, who has gone to the door of the Meditation Room
	and now slips inside. 

	ON HARRY, staring up at Nix.

	ON DOROTHEA, re-emerging from the Meditation Room.  In her
	hand, Harry's GUN.  Harry looks round at her.

<b>				HARRY
</b>			(points to his brow)
		There... there!

	ON NIX, as he looks up at Dorothea. 

	ON DOROTHEA, as she raises the GUN.  She FIRES. 

	The bullet STRIKES Nix's FOREHEAD.  He sinks to his knees,
	BLOOD pouring down his face from the hole where his third EYE
	used to be.

	ON HARRY, as Nix's mind-hold falters.  He leans against the
	wall, shaking.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		Harry?

<b>				HARRY
</b>		I'm okay.  I'm okay.

	Harry opens his eyes.  Looks up at her.

<b>	HARRY'S P.O.V.
</b>
	The last of the MORPHING fades.  He sees Dorothea as she
	actually is.  Dorothea goes down to comfort him, and they
	embrace. 

	Suddenly, a ROAR from Nix.  They look towards him --

	-- it isn't over. 

	One last, terrifying transformation is overtaking Nix as he
	kneels in the GLASS.  His sallow flesh is running in STREAMS
	up his body towards the DARK HOLE in the middle of his
	forehead --

<b>				NIX
</b>		One... last... illusion...

	-- his humanity is disappearing, vanishing into the vortex of
	the bullet wound.

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		Oh my God.

	Harry and Dorothea start to get up... 

	Nix is no longer human.  He is a shape of gleaming DARKNESS,
	stripped of features.  He opens his mouth, the only visible
	element on his body is his toothed maw, which looses an
	utterly inhuman SHRIEK!

<b>				SWANN (V.O.)
</b>		... D'Amour...

	Harry glances through the door into the Meditation Room.
	Swann is on the threshold. 

	Nix RISES now.  He is a terrifying spectacle, his bulk
	somehow more intimidating than ever in this simplified form. 

	He comes at Dorothea, who has no choice but to back away into
	the Meditation Room.

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	The pit still yawns in the middle of the floor. Dorothea is
	backed towards it by Nix. 

	When Nix SPEAKS, his voice is not remotely human.  It is
<b>	DEMONIACAL.
</b>
<b>				NIX
</b>		I am the purest of the pure.  I am
		the darkest of the dark...

	Harry is at the door now, starting towards Nix.

<b>				SWANN
</b>		Harry.  You can't kill him. 

	Harry crouches beside Swann.

<b>				HARRY
</b>			(whispers)
		He did something with the ground.

<b>				SWANN
</b>		Yes?

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Can you do it?

<b>				SWANN
</b>		I don't know.

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Try.

	ON DOROTHEA.  She's a couple of yards from the pit now.

<b>				NIX (V.O.)
</b>		I'm beyond Heaven.  I'm beyond
		Hell.

	Suddenly, Harry lunges at Nix, grabbing hold of his legs. 
	Nix topples.

	ON SWANN, who puts his hands on the ground.  Closes his eyes. 

	A wave of LIQUIFICATION runs through the ground from Swann's
	broken fingers -- 

	-- the Cultists' bodies MOVE in the softening ground, like
	corpses in surf, and ROLL towards the pit, their dead faces
	resurfacing --

	Barbara's body floats past Nix, and disappears over       
	the edge of the pit.

<b>				HARRY
</b>			(to Dorothea)
		Get out of here!

	The ground is very liquid now, and the corpses are lodging
	around Nix as they're all carried towards the pit.  So's
	Harry, of course. 

	Nix tries to get up, but he's too late.  The corpses weigh
	him down, the ground is too fluid for him to get a proper
	hold, and Harry still clings to his legs.

<b>				NIX
</b>		No!  No!  No!

	He's at the edge of the pit.

<b>				DOROTHEA (V.O.)
</b>		Harry!

	Harry looks round.  Dorothea's behind him, risking the
	flowing ground to offer him a hand. 

	Nix starts to fall into the pit.  At the last minute, he
	reaches for Harry, as -- 

	-- Harry is pulled out of reach bv Dorothea. 

	Together they stumble to THE DOOR, where Swann still lies. 
	They look back to see 

	NIX, as he goes over the edge of the pit and FALLS SCREAMING. 

	At the door, Dorothea lifts up Swann's head.  He's dead. She
	closes his eyes.

<b>				CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT. THE PIT
</b>
	What we are about to witness is the longest fall-to-his-
	death by any villain in the history of cinema... 

	Nix is falling through rock.  Still SCREAMING.  He CRASHES
	against a layer of stone, which his body smashes to
	smithereens.  And as he falls --

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT
</b>
<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		Is it finished?

<b>				HARRY
</b>		I think so.

	No it's not.  Nix keeps falling, breaking through another
	layer of rock as he descends deeper and deeper into the
	earth. 

	And now... there's a hint of FIERY LIGHT below.  He's
	approaching MAGMA.

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT
</b>
<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		Come on...

	She puts her arms around him.  Kisses him, sobbing with
	relief.

<b>	INT. THE PIT
</b>
	Nix hits a layer of molten rock, and, SCREAMING, he
	disappears.  A BURST of dark, roiling ENERGY erupts from the
	spot where he sank, and starts up the pit --

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	The room TREMBLES.  There's a ROAR in the earth.

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT
</b>
<b>				HARRY
</b>		What the fuck? 

<b>				DOROTHEA
</b>		Harry-?

<b>				HARRY
</b>		Out!  Out! 

	They race for the front door --

<b>	INT. THE PIT
</b>
	-- the wave of ENERGY, like a howling, dark WIND, ascends at
	a breath-taking rate

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT
</b>
	Harry and Dorothea race for the open air, as

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	The ENERGY ERUPTS from the pit.

<b>	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
</b>
	Harry and Dorothea stumble out, into the night --

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - VARIOUS - NIGHT
</b>
	The ENERGY howls from room to room, ERODING the images off
	the walls, BLOWING out the doors, DESTROYING all the
	resurrection equipment in the Sanctum --

<b>	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DESERT - DAWN
</b>
	Harry and Dorothea stumble to the car.  They look back at the
	house, as the cacophony of destruction dies down. 

	ON THE RIM OF THE SUN, as it peeps over the desert horizon.

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - VARIOUS - DAWN
</b>
	The SUNLIGHT creeps through the rooms as the DUST settles.

<b>	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - DAWN
</b>
	The hole in the floor CLOSES UP, and is SEALED... SILENCE
	reigns.

<b>	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DESERT - DAWN
</b>
	Harry and Dorothea get into the car.  Harry glances back at
	the house.  Nothing.

<b>				HARRY
</b>			(quietly)
		It's finished.

<b>	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - IDOLS - DAWN
</b>
	ON THE IDOLS and the FRONT DOOR, virtually destroyed by tine.

<b>	WE DRIFT THROUGH THEM, INTERCUTTING WITH:
</b>
<b>	EXT. HARRY'S CAR - DESERT ROAD - DAWN			   
</b>
	Harry's car speeds away, leaving a plume of dust as
