In Manhattan, behind six locks, lives Max Cohen, a mathematician and computer whiz.
Since staring at the sun at age six, he's had terrible headaches; plus, he can't abide human contact except with an aging professor, and he's obsessed with finding numeric patterns.
His current obsession is the stock market; his theories bring him to the attention of Wall Street traders.
He also keeps running into Lenny, a fast-talking Chasidic who fronts for a cabal that wants to rediscover long-lost mathematical mysteries in the Torah.
Neither group is benign, and they pursue Max as his hallucinations and headaches worsen.
Does nature offer any solutions?
Can Max find them?
