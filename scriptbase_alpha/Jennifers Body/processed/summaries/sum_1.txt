In Devil's Kettle, Minnesota, Needy is a shy teenage student that idolizes her cheerleader friend Jennifer, who is very arrogant.
They attend a performance of the rock 'n' roll band Low Shoulder at a bar, and the band leader overhears that Jennifer is a virgin.
When the place is set on fire, Jennifer is abducted by the band in their van.
Later she appears at Needy's home, covered in blood, throwing up a dark liquid and with a weird behavior.
Over the next few days, many male classmates are found murdered with eaten parts of their bodies.
Needy discovers that Jennifer was sacrificed by the band members in a black magic ritual, but something went wrong because Jennifer was not a virgin and she transformed into a flesh-eating succubus.
Needy tries to keep her boyfriend Chip away from Jennifer.
