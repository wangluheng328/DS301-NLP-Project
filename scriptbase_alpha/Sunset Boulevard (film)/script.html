<b>	SUNSET BOULEVARD
</b>

  Charles Brackett
  Billy Wilder
  D.M. Marshman, Jr.

  March 21,1949



<b>                         SEQUENCE "A"  
</b>

  A-l-4   START the picture with the actual street sign:
          SUNSET BOULEVARD, stencilled on a curbstope.
          In the gutter lie dead leaves, scraps of paper,
          burnt matches and cigarette butts.  It is early
          morning.

          Now the CAMERA leaves the sign and MOVES EAST, the
          grey asphalt of the street filling the screen.  As
          speed accelerates to around 40 m.p.h., traffic de-
          marcations, white arrows, speed-limit warnings, man-
          hole covers, etc., flash by.  SUPERIMPOSED on all
          this are the CREDIT TITLES, in the stencilled style
          of the street sign.

          Over the scene we now hear         MAN'S VOICE
          sirens.  Police squad cars    Yes, this is Sunset
          hurtle toward the camera,     Boulevard, Los Angeles,
          turn off the road into a      California.  It's about
          driveway with squealing       five o'clock in the
          brakes.  Dismounted motor-    morning.  That's the
          cycle cops stand directing    Homicide Squad, com-
          the cars in.                  plete with detectives
                                        and newspaper men.

                                        hear the facts, the

          chair, is a portable
          typewriter.  Beside
          him, on the bed, is a
          dirty ashtray and a
          scattering of type
          written and pencil-
          marked pages.  Gillis
          is typing.  with a
          pencil clenched bet-

<b>  A-8     JOE GILLIS' APARTMENT
</b>
          It is a one-room affair with an unmade Murphy bed
          pulled out of the wall at which Gillis sits typing.
          There are a couple of worn-out plush chairs and a
          Spanish-style, wrought-iron standing lamp.  Also a
          small desk littered with books and letters, and a
          chest of drawers with a portable phonograph and some
          records on top.  On the walls are a couple of repro-
          ductions of characterless paintings, with laundry
          bills and snapshots stuck in the frames.  Through an
          archway can he seen a tiny kitchenette, complete with
          unwashed coffee pot and cup, empty tin cans, orange
          peels, etc.  The effect is dingy and cheerless --
          just another furnished apartment.  The buzzer SOUNDS.

<b>                            GILLIS
</b>                 Yeah.

          The buzzer SOUNDS again.  Gillis gets up and opens
          the door.  Two men wearing hats stand outside one of
          them carrying a briefcase.

          It is in the style of a Paramount executive's office --
          mahogany, leather, and a little chintz.  On the
          walls are some large framed photographs of Paramount
          stars, with dedications to Mr. Sheldrake.  Also a
          couple of framed critics' awards certificates, and an
          Oscar on a bookshelf.  A shooting schedule chart is
          thumb-tacked into a large bulletin board.  There are
          piles or scripts, a few pipes and, somewhere in the
          background, some set models.

                                located that agent of mine, the
                                big faker.  Was he out digging
                                up a job for poor Joe Gillis?
                                Hmph! He was hard at work in
                                Bel Air, making with the golf
                                clubs.

          Gillis hangs up with a curse, opens the door of the
          booth, emerges, wiping the sweat from his forehead.
          He walks toward the exit.  He is stopped by the
          voice of

</b>                 Hello, Gillis.

          Gillis looks around.  At the fountain sits Skolsky,
          drinking a cup of coffee.

          On a sun-dappled green edged with tall sycamores,
          stands Morino, the agent, a caddy and a nondescript
          opponent in the background.  Gillis has evidently
          stated his problem already.

          direction.  In it are the two finance company men.

          He is driving as fast as he dares, keeping an eye out

          It is grandiose and grim.  The whole place is one of
          those abortions of silent-picture days, with bowling
          alleys in the cellar and a built-in pipe organ, and
          beams imported from Italy, with California termites
          at work on them.  Portieres are drawn before all the
          windows, and only thin slits or sunlight find their
          way in to fight the few electric bulbs which are always
          burning.



          Gillis starts up the curve of the black marble
          staircase.  It has a wrought-iron rail and a worn
          velvet rope along the wall.

          The oddity of the situation has caught Gillis'
          imagination.  He climbs the stairs with a kind of
          morbid fascination.  At the top he stops, undecided,
          then turns to the right and is stopped by

          Gillis swings around.

          Norma Desmond stands down the corridor next to a
          doorway from which emerges a flickering light.  She
          is a little woman.  There is a curious style, a
          great sense of high voltage about her.  She is dress-
          ed in black house pyjamas and black high-heeled
          pumps.  Around her throat there is a leopard-pat-
          terned scarf, and wound around her head a turban of
          the same material.  Her skin is very pale, and she
          is wearing dark glasses.

                 table in front of the fire.  He
                 always liked fires and poking at
                 them with a stick.

          Gillis enters the SHOT and she leads him into


<b>  A-32    NORMA DESMOND'S BEDROOM
</b>
          It is a huge, gloomy room hung in white brocade which
          has beconle dirty over the years and even slightly
          torn in a few places.  There's a great, unmade gilded
          bed in the shape of a swan, from which the gold had
          begun to peel.  There is a disorder of clothes and
          negligees and faded photographs of old-time stars
          about.

          In an imitation baroque fireplace some logs are burn-
          ing.  On the massage table before it lies a small
          form shrouded under a Spanish shawl.  At each end on
          a baroque pedestal stands a three-branched cande-
          labrum, the candles lighted.

                 White, or deep pink.

          She picks up the shawl to make up her mind about the
          color.  From under the shawl flops down a dead arm.
          Gillis stares and recoils a little.  It is like a
          child's arm, only black and hairy.

                 Gay.  Let's make it gay.

          Gillis edges closer and glances down.  Under the
          shawl he sees the sad, bearded face of a dead
          chimpanzee.  Norma drops back the shawl.

                 wide world.  But that wasn't good
                 enough.  Oh, nol They wanted the
                 ears of the world, too.  So they
                 opened their big mouths, and out

          Norma starts down the stairs.

          Norma has reached him at the bottom of the staircase.

<b>                            NORMA
</b>                 I want to ask you something.
                 Come in here.

          She leads him into


<b>  A-33    THE HUGE LIVING ROOM
</b>
          It is dark and damp and filled with black oak and
          red velvet furniture which looks like crappy props
          from the Mark of Zorro set.  Along the main wall,
          a gigantic fireplace has been freezing for years.
          On the gold piano is a galaxy of photographs of
          Norma Desmond in her various roles.  On one wall
          is a painting -- a California Gold Rush scene,
          Carthay Circle school.  (We will learn later that
          it hides a motion picture screen.)

          One corner is filled with a large pipe organ, and
          as Norma and Gillis enter, there is a grizzly
          moaning sound.  Gillis looks around.

<b>                            NORMA
</b>                 The wind gets in that blasted
                 pipe organ.  I ought to have
                 it taken out.

<b>                            GILLIS
</b>                 Or teach it a better tune.

          Norma has led him to the card tables which stand
          side by side near a window.  They are piled high
          with papers scrawled in a large, uncertain hand.

<b>                            NORMA
</b>                 How long is a movie script these
                 days?  I mean, how many pages?

<b>                            GILLIS
</b>                 Depends on what it is -- a Donald
                 Duck or Joan or Arc.

<b>                            NORMA
</b>                 This is to be a very important
                 picture.  I have written it

                 who have never forgiven me for
                 deserting the screen.

<b>                            GILLIS

                 a Holy man.  She dances the Dance
                 of the Seven Veils.  He rejects
                 her, so she demands his head on a
                 golden tray, kissing his cold, dead
                 lips.

          He leaves.  Norma turns to Gillis again.

<b>                            NORMA
</b>                 I said sit down.

          There is compulsion in her voice.

          Gillis looks at her                   GILLIS' VOICE
          and starts slowly          Well.  I had no pressing

                                     tioned something to drink..

                                     glasses, defying me not to

          Gillis puts down a batch of script.  There is a

          It is obviously a man's room -- heavy Spanish

                 up all the tickets for a perfor-
                 mance at the Metropolitan and sat
                 there listening to La Traviata,
                 all by himself.  He was afraid of
                 catching cold.

                 folding the orchestra and smash-
                 ing champagne glasses on Max's

<b>                            GILLIS
</b>                 A little.

<b>                            NORMA
</b>                 Is it funny that I'm in love
                 with you?

                 with you all along.

          They dance on.  Gillis is acutely embarrassed.
          THE CAMERA SLOWLY PULLS BACK, PANS past the faces
          of the musicians, who play on with a rather overe-
          mphasized lack of interest.  Finally it winds up
          on Max, behind the buffet.  He stands watching Gillis,
          a faint trace of pity in his eyes.

          NORMA AND GILLIS sitting on a couch in front of the
          cavernous fireplace.  Norma holds out her cigarette
          to Gillis, who lights it.

          Gillis snaps open the case.  Engraved inside the
          cover is: TO JOE FROM NORMA, and two bars of
          music.

                 What you're trying to say is
                 that you don't want me to love
                 you.  Is that it?

          Gillis doesn't answer.  Norma slaps his face and
          rushes from the room and upstairs.

          Gillis stands paralyzed, the slap burning his cheek.


<b>  C-1O    THE TOP OF THE STAIRCASE AND CORRIDOR
</b>
          Norma rushes up the last few steps, down the corridor
          and into her bedroom, banging the door.  MOVE THE
          CAMERA toward the closed door, centering on the
          gouged-out lock.


<b>  C-11    GILLIS, IN THE BIG ROOM
</b>
          He still stands motionless.  He glances around fur-
          tively, to see if his humiliation has been observed.


<b>  C-12    THE ORCHESTRA
</b>
          The musicians are playing away.  They have turned
          their eyes away from Gillis rather too ostentatious-
          ly for comfort.


<b>  C-13    GILLIS
</b>
          His eyes move over toward


<b>  C-14    MAX
</b>
          He is subtler than the musicians.  He appears very
          busy at the buffet, putting empty bottles and used
          glasses on a tray.  He walks across the room with
          them.


<b>  C-15    GILLIS
</b>
          He starts slowly out.  As he does so his long gold
          key chain catches on a carved ornament of the sofa
          and holds him for a second of additional embarrass-
          ment.  He yanks it loose and walks with as much
          nonchalance as he can muster to


<b>  C-16    THE HALL
</b>
          Crossing towards the coat closet, Gillis throws a
          look upstairs.  Then he pulls the Vicuna coat from
          its hangar and slips into it as he crosses to the
          entrance door.  He opens the door on the darkness
          of the courtyard.

          Gillis shuts the door.           GILLIS'VOICE
          He takes a few steps       I didn't know where I was
          forward, then stands       going.  I just had to get
          for a while breathing      out of there.  I had to be
          deep.  The rain is         with people my own age.  I
          balm to that cheek         had to hear somebody laugh
          where the slap still a     again.  I thought of Artie
          burns.  He walks for-      Green.  There was bound to
          ward with a great          be a New Year's shindig
          sense of relief.           going on in his apartment

          	fun on the cuff.

          Gillis walks to the
          street, which is dark
          and empty.  He starts
          down Sunset in an
          Easterly direction.
          A car passes.  He
          tries to thumb a
          ride, without success.
          However, the second

          car, a florist's
          delivery wagon, stops.
          Gillis jumps in and the
          car drives off.

<b>  C-19    ARTIE GREEN'S APARTMENT
</b>
          It is the most modest one-room affair, jam packed
          with young people flowing over into the miniature
          bathroom and the microscopic kitchenette.  The only
          drink being served is punch from a pressed-glass
          bowl -- but everybody is having a hell of a time.
          Most of the men are in slacks and sweaters, and only
          a few of the girls in something that vaguely suggests
          party dress.

          Abe Burroughs sits at a small, guest-festooned piano
          and sings Tokio Rose.  By the door, a group of young
          men and girls respond to the song by sing1ng Rinso
          White or Dentyne Chewing Gum or something similar,
          in the manner of a Bach choral.  Artie Green, a dark
          haired, pleasant-looking guy in his late twenties,
          is conducting with the ladle from the punch bowl.

          The door behind some of the singers is pushed open,
          jostling them out of their places.  In comes Gillis,
          his hair and face wet, the collar of his Vicuna coat
          turned up.  Artie stops conducting, but the commer-
          cial goes right on.

<b>                            ARTIE

                 well-known screen writer, opium
                 smuggler and Black Dahlia suspect.

          Gillis greets some of the kids by name as he and
          Artie push their way into the room.

<b>                            ARTIE

<b>                            GILLIS

<b>                            ARTIE
</b>                 Come on.

          Artie starts peeling the coat off Gillis.  Its
          texture takes his breath away.

<b>                            ARTIE
</b>                 What is this - mink?

          He has taken the coat.  He looks at Gillis standing
          there in tails.

<b>                            ARTIE

<b>                            GILLIS
</b>                 Close, but no cigar.

          Gillis stands embarrassed While Artie rolls up the
          Vicuna coat and tucks it above the books on a book-
          shelf.

<b>                            ARTIE
</b>                 Say, you're not really smuggling
                 opium these days,  are you?

<b>                            GILLIS
</b>                 Where's the bar?

          The two make their way toward the punch bowl.  It's
          a little like running the gauntlet for Gillis.  There
          are whistles and 'stares of astonishlnent at his tails.
          When they reach the punch bowl, Artie picks up a
          half-filled glass and fills it.

<b>                            GILLIS

          Gillis squeezes his way through groups of people
          to the telephone, which is next to an open door
          leading to the bathroom.  The phone is busy.  A
          girl sits listening to it, giggling wildly.  Another
          girl beside her is laughing too.  They are apparently
          sharing a conversation with some man on the other end
          of the wire.  The telephone passes from hand to hand.
          Gillis watches impatiently, then

</b>                 When youlre through with that
                 thing, can I have it?

          The girl just nods, going on with her chattering.
          Gillis stands waiting, and Betty Schaefer comes up
          with his glass.

<b>                            BETTY
</b>                 You forgot this.

<b>                            GILLIS

<b>                            BETTY
</b>                 I've been hoping to run into you.

<b>                            GILLIS

<b>                            BETTY
</b>                 I felt a little guilty, so I got
                 out some of your old stories.

          They squeeze their way towards the bathroom, past

<b>                            BETTY
</b>                 This is shop talk.

          She and Gillis go through the open door into


<b>  C-20    ARTIE'S BATHROOM
</b>
          It's a little less noisy, although there are some
          guests there, chatting and having fun.  Betty and
          Gillis sit down on the edge of the tub.

<b>                            GILLIS
</b>                 Now if I got you correctly, there
                 was a short stretch of my fiction
                 you found worthy of notice.

<b>                            BETTY
</b>                 The flashback in the courtroom,
                 when she tells about being a
                 school teacher.

<b>                            GILLIS
</b>                 I had a teacher like that once.

<b>                            BETTY
</b>                 Maybe that's why it's good.
                 It's true, it's moving.  Now
                 why don't you use that character...

<b>                            GILLIS
</b>                 Who wants true? Who wants moving?

<b>                            BETTY
</b>                 Drop that attitude.  Here's some-
                 thing really worth while.

<b>                            GILLIS
</b>                 Want me to start right now?
                 Maybe there's some paper around.

<b>                            BETTY
</b>                 I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.

<b>                            GILLIS
</b>                 I've got some ideas myself.  One
                 of them being this is New Year's
                 Eve.  How about living it up a
                 little?

<b>                            BETTY
</b>                 As for instance?

<b>                            GILLIS
</b>                 Well....

<b>                            BETTY
</b>                 We could make some paper boats
                 and have a regatta.  Or should
                 we just turn on the shower?

<b>                            GILLIS
</b>                 How about capturing the kitchen
                 and barricading the door?

          One of the girls who was on the phone comes to

          He leaves.

          holding the instrument close to him as he dials
          a number.

          He hangs up the dead receiver, stands numb   with
          shock.  Betty elbows her way up to him, carrying
          the two punch glasses filled again.

                 lukewarm grape juice --

          Gillis looks up at her.  Without a word he pushes
          her aside so that she spills the drink.  He makes
          his way through the guests to the Vicuna coat, pulls
          it from the shelf, some books tumbling with it, and
          rushes towards the door and out.  Betty stands look-
          ing after him, completely bewildered.

          The doctor's car is parked in the driveway.  A taxi
          pulls up.  Gillis, in his Vicuna coat now, jumps
          out, throws a couple of dollars to the rdriver and
          runs toward the house.

          Max is opening the door to let out the doctor, a

          Only one alabaster lamp lights the big, cold room.
          On the bed lies Norma in her evening dress.  She is
          white as a sheet.  Her wrists are bandaged.  Her eyes
          are wide open, staring at the ceiling.  One of her
          shoes has halt slipped off her foot.  The other is
          on.  Gillis opens the door and stands there tor a
          second.  Then he slowly moves to the toot of the bed.
          He takes the shoes from her feet and puts them on
          the floor.

          Gillis walks slowly over to the mantelpiece, stands
          there for awhile.

          It is a sunny day.  The garden is in somewhat better
          shape.  The old house looks less unkept.  The pool

          face shielded by an enormous straw hat, her eyes by
          dark glasses.  Gillis, in bathing trunks, is on a
          rubber mattress in the pool.  Max comes to the

</b>                  Hey, Miss Desmond! Miss Desmond!

          She looks around her.

<b>                           VOICE
</b>                Up here!

          Norma looks up at the scaffolding.

          On the scaffold stands one of the electricians,
          next to his light.

          Norma waves at him.

<b>                           NORMA
</b>                Hello.

          Hog-eye points his light at her.

<b>                           HOG-EYE
</b>                Let's get a look at you.

          The beam of the lamp moves toward Norma.  It hits
          her.  She sits bathed in light.  A couple of old
          costume extras recognize her.

<b>                           EXTRAS
</b>                Say, it's Norma! Norma Desmond!

          They rush over and start wringing her hand.  Into
          the shot comes a middle-aged hairdresser.

<b>                           HAIRDRESSER
</b>                Hello, Miss Desmond.  It's Bessie.

          Some elderly electricians and stagehands move in.

          The first assistant brings the portable phone to

                 drove it on the lot the other day.
                 It looks just right for the Crosby

          Norma stills sits in the shaft of light, surrounded
          by about a dozen people who have come up to pay court.
          DeMille gestures up to Hog-eye and the light shifts
          away.  The people about Norma disperse slowly with
          various ad-libs.

                      (He sits down next to her)
                 I got hold of Gordon Cole.

          Norma hasn't heard a word.

<b>                            NORMA
</b>                 Did you see them? Did you see

                 lost your sense of humor ...

          Suddenly he realizes that she is crying.  She takes
          the handkerchief from his pocket and puts it over her
          eyes.

<b>                            DEMILLE

<b>                            NORMA
</b>                 Nothing.  I just didn't realize
                 what it would be like to come back
                 to the old studio.  I had no idea
                 how I'd missed it.

<b>                            DEMILLE
</b>                 We've missed you too, dear.

<b>                            NORMA
</b>                 We'll be working again, won't we, Chief?
                 We'll make our greatest picture.

<b>                            DEMILLE
</b>                 That's what I want to talk to you about.

<b>                            NORMA

</b>                 It's got a lot of good things.  Of
                 course, it would be an expensive picture...

<b>                            NORMA
</b>                 I don't care about the money.
                 I just want to work again.  You
                 don't know what it means to know

                 I remember my walls were covered
                 with black patent leather...

          The words "Readers' Department" have registered on

          Behind the desk sits Betty, typing the synopsis of
          a novel, a half-eaten apple marking her place.  The
          door behind her opens and Gillis enters.

<b>                            GILLIS
</b>                 Just so you don't think I'm a

                 anything in Dark Windows you
                 can use, take it.  It's all

<b>                            BETTY
</b>                 Well, for heaven's sake!

          She moves the book and the apple aside and points at
          the free space on the desk.

<b>                            BETTY

          Gillis sits on the desk.

<b>                            GILLIS
</b>                 I mean it.  It's no good to me
                 anyway.  Help yourself.

<b>                            BETTY
</b>                 Why should you do that?

<b>                            GILLIS
</b>                 If you get a hundred thousand for
                 it, you buy me a box of chocolate
                 creams.  If you get an Oscar, I

</b>                 See if they make sense.  To begin
                 with, I think you should throw out
                 all that psychological stuff --
                 exploring a killer's sick mind.

<b>                            GILLIS

                 their threadbare lives, their
                 struggles.  Here are people doing
                 the most important job in the
                 world, and they have to wprry
                 about getting enough money to
                 re-sole their shoes.  To me it
                 can be as exciting as any chase,
                 any gunplay.

<b>                            BETTY
</b>                 I'll make it short.

<b>                            GILLIS

<b>                            GILLIS

<b>                            BETTY

<b>                            GILLIS
</b>                 Good for you.  You've got yourself
                 the best guy in town.

<b>                            BETTY
</b>                 I think so.  They're on location
                 in Arizona, shooting a Western.
                 I'm free every evening, every week-
                 end.  If you want, we could work at
                 your place.

<b>                            GILLIS

                 each other, but they share the same
                 room.  It's cheaper that way.  As a
                 matter of fact, they sleep in the
                 same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.

<b>                            BETTY

<b>                            BETTY
</b>                 Came  on back.  Let me show you
                 where it fits in.

          Windows.

          Betty picks up the apple and is about to throw it
          after him.

          a glass coffee machine.  Gillis
          seats himself in her chair

<b>                             BETTY
</b>                   I was born just two blocks from
                   this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove
                   Avenue.  Father was head elec-
                   trician here till he died.  Mother
                   still works in Wardrobe.

</b>                   Third.  Grandma did stunt work
                   for Pearl White.  I come from a
                   picture family.  Naturally they
                   took it for granted I was to become
                   a great star.  So I had ten years of
                   dramatic lessons, diction, dancing.
                   Then the studio made a test.  Well,
                   they didn't like my nose -- it slanted
                   this way a little.  I went to a doctor
                   and had it fixed.  They made more
                   tests, and they were crazy about my
                   nose -- only they didn't like my acting.

</b>                 Miss Schaefer, I'm trying to do
                 you a favor.  I'm trying to spare
                 you a great deal of misery.  Of
                 course you may be too young to even
                 suspect there are men of his sort...

                            NORMA (Cont'd)
                 I don't know what he's told you, but
                 he does not live with relatives, nor
                 with friends, in the usual sense of
                 the word.  Ask him ... Ask him again.

          During the latter part of her call, the doors from
          Gillis' room have been pushed open and Gillis has
          walked towards her.  Suddenly Norma senses his pre-
          sence and turns around.  The telephone freezes in her
          hand.  She tries to hang it up.  Very calmly Gillis
          takes the receiver from her hand.

          Norma beside him.

<b>                            GILLIS
</b>                 Or maybe it would be a better

          He hangs up.  Norma looks up at him as he crosses to
          the other end of the room and stands staring at her.
          The silence becomes unbearable.

                 needed you.  Look at me.  Look at my
                 hands, look at my face, look under my
                 eyes.  How can I go back to work if I'm
                 wasting away under this torment? You
                 don't know what I've been through these

                 Only, if I'm to work, I need
                 sleep, I need quiet, I need you!
                 Don't just stand there hating
                 me! Shout at me, strike me!

</b>                 Here's ten thousand seventy-nine,

          Betty turns the car into the driveway of Norma's
          place, stops at the entrance steps.  Betty gets out.

<b>                            CONNIE

<b>  E-30    NORMA'S BEDROOM
</b>
          Norma lies on the bed.  Gillis sits in a far corner
          of the room, motionless.

                 I love you, Joe.  I love you, Joe.

          There is the sound of footsteps below and the ringing
          of a doorbell.  Gillis rises.

<b>                            NORMA
</b>                 What are you going to do, Joe?

          Without a word, he leaves the room.  Norma raises
          herself on the bed, reaching for a black negligee
          lying at the foot of it.  As she does so, she dis-
          lodges her pillow a little, revealing a revolver
          hidden beneath it.

          Max crosses the hall, putting on his alpaca jacket.
          He turns on the lights.  Outside stands Betty.
          From the staircase comes -

          Betty enters.  As he leads her into the living room,
          Gillis puts his arm around her shoulders.

<b>                            GILLIS
</b>                 Ever been in one of these old
                 Hollywood palazzos? That's from
                 when they were making eighteen thou-
                 sand a week, and no taxes.  Careful
                 of these tiles, they're slippery.
                 Valentino used to dance here.

          They have reached

          Gillis leads Betty in.

<b>                            GILLIS
</b>                 Hers.

<b>                            BETTY
</b>                 Whose?

<b>                            GILLIS
</b>                 Just look around.  There's a lot
                 of her spread about.  If you don't
                 remember the face, you must have
                 heard the name of Norma Desmond.

<b>                            BETTY
</b>                 That was Norma Desmond on the phone?

<b>                            GILLIS
</b>                 Want something to drink?  There's
                 always champagne on ice, and plenty
                 of caviar.

<b>                            BETTY
</b>                 Why did she call me?

<b>                            GILLIS
</b>                 Jealous.  Ever see so much junk?
                 She had the ceiling brought from
                 Portugal.  Look at this.

          He pulls the rope, showing the projection screen
          under the picture.

<b>                            GILLIS
</b>                 Her own movie theatre.

<b>                            BETTY
</b>                 I didn't come here to see a house.
                 What about Norma Desmond?

<b>                            GILLIS
</b>                 I'm trying to tell you.  This is
                 an enormous place.  Eight master
                 bedrooms.  A sunken tub in every
                 bathroom.  There's a bowling alley
                 in the cellar.  It's lonely here,
                 so she got herself a companion.
                 A very simple set-up: An older
                 woman who is well-to-do.  A younger
                 man who is not doing too well ...
                 Can you figure it out yourself?

<b>                            BETTY
</b>                 No.

<b>                            GILLIS
</b>                 All right.  I'll give you a few
                 more clues.

<b>                            BETTY
</b>                 No, no! I haven't heard any of
                 this.  I never got those telephone
                 calls.  I've never been in this
                 house ... Get your things together.
                 Let's get out of here.

<b>                            GILLIS
</b>                 All my things? All the eighteen
                 suits, all the custom-made shoes and
                 the eighteen dozen shirts, and the
                 cuff-links and the platinum key-
                 chains, and the cigarette cases?

<b>                            BETTY
</b>                 Come on, Joe.

<b>                            GILLIS
</b>                 Come on where? Back to a one-room
                 apartment that I can't pay for?
                 Back to a story that may sell and
                 very possibly will not?

<b>                            BETTY
</b>                 If you love me, Joe.

<b>                            GILLIS
</b>                 Look, sweetie -- be practical.
                 l've got a good thing here.
                 A long-term contract with no options.
                 I like it that way.  Maybe it's not
                 very admirable.  Well, you and Artie
                 can be admirable.

<b>                            BETTY
</b>                 Joe, I can't look at you any more.

<b>                            GILLIS
</b>                 Nobody asked you to.

          Betty turns from him, to hide the fact that she is
          crying.

<b>                            GILLIS
</b>                 All right, baby.  This way out.

          He leads her in the direction of the door.

<b>  E-33    UPPER LANDING, DESMOND HOUSE
</b>
          Sitting crouched behind the balustrade is Norma,
          peering down into


<b>  E-34    THE LOWER HALL
</b>
          Betty and Gillis have reached the entrance door.
          Gillis opens it.

<b>                            GILLIS
</b>                 Good luck to you, Betty.  You can
                 finish that story on the way to
                 Arizona.  When you and Artie get
                 back, if the two of you ever feel
                 like a swim, here's the pool ...

          He switches on the light.


<b>  E-35    THE PATIO
</b>
          The lights go on in the pool, which shines brilliant-
          ly in the dark garden.


<b>  E-36    BETTY
</b>
          She doesn't even look.  Her eyes filled with tears,
          she runs down the entrance porch toward her car.


<b>  E-37    THE ENTRANCE HALL
</b>
          Gillis looks after her, closes the door.  From the
          upper landing comes the sound of soft sobbing.  He
          looks up.


<b>  E-38    NORMA, ON THE UPPER LANDING
</b>
          Gillis ascends the stairs.

<b>                            NORMA
</b>                 Thank you, Joe -- thank you, Joe.

          She tries to take his hand to kiss it as he passes.
          He doesn't stop.  Norma catches his coat.  Gillis
          moves right on into his room.  Norma lies on the
          floor looking after him.  She crawls toward a con-
          sole, pulls herself up by it, starts towards Gillis'
          door, passes a mirror, realizes how she looks, moves
          back to the mirror and takes the patches off her
          face and does a hasty job of removing the cream with
          her handkerchief, readjusts her expression to a poor
          travesty of a smile and goes to the door of Gillis'
          room.

<b>                            NORMA
</b>                 May I come in?  I've stopped cry-

                 tell me you're not cross -- tell
                 me everything is just as it was,
                 Joe.

          She opens the door.


<b>  E-39    GILLIS' ROOM
</b>
          In the foreground, open on the bed, is a half-packed
          suitcase, Gillis just putting some of his old shirts
          in.  Norma stands staring, speechless, for a second.
          Gillis moves out of the shot towards the closets.

<b>                            NORMA
</b>                 What are you doing, Joe?  What

                 me?

<b>                            GILLIS
</b>                 Yes, I am, Norma.

<b>                            NORMA

                      (He gestures in the
                       direction of the closet)
                 Thanks for letting me wear the
                 handsome wardrobe.  And thanks
                 for the use of all the trinkets.

          He takes the cigarette case and throws it on the
          chaise longue.  Then he throws the lighter, the
          wrist watch, the platinum key-chain and the tie clip.

<b>                            GILLIS

<b>                            NORMA
</b>                 It's yours, Joe.  I gave it to

<b>                            GILLIS
</b>                 And I'd take it in a second, Norma --
                 only it's a little too dressy for
                 sitting behind the copy desk in
                 Dayton, Ohio.

<b>                            NORMA

</b>                 Norma, you'd be throwing it away.

          links Norma gave him, takes them off.

          Norma reappears in the door, carrying the revolver.

          There is the SOUND OF A SHOT.  The glass of the front
          door is shattered.  Gillis at the door opens it and
          walks out, without looking back.

          Down the staircase rushes Norma.  a disordered wild-
          ness in the way she moves.

          Dark except for lights from the house and the
          luminousness of the lit pool.

          Gillis is crossing the patio towards the garage.  He
          is carrying the typewriter.  He doesn't accelerate
          his step, although he has heard the shot.  Behind
          him Norma comes from the lighted house.

<b>                             NORMA
</b>                   You're not leaving me!

          She shoots twice in rapid succession.  Gillis drops
          the typewriter.  The shots have swung him around.  He
          is now facing Norma.  She shoots him.  This shot
          hits him in the belly.  He doubles up, instinctively
          backs away from her, plummets into the lit pool.

          Up the stone steps from the garage rushes Max.
          He sees the situation, hurries towards Norma, who
          stands exultant in the strange light from the pool.

          A lietuenant from the Homicide Bureau leaves the

                 I'm too happy.  Do you mind,
                 Mr. DeMille, if I say a few words?
                 Thank you.  I just want to tell
                 you how happy I am to be back in
                 the studio making a picture again.
                 You don't know how much I've missed
                 all of you.  And I promise you
                 I'll never desert you again, because
                 after "Salome" we'll make another
                 picture, and another and another.
                 You see, this is my life.  It always
                 will be.  There's nothing else -
                 just us and the cameras and those
                 wonderful people out there in the
                 dark...  All right, Mr. DeMille,
                 I'm ready for my closeup.

<b>          FADE OUT.
</b>
<b>                         THE END
</b>
