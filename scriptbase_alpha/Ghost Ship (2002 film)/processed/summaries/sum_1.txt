When Canadian Air Force pilot Jack Ferriman recruits the team to investigate a mysterious vessel he has spotted floating adrift off the coast of Alaska in a remote region of the Bering Sea, they discover the remains of the fabled Antonia Graza, thought lost at sea for more than 40 years.
It's a hell of a find.
The salvage rights alone could be worth a fortune.
And by the law of the sea, any abandoned vessel discovered on international waters can be claimed by whomever is fortunate enough to find her and skilled enough to haul her back to port.
But once on board the eerie, cavernous ship, the crew of the Arctic Warrior discovers that the decaying vessel is anything but deserted.
It's home to something more deadly and horrific than anything they've encountered in all their years at sea.
