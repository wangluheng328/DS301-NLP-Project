</b>
<b>							 FADE IN
</b>
<b>	INT. BARGE - DAY
</b>
	Crewman EPPS (29), wearing a life vest and tool belt, jumps 
	down into the darkness. She stands in a great hollow cavern, 
	oily, wet, resonant with the sound of creaking, rusty steel 
	and WATER MOVING OVER ITS HULL on the other side.

<b>	INT. BARGE - LATER - DAY
</b>
	Epps comes to a low point in the darkness, shining her light 
	on a lake of salt water sloshing against the bulkhead. She 
	kneels. As the water sloshes back she sees that it is leaking 
	in through the seams in the steel plate of the hull.

<b>	EXT. BARGE - LATER - DAY
</b>
	Epps pulls herself onto the deck from below. She stands on a 
	rusting 5000 ton tank barge being pulled in the open ocean 
	by a brawny marine tug at the end of a 150 foot tow cable. 
	It is a typical summer day in the southern Bering Sea, which 
	means a healthy chop and a stiff cold breeze out of the north-
	west.  She closes the hatch behind her and makes her way 
	forward.

<b>	EXT. BARGE - BOW - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
</b>
	Up ahead, the tug pulls steadily, grey-black clouds of diesel 
	smoke rising from its massive turbine vents.

	Epps cinches and checks her body harness, focused and 
	professional. The product of a rocky childhood in the Pacific 
	Northwest and a few years of hard living, she's found her 
	true calling now. And under some grime, several polypro shirts 
	and a pair of orange men's Insulite pants she might even be 
	considered pretty.

	She clips her harness into the tow cable where it attaches 
	to a heavy pair of eye cleats at the bow. She climbs onto 
	the cable, hanging out over the water as it breaks on the 
	bow beneath her. She pulls herself forward on a roller bearing 
	that fits over the width of the cable and starts off toward 
	the tug at the other end.

<b>	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - LATER - DAY
</b>
	DODGE and GREER look on from the stern, where the boat's 
	name "Arctic Warrior" is emblazoned on the transom. Dodge 
	(37), scruffy chief engineer, wearing de rigueur greasy 
	coveralls and nicotine stained fingers, is an expatriate 
	Texan and former merchant marine. GREER (42), is the boat's 
	first mate, African American, originally from some sweltering 
	red-neck hellhole, now a tug pilot intentionally well to the 
	north.

	They watch as Epps pulls herself toward them, the cable 
	occasionally dipping a few feet with a spray of water as a 
	passing swell slackens it. Epps pulls herself to the stern 
	where the cable winds into a tow anchor.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		It's a slow leak.

	She unclips and drops to the deck.

<b>				GREER
</b>		What's slow?

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Maybe twenty gallons an hour.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		Where from?

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Amidships starboard at the beam.  
		Just under the waterline. I don't 
		think it's a problem.

<b>				GREER
</b>		Hear that, Dodge? Epps don't think 
		it's a problem.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		I'll sleep good tonight knowing that.

<b>	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
	The view from the pilothouse commands 360 degrees as radar 
	and GPS navigation displays glow. MURPHY, the ship's master, 
	pilots the boat. He is 48, at sea all his adult life, and 
	most of the rest, a fact written on his face and one that 
	every crewman who's ever worked for him has been willing to 
	bet his life on. A walkie-talkie CRACKLES AWAKE.

<b>				GREER (V.O. RADIO)
</b>		Greer to Murphy.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>			(lifting the radio)
		Go.

	Murphy turns back to see Greer, Epps, and Dodge looking up 
	at him from the stern.

<b>				GREER
</b>		The number nine on the starboard 
		side's half flooded. Epps says it's 
		a slow leak just under the waterline, 
		about twenty gallons an hour. They 
		must've pumped it before we left 
		Sitka.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Of course they did.

<b>				GREER
</b>		Let the buyer beware.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		What do you say, Dodge?

<b>				DODGE (V.O. RADIO)
</b>			(taking the radio)
		If it started out at twenty an hour 
		the piece of shit'd be at the bottom 
		of the Gulf by now. Whether it'll 
		make St. Lawrence is anybody's guess.

<b>	EXT. OPEN OCEAN - DAY
</b>
	HIGH AND WIDE as the Arctic Warrior pulls the barge against 
	the swell of a grey ocean and a darkening sky.

<b>						 DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>	EXT. PORT GERMAINE - ST. LAWRENCE ISLAND - DAY
</b>
	The shores of St. Lawrence Island open into a small port 
	town of mainly pre-fab buildings as the Arctic Warrior 
	approaches with the barge, now pathetically listing to one 
	side as it moves into the harbor.

<b>	EXT. PORT GERMAINE - DOCKS - LATER - DAY
</b>
	A smaller harbor tug helps the Arctic Warrior jockey the 
	listing barge to the dock as Epps and Dodge jump off to tie 
	her up.

<b>	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
</b>
	Greer feathers the tug into position and shuts down the 
	turbines.

<b>	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
	Murphy jumps down from the pilothouse to the deck as a fat 
	Russian man, Vasili (60) and a MECHANIC in grease-covered 
	orange coveralls approach from the dock.

<b>				VASILI
</b>		I thought you say Tuesday.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Better late than never.

<b>				VASILI
</b>			(seeing the listing 
			barge)
		What's this?

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		You got a leak in the number nine 
		compartment.

<b>				VASILI
</b>		No, no. You got leak.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		You pump it out and re-seam the hull, 
		she'll be good as new.

<b>				VASILI
</b>		That cost me twenty grand at least.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Fifteen, at the most.

<b>				VASILI
</b>		Twenty. You knock off twenty and 
		then we see. After my guy looks at 
		it.

<b>	INT. VASILI'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
	In a prefab office with a view of the shipyard, Vasili cuts 
	a check as Murphy and Greer look on. He tears it out of the 
	book, handing it across the desk to Murphy, who inspects it.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		You're kidding, right?

<b>				VASILI
</b>		You want fair pay, make hamburger 
		for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to 
		sign.

	Vasili pushes a transfer register toward him. Murphy signs.

<b>	EXT. SHIPYARD - DAY
</b>
	Greer and Murphy walk back toward the dock.

<b>				GREER
</b>		Not bad for dragging a leaky tub 
		half way to Russia.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		He'll sell the scrap for three times 
		what he paid.

<b>				GREER
</b>		I must be in the wrong business.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		You got that right.

<b>				GREER
</b>			(imitating Vasili)
		Better than "making hamburger for 
		Mickey D."

<b>	INT. BAR - NIGHT
</b>
	A typical port town bar. Except this one is on an island in 
	the middle of the Bering Sea. Epps lines up a shot at the 
	pool table as a couple of SEAMEN check out her ass and a 
	tattoo of Wiley Coyote poking out of her pants. Greer reads 
	a paper near-by.

	Murphy enters, crossing to the bar where Dodge nurses a beer 
	and a cigarette. Murphy throws down an envelope with Dodge's 
	name on it. Dodge picks it up, thumbs through a thick stack 
	of hundreds.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		Much obliged, skipper.

<b>	INT. BAR - LATER - NIGHT
</b>
	The place is a little more crowded now as Epps pushes her 
	way through to the bar, a cigarette dangling from her mouth. 
	She buys two beers and pays the BARTENDER from her envelope 
	of cash. She takes the beers back to the far wall where a 
	young off-duty COASTGUARDSMAN stands. He takes one, they 
	laugh.

<b>	AT A TABLE
</b>
	Beers, cigarettes and pay envelopes on the table before them, 
	Dodge, Greer and Murphy look on at Epps across the room, who 
	is showing the coastguardsman a birthmark on her neck.

<b>				GREER
</b>		Looks like Epps' gonna get some 
		tonight.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		With that coxswain dickhead.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?

<b>				DODGE
</b>		Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps?  
		Gimme a break.

	Greer and Murphy trade looks as Dodge raises his beer.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		What a laugh.

	A MINOR COMMOTION can be heard as they sit there.

<b>				WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>		I'll show you, bitch!

	They look over to see the coastguardsman's GIRLFRIEND, late 
	20s, hefty in a red miniskirt and big hair.

<b>				GIRLFRIEND
</b>		You want to mess with me, I'll kick 
		your bitch ass, girl.

<b>	WITH EPPS
</b>
	Epps coolly puts out her cigarette as a circle has gathered 
	around her and the girlfriend, anxious to see a girl fight.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		I don't know what you're talking 
		about. I just bought this guy a beer.

<b>				GIRLFRIEND
</b>		This "guy" is my man, honey.

<b>				COASTGUARDSMAN
</b>		Darlene --

<b>				GIRLFRIEND
</b>		You, shut up.

<b>				EPPS
</b>			(starting off)
		Listen, I don't want any trouble, 
		okay -- ?

<b>				GIRLFRIEND
</b>			(stopping Epps)
		Uh-uh. No. We're gonna fix this right 
		now.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>			(stepping up)
		What seems to be the trouble, ladies?

<b>				RIVETER
</b>		Whyn't you mind your own business, 
		chief.

	Murphy turns to see a shipyard RIVETER, a big man holding a 
	beer, still wearing his welding leathers. Murphy turns back 
	to Epps and the Girlfriend.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		As I said, what seems to be the 
		trouble?

<b>				RIVETER
</b>		Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you 
		got your hearing aid turned down?

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		I heard you. But I'm choosing to 
		ignore you. Epps, let's go.

	Epps starts forward but the Riveter stands in her way, taking 
	Murphy by the collar.

<b>				RIVETER
</b>		These ladies was having themselves a 
		discussion and you're interrupting 
		it.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		You got about two seconds to get 
		your paws off me, Tarzan.

<b>				RIVETER
</b>		Or what?

	Or WHACK! Murphy can't help but wince as a pool cue breaks 
	in two over the Riveter's head.

	Dodge, cigarette in his mouth, takes a look at the cue half 
	he still holds, shaking his head.

	The Riveter's hands fall from Murphy's collar and his legs 
	buckle. Some of his BUDDIES hold him up as Greer reminds 
	some of the others he's holding a pool cue of his own.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Epps?

	He looks to Epps like let's get the hell out of here. She 
	grabs her coat.

<b>				COASTGUARDSMAN
</b>		Wait.

	Epps holds there as the Coastguardsman steps up to his 
	girlfriend.

<b>				COASTGUARDSMAN
</b>		Darlene. It's over.

	He gives her the ring from his finger. Murphy rolls his eyes 
	as the others look on.

<b>				COASTGUARDSMAN
</b>		I don't love you anymore.

	Darlene breaks into tears as they all look on, some pat her 
	on the back.

<b>				COASTGUARDSMAN
</b>			(to Epps)
		Come on, Candy. Let's get out of 
		here.

	The Coastguardsman takes her by the hand. Epps looks to Murphy 
	and the others as he leads her out.

<b>	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY
</b>
	Murphy, Greer, and Dodge ready the tug to leave as Epps 
	approaches on the dock. She jumps down onto the deck, a spring 
	in her step and a song in her heart.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Morning everybody.

<b>				GREER
</b>		Show your tatoos to that coxswain 
		last night, did you Epps?

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Showed him a hell of a lot more than 
		that.

<b>				GREER
</b>		I bet you did.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Candy?

<b>				EPPS
</b>		It's my pen name.

<b>	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - DAY
</b>
	Murphy throttles up the turbines and backs the tug away from 
	the dock as Greer studies the dawn sky.

<b>				GREER
</b>		Red sky at night, sailor's delight.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Red sky in morning, sailor take 
		warning.

<b>	EXT. PORT GERMAINE - DOCKS - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
	As the tug turns into the harbor channel, the sun rising 
	under a cloud bank of brilliant red and orange.

<b>						 DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT
</b>
	Dodge and Epps play cards at the galley table.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		Fuck it.

	He puts down his hand. Epps takes another drag from her 
	cigarette, collecting her winnings.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		One more?

<b>				DODGE
</b>		Why not.

	She gathers the cards, shuffles.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		What is your first name?

<b>				EPPS
</b>		What?

<b>				DODGE
</b>		It just occurred to me I don't know 
		your first name. All this time and I 
		don't know it.

	She deals the cards in silence.

<b>				EPPS
</b>			(finally)
		Maureen.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		What?

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Maureen.

	Through the pilothouse windows, the hull of the Chimera

	Murphy sits at the chart table as Epps steps in.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Coffee?

<b>				MURPHY
</b>			(sitting up)
		Yeah. Thanks.

	She brings him his cup, seeing the documents he brought back 
	from the Chimera.

<b>				EPPS
</b>			(taking a seat)
		What'd you find up there?

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Some charts. A crew manifest.
			(looking them over)
		Looks like her last voyage was January 
		1953. The question is where the hell's 
		she been since.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		She was sailing up north, right?

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Her destination was Halifax, yeah.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Well, suppose she got a little further 
		north than she should have.  Got 
		stuck in the ice. The passengers and 
		crew evacuated. She froze into the 
		ice pack, which moved further north, 
		where it froze in solid. They write 
		it off. Fifty years later, the whole 
		global warming thing happens. The 
		ice melts, she gets loose and floats 
		around til somebody runs into her.

	Murphy nods, considering it.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		As reasonable an explanation as any, 
		I guess.

	Epps takes a sip of her coffee as she thinks about it.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Nope.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		She was a two-masted brig boat sailing 
		out of New York in 1872.  One day 
		she was sighted off the coast of 
		Portugal by a merchant vessel, the 
		Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei 
		Gratia got closer, they discovered 
		that no one was at the helm of the 
		Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found 
		her completely deserted. The captain, 
		his wife, their daughter, and the 
		entire crew, all gone. The last entry 
		in their log made no mention of any 
		trouble. The table was even set for 
		dinner. And in the nine days after 
		the last entry, she sailed 700 miles 
		without anyone aboard.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		So what did happen?

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Nobody knows. There've been a lot of 
		theories, of course. But we'll never 
		really know for sure.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		You think she's sailing without a 
		crew?

	Murphy looks out at the Chimera off the bow.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		I think we'd be surprised where a 
		drifting ship might wind up with a 
		little wind and the right current.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		You're more practical than 
		superstitious.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Only way to be.

	Epps nods, takes another sip of coffee, looking on at the 
	rusting hull of the Chimera stretching off in the light.

	Dodge gives him the thumbs up as it comes down easily.

<b>				MURPHY

<b>				DODGE
</b>		Turbine rotor's shot.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		I thought you said it was just a 
		blade.

<b>				DODGE

<b>				DODGE
</b>		The right way and the wrong way.

</b>		I'm telling you, you don't want to 
		be running that fan like it is.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		What about running number two by 
		itself?

<b>				DODGE
</b>		It's a full 2500 horses down. We 
		couldn't drag that boat down hill on 
		ice with it.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		How long, then?

<b>				DODGE
</b>		I gotta pull the blades and re-seat 
		everything in a new rotor -- .

	Epps steps from a passageway into a large public room. Tables 
	and chairs are scattered haphazardly, light falling in from 
	windows along the wall where tattered curtains hang. She 
	walks on.

	A pair of empty glasses sit on a table, an empty sherry 
	decanter beside them. An ashtray sits beside that. Epps stops, 
	reaching down. She pulls back a half-smoked cigarette, 
	lipstick smudging the end, yellowing and fragile from time.  
	And, as she stands there, we see a FIGURE, IN MURKY 
	SILHOUETTE, MOVE PAST THE DOORWAY IN THE BACKGROUND. In an 
	instant it is there and gone.

	She puts down the cigarette, having sensed a presence. She 
	turns to the doorway across the room, but there is nothing 
	to be seen now.

	TICKING CLOCK sounds from here. She turns, putting down the 
	doll, holding a beat. She approaches, crossing the room, 
	coming finally to a stop before us and what we come to see 
	is an ancient grandfather clock.

	All but it's minute hand has fallen off its corroded face, 
	but from inside it emits a weak though steady TICKING.

	Epps stands there as the clock ticks, looking on, when the

	her, now silent.

	Epps jumps down to a lower deck. She shines her light up to 
	see that she is in an engine compartment, showing a massive

	where the giant pistons of the ship's power plant rise up to 
	the ceiling.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - SUB-DECK - PASSAGE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps moves, passing still more diesel burners, towering over 
	her in the cavernous space. She moves into a narrowing 
	passage, piping and machinery ducts winding their way into 
	the depths of the ship.

	Finally the passage opens into yet another compartment, 
	apparently a cargo hold. Crates and boxes are stacked on 
	loading palettes.

	In the corner, a rotting canvas drape covers something. Epps 
	comes to it. She lifts the canvas, which crumbles away to 
	reveal a 1951 Ferrari sportster. For the exception of a coat 
	of dust and a small amount of corrosion, it is perfectly 
	preserved.

	Mail bags lie in piles along the wall, stacked between more 
	wooden crates and palettes, when something catches Epps' 
	eye.

	A heavy, metal door in the wall is twisted on it's hinges, 
	as though blown back from some terrific explosive force.

	Epps approaches, coming to the twisted door. She shines her 
	light inside.

	A clutter of debris, shelving and wood, are visible in the 
	shadows, when her light catches a glint of something. She 
	swings her light back, revealing a yellowish bright object 
	between broken wood slats.

	Epps steps in. She kneels, shining the light closer. The 
	yellow glint is metal. Epps pulls back a slat, sliding away 
	some of the debris to reveal that it is cast from a kilogram 
	ingot of gold.

	She reaches out. She raises it, completely untouched by the 
	years. She pulls back still more debris, revealing a stack 
	of gold ingots, some having tumbled to the side. She slides 
	away a large trunk that has fallen, pushing off more junk to 
	see that the stack is much larger, perhaps four feet high 
	and five feet across.

	A beat as Epps stands there, looking on at $50,000,000 in 
	gold.

	Murphy has stepped forward, taking an ingot, inspecting it.

<b>				GREER
</b>		How much you figure that's worth, 
		skipper?

<b>				MURPHY
</b>			(still looking it 
			over)
		Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty 
		million.

<b>				GREER
</b>		Ho, baby!

<b>				EPPS
</b>		That's a lot of money for somebody 
		to just let float away.

	Murphy looks up at her from the gold.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Yes, it is.

	A beat as they all hold there.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		It's a hell of a lot of money.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		What, you think there's something 
		funny about it?

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		A ship with fifty million dollars in 
		gold aboard, adrift? And nobody seems 
		to care enough to come looking for 
		it?

<b>				GREER
</b>		If they thought it was lost at sea, 
		they probably just wrote it off.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Not for fifty million. An ocean liner 
		maybe. But fifty million in gold, 
		they come looking for.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Maybe they didn't want it back.  
		Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Maybe. But there's always somebody 
		whose interest's at stake.

<b>				GREER
</b>		All I gotta say is it looks like 
		that somebody's us right now.

	Greer cackles as he high fives Dodge.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		And it looks like somebody got here 
		before us too.

	The steel hatch is twisted, as from a great hand ripping it 
	back from the wall.

<b>				DODGE
</b>			(inspecting it)
		Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell 
		you that. Torn parts rusted bad as 
		the rest of the boat.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		So what're we gonna do. That's the 
		big question, right?

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's 
		as valid as a claim to the vessel 
		itself. It's ours.

</b>		Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy 
		stinking rich.

</b>		So what? We gonna unload the gold 
		and get a move on?

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		We leave it where it is. Stick to 
		the plan.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		You gotta be kidding? What the hell 
		we need that tub for, we got fifty

</b>		So we get a little more for the boat. 
		Besides, the gold'll be safer where

	Murphy enters to find the engine room engulfed in flames and 
	black smoke. He finds Dodge spraying at it with an 
	extinguisher of his own.

	The flames belch up from an oil fire in the turbine well, 
	the heat searing paint on the metal covers. Murphy sprays a 
	cloud of halon and the fire dims, but only for a moment.

	Dodge grabs another extinguisher, his leg burned, face and 
	hands singed.

	An EXPLOSION ROCKS THE BOAT and molten flames hurl through 
	the air, catching Murphy's pant leg. He's so engrossed in 
	fighting the flames, he doesn't realize he's on fire.

<b>				DODGE

		Murphy!

	Murphy looks down to see his pant leg is on fire, as Dodge 
	turns a cloud of halon on him, putting it out.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		Propane tanks're gonna go!

	Murphy crosses in the smoke, coming as close as he dares to 
	the most intense part of the flames. He turns the extinguisher 
	into them, holding it there.

	The flames dim, as Dodge joins him on the other side, turning 
	his extinguisher on it too. The fire seems to dim yet again 
	as clouds of halon rise up.

	Fire belches from a duct, crawling across the ceiling. Dodge 
	fires his extinguisher at it, pushing it back across to the 
	wall again.

	Murphy extinguishes the last of the flames in the turbine 
	well as Dodge brings a snaking tendril of fire down to the 
	deck, and finally out.

	Dodge pours out a few cans of cold chili into a bowl and 
	takes it to the table where Epps, Greer, and Murphy sit under 
	the stark light of a gas lantern.

<b>				GREER
</b>		Fifty million four ways. That's twelve 
		million and change a piece.  What 
		you gonna do with your share, skipper?

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Not much at all, I guess. Retire.

<b>				GREER
</b>		Moving to Sweden.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		What's so great about Sweden?

<b>				GREER
</b>		It's a beautiful country. Very clean. 
		Very civilized. And cold.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		That's a good thing?

<b>				GREER
</b>		Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder

<b>				DODGE
</b>		Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish

</b>		Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be

</b>		Yeah, yeah.

<b>	A STRANGE SOUND BEGINS. IT IS LIKE A DISTANT SHRIEKING, AS 
</b><b>	OF METAL AGAINST METAL, BUT ALMOST HUMAN, DISTANTLY ECHOING.
</b>
<b>				GREER
</b>		What the hell is that?

	The SHRIEKING CONTINUES, ECHOING EERILY AS IF FROM THE SEA.

<b>	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
</b>
	Dodge, Epps, Murphy and Greer emerge on deck.

	The DISTANT SHRIEKING IS LOUDER HERE, BUT SEEMS TO BE 
	EMANATING FROM DEEP IN THE SHIP as they stand facing it on 
	the bow.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		It's coming from inside.

	They hold there listening as the SHRIEKING CONTINUES.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		Sounds like the hull.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Warm water current maybe, making the 
		metal expand.

<b>				GREER
</b>		That shit is seriously bizarre.

	The DISTANT SHRIEKING ECHO continues as they hold there.

<b>	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY
</b>
	The engine room is black with soot, the turbines covered in 
	halon powder. Dodge stands there looking at it. He sighs.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - DAY
</b>
	Greer goes through shelves of supplies, finding a stack of 
	sterno cans and warming candles. He throws them into a wooden 
	crate of other supplies he's gathered.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - FIRST CLASS STATEROOM - DAY
</b>
	Epps slowly pushes open the door. She holds a sack with a 
	few items she's managed to scavenge. Light falls from 
	curtained windows onto the room. A divan sits against the 
	wall. A table stands in the middle of the room, a moth-eaten 
	velvet table cloth sitting under a brass lamp on top. Two 
	twin beds stand on either side. They are covered in dust and 
	are moth-eaten, unmade, as if the occupants had just gotten 
	up, fifty years ago.

	In one corner is an armoire. Epps steps up to it, pulling 
	back the door to reveal a rack of woman's clothing hanging 
	there undisturbed.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
</b>
	A pair of slippers lie on the floor beside a chair, over 
	which is draped a woman's robe. Epps lifts it, the material 
	crumbling in her hands.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
</b>
	A drawer comes back to reveal a number of personal affects, 
	a man's billfold, cuff links, tarnished silver cigarette 
	holder and case, coins, black horn-rimmed glasses, pocket 
	watch and fob, and a room key.

	Epps pulls back the billfold. She opens it. Inside she finds 
	a Canadian passport a picture of a dark-haired man with a 
	mustache and black horn-rimmed glasses, circa 1950. In the 
	folds she finds three hundred Canadian dollars. An insert 
	holds pictures, of a suburban home, children, and a woman, 
	presumably his wife.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - "A" DECK PASSAGE - LATER - DAY
</b>
	Epps steps from the room. She turns to close the door, but 
	stops, holding there, strongly sensing something.

	THE CAMERA SLOWLY COMES AROUND TO HER OTHER SIDE, revealing 
	the long passageway behind her, each bulkhead hatchway 
	creating the impression of a tunnel of mirrors that frame 
	one another and, standing at the very end of this tunnel in 
	the foggy light from a porthole, a MAN in dark clothing.

	Epps slowly turns her head to see what she already senses, 
	the man standing at the end of the passageway facing her. A 
	beat as they hold there. The man only stares back at her, 
	then turns to walk away.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Hey!

	Epps moves off as the man walks around the corner.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Hey, wait a minute! Hey!

	MOVING WITH Epps as she breaks into a run, going down the 
	passageway. She comes to the corner, rounding it out onto 
	another passageway. The man is nowhere to be seen.

	Epps moves quickly down the passageway, coming to the next 
	corner, rounding it out to see only another long passageway.  
	She turns back, running right into Murphy.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Take it easy, you'll live longer.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Did you see him?

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Who?

<b>				EPPS
</b>		The guy. He just came this way.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		What guy?

<b>				EPPS
</b>		There's somebody else on this boat.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		What? What the hell're you talking 
		about.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some 
		guy.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Are you sure?

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Of course I'm sure. I saw him.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		You sure it wasn't me?

<b>				EPPS
</b>		It wasn't you. It was somebody else. 
		There's somebody else aboard.

	A beat as Murphy looks back at her.

<b>	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
	Greer, Dodge, Murphy, and Epps stand around by lantern light.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		Light in those passages ain't so 
		good.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I 
		don't know who it was. But I saw 
		somebody.

<b>				GREER
</b>		What'd he look like?

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get 
		a good look. He was far away. But I 
		saw him. I saw him as sure as you're 
		standing there.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		Where's his boat, then? Where's his 
		crew? He ain't gonna be out here by 
		himself, that's for damn sure.

<b>				GREER
</b>		She's so big somebody could come 
		alongside her on the other side and 
		we'd never know it.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Maybe that is his boat.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		Gimme a break.

	A beat as they sit in silence.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		If somebody's aboard her already, 
		she ain't ours. She's theirs.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam 
		for fifty years. We found her. She's 
		ours.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Not in the eyes of the law.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		So, we find this guy and make a deal 
		with him.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		We don't exactly have the best 
		bargaining position.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a 
		professional salvage crew going about 
		our business. What's some yahoo doing 
		way out here by himself anyway?

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		And what do you propose? That we 
		knock this guy off?

<b>				DODGE
</b>		Why not? Why the fuck not?

	A beat as Murphy, Greer and Epps exchange looks.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. 
		We gonna let this guy just take it 
		from us? One guy?

<b>				EPPS
</b>		So we kill him?

<b>				DODGE
</b>		I'm saying we gotta do whatever we 
		gotta do to preserve our interest.

<b>				GREER
</b>		I don't know.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Let's just take it easy here, alright? 
		Nobody's gonna kill anybody.

<b>				GREER
</b>		Supposing he wants to get bad with 
		us?

<b>				DODGE
</b>		One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Maybe he isn't alone.

	They consider this a moment.

<b>				GREER
</b>		I say we off-load some of that gold 
		now.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Would you hold on just a minute here, 
		please? Look, there's no reason to 
		panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine. 
		It's a big boat.  Chances're real 
		good he doesn't even know about the 
		gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be 
		the wiser.
			(a beat)
		The gold stays where it is til we're 
		ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a 
		hell of a lot safer there than here.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		What if that fucker finds it before 
		we're ready to go?

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight 
		off. Low man first.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Guess that'd be me. Again.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Dodge, get on that turbine. I don't 
		care if you don't sleep for a week.  
		The sooner you're done, the sooner 
		we can get out of here. How's the 
		food situation?

<b>				GREER
</b>		Pretty low all around.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		We'll have to take it easy then. I 
		don't think we'll find much aboard 
		the ship, but it's probably worth 
		looking around.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Say we run into this guy again.

	A beat as they consider this.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		If he's reasonable, maybe we can 
		make some kind of deal. If not.  
		We'll have to re-consider our options.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit 
		up.

<b>	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - WARD LOCKER - NIGHT
</b>
	Epps is dressed in her cold weather gear as she opens a 
	locker, revealing a flare gun and a shotgun. Epps pulls back 
	the shotgun and a box of shells.

<b>	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - NIGHT
</b>
	Murphy and Dodge look on as Epps loads the last of several 
	shotgun shells into the pump action short barrel 12-gauge.  
	She expertly shuttles a round into the chamber with one hand.  
	Dodge takes a hit from his cigarette as Greer crosses from 
	the deck house.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		Pretty handy with that scatter gun, 
		Epps. You raised on a farm?

<b>				EPPS
</b>			(setting the safety)
		Seen a lota movies.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		No cowboy shit up there, understand?

<b>				EPPS
</b>		No cowboy shit. Right.

	Greer extends a thermos to Epps.

<b>				GREER
</b>		Coffee.

<b>				EPPS
</b>			(pocketing it in her 
			coat)
		You're a pal.

	She checks the squelch on her radio, pockets it too.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Got your light?

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Yup.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		Smokes?

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Oh yeah.

	Her bravado does little to hide her apprehension as she slings 
	the shotgun on her back.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		See you boys later.
			(to Greer)
		Don't be late, I need my beauty rest.

	She looks up, climbs onto the crane and up toward the darkened 
	ship above them.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT
</b>
	A flashlight beam cuts through the darkness as Epps 
	approaches. If this place is creepy in the daylight, it is 
	terrifying now. She comes to a ladder and climbs down.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT
</b>
	Epps shines her light as she passes through, coming to the 
	cargo hold. She crosses in the darkness, her light catching 
	the tarnished glint of the gold. She comes up to it, stopping 
	there, looking on at it, a perfectly symmetrical fortune.

	She looks around for a place to sit. She drags a palette to 
	the bulkhead, settling in to face the rest of the compartment. 
	She puts her shotgun down beside her and takes out her thermos 
	to pour herself a cup of coffee.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT
</b>
	Epps has dozed off when a CLATTERING ECHOES DISTANTLY 
	somewhere in the ship. Epps wakes. It is silent, as she holds 
	there, not sure she heard anything, when a DISTANT BOOMING 
	SOUNDS. She reaches out for the shotgun, intently listening.

	As Epps holds there, another deep BOOMING sounds distantly 
	somewhere. Epps turns, her blood running cold.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
</b>
	Epps moves along in the darkness when the DISTANT BOOMING 
	CAN BE HEARD BRIEFLY AGAIN. She stops, holding there, in the 
	silence.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - SHAFT ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
</b>
	Epps jumps down into the shaft alley where the ship's massive 
	propeller shaft hangs suspended above her. Epps moves along.  
	Finally she comes out into...

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
</b>
	Where the propeller shaft extends into a large turbine. She 
	continues on, past huge rusting diesel burners, disappearing 
	into the darkness above her, when ANOTHER BOOM SOUNDS.

	She turns, shinning her light back from where she came.  
	Nothing moves. Not a sound, but for her breathing and maybe 
	her heart pounding in her chest. ANOTHER BOOM SOUNDS, again 
	echoing distantly in the silence. She shines her light through 
	the line of burners. Nothing moves.

	Epps moves quietly between the burners. She comes to a massive 
	watertight door at the bulkhead. She steps through, finding 
	herself standing between a row of huge oil storage tanks. 
	THE BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN, closer, as suddenly stopping.

	She moves on, cautiously walking between the tanks, holding 
	her light out before her. She comes to the end of the 
	compartment and another bulkhead. The BOOMING SOUNDS, still 
	closer. She turns the light into the recesses, showing rusting 
	machinery and a stack of oil drums.

	She approaches, holding the shotgun up. As she nears, the 
	BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN. She stops. It is coming from here.

	She tenses, raising the shotgun, holding the light as steady 
	as she can manage. The BOOMING SOUNDS YET AGAIN. It is 
	metallic and staccato.

	She stops in the corner beside an oil drum. Several drums 
	have toppled and lie scattered in a pile when a draft stirs 
	her hair. She shines her light up to see that she stands at 
	the bottom of a giant hatchway shaft rising all the way 
	through the ship to the top deck and an echoey breeze that 
	betrays a throughway to the outside.

	The BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN, this time coming from the pile of 
	oil drums. She steps closer, raising the shotgun, ready to 
	fire. A beat as she summons her courage, then reaches out to 
	push a drum with her foot, when A BLUR EXPLODES OUT AT HER.  
	She fires the shotgun and a spray of buckshot glances off 
	the steel bulkhead in a shower of sparks, a flurry of frenetic 
	flapping whizzing by her head as she looks up to see a large 
	albatross flying back up the hatchway shaft toward the top 
	of the ship and freedom.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Murphy to Epps.

	She settles back, exhausted.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Murphy to Epps.

<b>				EPPS
</b>			(taking her radio)
		Epps.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		You just shoot at something?

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid 
		bird.

	She wipes her brow on her sleeve, holding there a moment, 
	when she smells something really awful.

	She steps forward, following the smell, pushing aside the 
	toppled oil drums to see an unidentifiable form in the beam 
	of her flashlight. She steps still closer, training her light 
	on the form to see that it is a human torso.  A large gash 
	runs up its middle and the clothing has been torn by 
	scavenging birds.

	She hesitates, then steps still closer when she steps on 
	something. She starts, then shines the light on the deck in 
	front of her where the body's decaying head looks back with 
	wide, unseeing eyes.

	It takes everything she has just to hold there. She shines 
	her light back to the headless torso.

	She shines her light beyond that, and up, to reveal a bent 
	steam pipe hanging out over the deck, stained with dried 
	blood, a pair of legs dangling from the pipe when, just behind 
	her, a booted foot comes into frame, lightly touching her.

	She spins around to see another body above her. Except this 
	one hangs in one piece, suspended from another bent steam 
	pipe. It has been impaled length-wise on the pipe from rectum 
	to mouth.

	One of its arms has rotted off and lies on the deck below 
	it.  A few feet away, a third body hangs impaled from another 
	bent pipe.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - ENGINE ROOM - LATER - NIGHT
</b>
	A lantern illuminates the impaled bodies and their various 
	rotting parts.

<b>				GREER (O.S.)
</b>		Ho-ly shit.

<b>				MURPHY (O.S.)
</b>		Couldn't have happened much more 
		than a month ago.

	Greer, Dodge, and Epps look on as Murphy kneels over the 
	remains of the headless torso.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Bodies're too fresh.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		Fresh ain't the first word that comes 
		to mind.

	Murphy checks the pockets, finding a wallet. He looks through 
	it.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Greek citizen. Merchant navy.
			(standing)
		Obviously we aren't the first to 
		come across this ship. They probably 
		stumbled across it just like we did.

<b>				GREER
</b>		And look what happened.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		Damn barbaric is what it is.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Could be meant as a warning.

<b>				GREER
</b>		Stay away. Or else.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Because of the gold.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		That'd be my guess.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		So whoever did this might still be 
		around.

<b>				GREER
</b>		Maybe Epps's mystery man had something 
		to do with it.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Maybe.

	A beat as they consider the implications of this.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		So, what? We report this? Call the 
		Coastguard?

	Another beat as they hold there.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		Let's not be too hasty.

<b>				GREER
</b>		Yeah. Hell, what difference does it 
		make if we report it now or later?  
		We call this in now, gonna be 
		Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all 
		over the place.

	A beat as nobody's too sure about this.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Dodge, if this isn't incentive enough 
		to fix that boat, I don't know what 
		is.

		Anything that was rubber burned up.

	Murphy stands at the doorway, looking on.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Can't you use something else?

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
	Murphy stands in the cramped room, full of radios and 
	communications equipment. He looks through the shelves and 
	cabinets, when he opens a drawer to find a dusty bound book.  
	He pulls it back, opening it to see that it is a radio call 
	log. He takes a seat, paging through it.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - WITH GREER - LATER - DAY
</b>
	Greer works to disassemble a compressor mechanism. He has 
	difficulty getting the right purchase with his wrench, when 
	he slips.

<b>				GREER
</b>		Dammit!

	A beat as he inspects his hand. In the silence A DISTANT 
	SHRIEK SOUNDS, maybe metal against metal or maybe human, 
	somewhere in the ship. He holds there, listening.

<b>				GREER
</b>		Dodge?

	He moves on, shinning his light as he goes.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
</b>
	Greer moves along in the darkness when he hears THE SHRIEKING 
	AGAIN coming from somewhere in the ship.

<b>				GREER
</b>		Dodge!

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
</b>
	Greer walks up a stairway, stepping into a darkened 
	passageway. The SHRIEKING SOUNDS, THIS TIME CLOSER, as it 
	echoes through the ship. He stops, holding there to listen.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
</b>
	Greer comes out onto another deck, stopping there. He looks 
	down the passageway a beat, then moves on. He passes through 
	a hatchway in a bulkhead when A MUSIC BOX CAN BE DISTANTLY 
	HEARD. He stops. The song is "DAISY" ("Daisy, Daisy, give me 
	your answer do. I'm half crazy, oh for the love of you.").

	He holds there, listening intently. A door stands open at 
	the other end of the passage. The MUSIC COMES FROM HERE. He 
	moves forward, walking toward the end of the passage, and 
	the light falling from the open door.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
	Murphy pages forward to the last page of the radio call log 
	book.

	On the page his finger runs down the columns of entries, 
	coming to "TRANSMISSION 1 Feb 53 21:34 hrs GMT. Engine trouble 
	notification made to passing vessel 'St. Charles.'"

	His finger moves down to the next entry, coming to: 
	"TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 09:52 hrs GMT. Dead in Water.  
	Notification made to passing vessel 'Normandy.'"

	His finger continues: "TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 14:07 hrs GMT.

	vessel 'China Sea.'"

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Captain relieved of command.

	He holds there a moment, moving his finger down to the final 
	entry, reading: "TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 21:24 hrs GMT. General 
<b>	SOS."
</b>
	He turns the page to see only the words "GOD SAVE US" scrawled 
	in faded red ink. A beat as he holds there, when a CHANNEL 
	OPENS WITH A SHORT BURST ON MURPHY'S RADIO. He looks to it, 
	but there is no response from the other end. Another SHORT 
	BURST AND THE CHANNEL OPENS AGAIN. This time it remains open, 
	but no one says anything on the other end, UNTIL THE CHANNEL 
<b>	CLOSES AGAIN.
</b>
	Murphy takes the radio.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		This is Murphy. Anybody trying to 
		call me? Over.

	He waits as no response comes, then THE CHANNEL OPENS AGAIN.  
	Only silence from the other end as someone seems to be there, 
	but is not saying anything. Murphy presses the talk button.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Greer? Dodge?

	Again, there is no response, until the CHANNEL OPENS. Murphy 
	holds there as he is answered by silence, WHEN A GRAVELLY, 
<b>	STRANGELY DISTORTED MALE VOICE COMES BACK ON THE RADIO:
</b>

	As Murphy comes to the door to see Dodge standing in the 
	middle of the cabin.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		I found him like this.

	Greer is lying supine on the floor. His legs are rigid and 
	his trunk is extended. His arms are flexed and twisted so 
	that the palms are facing away, fingers splayed, wrists 
	quaking over his chest as they fight to touch each other.

	Murphy kneels beside him. Greer's eyelids are half closed, 
	his eyes rolled up into his head. His jaw is clenched, face 
	contorted in a bizarre grimace. And he speaks, uttering 
	nonsense words in harsh expulsions, as though speaking in 
	tongues.

<b>	AN EYE - EXTREMELY CLOSE
</b>
	As a light shines in it, the pupil is fixed and dilated.

<b>				EPPS (O.S.)
</b>		Hard to say.

<b>	BACK TO SCENE
</b>
	Greer lies unconscious on a bunk, now quiet, no longer seizing 
	as Epps shines a flashlight into his eye, Dodge and Murphy 
	looking on. She turns it off, standing upright.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a 
		coma.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		A what?

<b>				EPPS
</b>		I don't know what else you'd call 
		it. He's breathing on his own, but 
		his pupils are completely blown out. 
		He's totally unresponsive to pain.
			(a beat)
		What happened up there?

<b>				DODGE
</b>		I heard a scream. When I got there I 
		found him on the floor. He was having 
		some kind of seizure. I didn't see 
		anybody else.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		He must've seen something.

	A beat as they consider this.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Other than the obvious, there's 
		nothing wrong with him that I can 
		see, not on the outside.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		Then what the hell happened to him?

	Another beat as they hold there.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Just before I heard him yell there 
		was somebody on the radio.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Greer?

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		I don't know. No. Not Greer.  
		Somebody.

	Another long beat as they think about this.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		It was a man's voice. Repeating some 
		sort of children's rhyme. I don't 
		know, it didn't make any sense. You 
		didn't hear it?

<b>				DODGE
</b>		Not me.

	Another beat as this sinks in.

<b>				EPPS
</b>			(looking to Greer)
		He needs a doctor.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many 
		signal flares you can scrounge up.
			(to Epps, meaning 
			Dodge)
		Keep an eye on him.

	comes open and Murphy steps in.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		How's he doing?

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Same. Any luck?

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		No. I'll try again later.

	A beat as they look on at Greer.

<b>	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT
</b>
	Murphy and Epps sit at the galley table. Epps reads the log 
	book Murphy found in the radio room.

<b>				EPPS
</b>			(reading it)
		They're dead in the water that 
		morning. Four hours later the 
		captain's relieved of his command.  
		And that evening they issue a general 
<b>		SOS.
</b>
<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Possibly false. Hence the IMA record 
		of being lost at sea. I don't think 
		mutiny's out of the question here.

<b>				DODGE
</b>			(taking a seat)
		On a passenger ship in 1953?

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		If they knew what they were carrying.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		You're saying they mutinied for the 
		gold?

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		If they were close enough to shore, 
		they probably figured they could get 
		away in the lifeboats.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Only something must've gone wrong.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		Yeah, way wrong.

	A beat as they consider it.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		So. I got a question. Just from a, 
		you know, purely technical standpoint. 
		We call the Coastguard.  Coastguard 
		shows up. What exactly is the plan?

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		How do you mean?

<b>				DODGE
</b>		Well, they're gonna be asking a lot 
		of questions. About us. About those 
		bodies. About the gold. Seems like 
		we oughta be prepared is all.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		I guess the best strategy's just to 
		tell them the truth.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		Yeah, well. The truth is one thing.  
		When there's more than a few hundred 
		million dollars involved, that's a 
		whole new deal.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		What do you propose?

<b>				DODGE
</b>		For starters, getting that gold off 
		the ship. What they don't know about 
		isn't gonna bother them.

	A beat as Murphy holds there.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		There's no way we're gonna hide a 
		few thousand pounds of gold from the 
		Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be 
		safer where it is.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		With all due respect, skipper.
			(a beat)
		Part of that up there's mine. I'd 
		kinda like to have a little say in 
		what happens to it.

	A beat as Murphy looks on.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Tell you what, Dodge. Once we get 
		back to shore, you can do whatever 
		you want with your share. But until 
		then, the gold stays right where it 
		is.

	Dodge holds there. He looks to Epps a beat, takes a drink of 
	coffee.

<b>	EXT. CHIMERA - DAY

	The sun comes up over a spectacular cloud bank as the Arctic 
	Warrior drifts alongside the Chimera.

	Murphy crosses to the deck house, climbs the stairs.

<b>	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
	Murphy opens the door, stopping dead in his tracks. A beat.  
	He steps forward, crossing to the corner.

	The radio set lies before him, dented in and completely 
	demolished, as if someone had taken a bat to it.

<b>	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
</b>
	Dodge works on one of the turbines when he is grabbed from 
	behind and shoved into the wall. Murphy holds him fast.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Just what the hell do you think you're 
		doing?!

<b>				DODGE
</b>		I don't know what you're talking 
		about?

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		I think you know.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		Maybe you can tell me then.

	Murphy shoves him hard into the wall.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		The radio!

<b>				DODGE
</b>			(not having a clue)
		The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.

	Murphy tightens his grip.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		Take it easy, willya? What about the 
		radio?!

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		You smashed it!

<b>				DODGE
</b>		What?!

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Don't lie to me!

<b>				DODGE
</b>		What the fuck -- ?

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		You didn't want us calling anybody.  
		Too liable to ruin your big payday.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		I didn't touch the fucking radio.

	Murphy tightens his grip still more.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		I didn't touch the fucking radio!
			(a beat)
		Ever occur to you there's somebody 
		else on that boat, skipper?

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Conveniently enough for you.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		Look, I didn't touch it. Alright?

	Murphy holds there a beat longer. He shoves Dodge back letting 
	him go.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		Jesus.

	Dodge checks his throat as Murphy looks on.

<b>				EPPS (O.S.)
</b>		Murphy.

	They turn to see Epps in the hatchway.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		It's Greer.

<b>	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
</b>
	Greer stands at the galley sink finishing off the last of a 
	jug of water as Murphy and the others step in. He turns to 
	see them.

<b>				GREER
</b>		Never been more thirsty in my life.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Drink up then.

	Greer smiles, raising the jug to drink as the others take a 
	seat, looking on at him.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		How're you feeling?

<b>				GREER
</b>		Lost my sea legs.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Any dizziness?

<b>				GREER
</b>		No.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Headache, nausea, lights?

<b>				GREER
</b>		Lights?

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Sudden flashes of light.

<b>				GREER
</b>		I feel fine.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		What day is it?

<b>				GREER
</b>		I don't know. Tuesday?

<b>				DODGE
</b>		Wrong. It's Friday.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Try Wednesday.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		Right. Wednesday.

	A beat as they all hold there. Greer takes a seat.

<b>				GREER
</b>		What happened?

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		You don't remember?

<b>				GREER
</b>		Last thing I remember I was aboard 
		the Chimera. Down somewhere in there 
		scavenging around.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		You've been out for about a day.

<b>				GREER
</b>		Say what?

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Dodge found you out cold in one of 
		the cabins.

	Greer only holds there.

<b>				GREER
</b>		Oh, man.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		We heard you scream. Any idea what 
		you might've seen?

<b>				GREER
</b>		I wish I could tell you. I'd be real 
		interested to know myself.

	Another beat as they hold there, as Greer takes another drink 
	of water.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		The ah... the radio's out.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		What?

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Somebody took it out of commission 
		last night.

	A beat as they all hold there.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Smashed it up pretty bad.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		But, who -- ?

<b>				DODGE
</b>		The skipper seems to think I did it. 
		That I'm more interested in that 
		gold than my own safety or the safety 
		of my fellow shipmates.

	A beat as they hold there, as Murphy looks back.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Did you?

<b>				DODGE
</b>		Hell no. You think I'm crazy?

	Another beat as they hold there.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Regardless of how it happened, there 
		isn't much of a chance to fix it. 
		The odds of another vessel in range 
		of the walkie-talkies are almost 
		astronomical. So, as of today, we're 
		pretty much on our own out here.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - DAY

	Epps and Murphy, carrying the shotgun, make their way in the 
	ship.

<b>	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - FIRST MATE'S QUARTERS - DAY
</b>
	Greer stops before a mirror to see himself. He finds an 
	aspirin bottle, goes to open it. And as he does so, he sees 
	that his hand is shaking uncontrollably.

<b>	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - DAY
</b>
	Dodge works over the turbine. He stops, holding there. He 
	looks on at the plugs and wires and hoses. A beat.

	He begins pulling out the hoses and wires, grabbing at them, 
	yanking them loose, breaking them off.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - DAY
</b>
	The chassis comes off an old radio to reveal a dusty 
	assortment of tubes and condensers. Murphy looks on at it.

<b>	WITH EPPS
</b>
	A tattered, bound book lies in the refuse of a forgotten 
	corner. Epps picks it up. The cover has been ripped off and 
	the pages are torn. But, as she looks through it, she sees 
	that it is the ship's log.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Murphy.

	Murphy steps over as she pages through the log book to the 
	very end. The last pages have been ripped out.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Looks like part of the general log.

	Epps points to a page that has been incompletely ripped out.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		"The crew have gone mad with greed 
		and fight among themselves like wild 
		dogs over fresh kill."

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		February first.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		The same day she supposedly went 
		down.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Must not've been the captain's entry. 
		He was probably out of the picture 
		by then.

	Epps continues to read.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		"Their lacking diligence has 
		undoubtedly caused the collision.  
		Distress calls have been made."

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Collision? With what?

<b>				EPPS
</b>		The page's missing. Then their SOS 
		was real.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		But where's the damage?

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Maybe the other ship took the worst 
		of it.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		If it was a ship she hit.

	A beat as they hold there, when his radio CRACKLES TO LIFE.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		Dodge to Murphy!

	Murphy reaches down for his radio.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>			(to radio)
		Yeah.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		You better get down here right now!  
		We're taking water! Big time!

<b>	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY
</b>
	Murphy and Epps jump from the deck crane as the tug is 
	starting to list to one side. He crosses to the deck house 
	and the open engine room hatch to see that it is rapidly 
	filling with seawater as Greer and Dodge scramble to set a 
	pump hose over the DIN OF THE PUMPS.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		What the hell happened!

<b>				DODGE
</b>		Turbine chamber on number two must've 
		blown! Took out part of the hull!

<b>				GREER
</b>		We're not gonna be able to pump it!

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Alright. Everybody grab your gear!  
		This' is where we get off!

<b>	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
</b>
	The tug is listing radically to the side, its deck awash 
	with seawater, as Epps, Greer, and Murphy scramble with their 
	gear to the crane.

	Water is starting to pour out of the deckhouse hatch as the 
	towering framework rising over the pilothouse stabs 
	precariously at the bow of the Chimera.

	Murphy stops to shout back at the deckhouse.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Dodge!

<b>	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
	Water is starting to pour in as the entire cabin lurches to 
	one side. Dodge wades through toward the door.

<b>	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
	Epps pulls herself up onto the deck, Greer following behind, 
	then Murphy.

	Dodge can be seen stepping from the deckhouse on the tug, 
	which now lists at a near 45 degree angle.

<b>	WITH DODGE
</b>
	Dodge stumbles toward the bow, slipping on the wet deck. He 
	goes down, sliding into the water that washes over the 
	starboard rail.

	He pulls himself up, using a cleat to push off. A deck locker 
	opens and the contents tumble around him. He struggles to 
	pull himself up to the base of the pilothouse. He climbs up 
	and edges his way toward the bow.

<b>	WITH THE OTHERS
</b>
	Epps, Greer and Murphy look on as Dodge climbs up on the 
	skewed deck crane.

<b>	WITH DODGE
</b>
	The tug is slowly lurching over as Dodge climbs the crane, 
	the top of which is sweeping away from the Chimera.

	Below, the decks of the tug are swept with seawater as it 
	sinks lower and lower.

<b>	WITH THE OTHERS
</b>
	They look on as Dodge climbs toward them, the sinking tug 
	pulling Dodge and the crane away from the ship.

	Greer pulls back a line, tying it into the deck railing.

<b>	WITH DODGE
</b>
	As Dodge makes his way up, he's forced to climb onto the 
	other side of the crane to keep from dangling over the water.

	Above, Greer casts a line. It falls near, but out of reach 
	as the swell of the water starts to swing the crane to and 
	fro.  Dodge reaches out for the line again, his hand coming 
	close but not close enough.

	The swell brings the crane toward the boat one last time and 
	Dodge reaches out, his fingers just coming to the line, 
	coaxing it into his grasp. He pulls it back and hangs on, as 
	the crane sways back with the foundering boat.

	The crane falls away from Dodge, leaving him hanging in space 
	by the line from the bow of the Chimera.

<b>	WITH THE OTHERS
</b>
	Murphy, Greer and Epps look on as Dodge hangs over the water 
	and the tug as its stern slowly sinks beneath the waves.

	Dodge climbs the line toward the bow railing as the tug rolls 
	still further to port, the pilothouse dipping into the sea, 
	slipping lower and lower.

<b>	WITH DODGE
</b>
	As he pulls himself upward, coming to the bottom of the rail 
	well on the Chimera where Murphy reaches out, just short of 
	Dodge's hand.

	A SCREECHING SOUNDS and they turn to see the twin tow cables 
	coming taught against the hull in the anchor alley's of the 
	Chimera as the sinking tug pulls them tight.

	With a CONCUSSIVE STRIKE, one cable is freed, snapping against 
	the Chimera's hull like a giant steel guitar string.  It 
	starts sliding along the hull as the tug drifts, pulling the 
	cable with it, toward Dodge as he dangles in mid air.

	Dodge pulls himself up, reaching for Murphy, but still short.

	A LOUD HISSING SOUNDS and Dodge turns to see misty air 
	escaping from ports and deck vents as the encroaching water 
	forces it out of the tug below decks.

	The tow cable LOUDLY SCRAPES THE HULL in a shower of rust, 
	as Dodge struggles to pull himself up.

	Murphy reaches out as Dodge extends as far as he can, their 
	hands barely reaching.

	The tow cable is a mere few feet away and closing, ready to 
	scrape Dodge into the water or smear him across the hull 
	like a bug on a windshield, when Dodge pulls himself up with 
	everything he's got and Murphy grabs his hand.

	Murphy pulls, lifting Dodge, as Greer grabs Dodge's other 
	hand and they pull him up, the tow cable sweeping by with a 
<b>	SICKENING GRINDING SOUND OF HEAVY STEEL AGAINST STEEL.
</b>
	Dodge turns to see the bow of the tug dip below the surface, 
	slowly going under until disappearing with a last exhalation 
	of misty air. The pilothouse is next to go, the last of it 
	slipping into the frothing water, then the crane, finally 
	disappearing altogether into the depths.

	A long beat as they hold there in the sudden silence, phantom 
	bubbles rising to the surface where the tug once stood.

<b>	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY
</b>
	A boot punches through a rotten wood hull.

<b>				MURPHY (O.S.)
</b>		That just about says it all.

	Greer stands at the bow of a lifeboat suspended from halyards 
	above the deck.

<b>				GREER
</b>		Rotten stem to stern. Guess you 
		couldn't expect much else.

	Greer jumps down as Murphy, Dodge, and Epps look on.

<b>				GREER
</b>		We ain't exactly in what you'd call 
		your high traffic neighborhood either.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		The coast guard has our last position. 
		They'll send somebody out soon enough. 
		A ship this size you can't exactly 
		miss.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		It's a good bet they'll be asking a 
		lot of questions when they get here 
		too.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Let 'em ask. This ship's legally 
		ours now.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		When they find out what it's carrying, 
		they may not be so interested in 
		what's legal.

<b>				GREER
</b>		Maybe you shoulda thought a that 
		before you scuttled our boat.

	Dodge turns to see Greer. A beat.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		The turbine blew.

<b>				GREER
</b>		Lemme see, was that before or after 
		the oil fire?

	A beat. Dodge takes a swing at Greer.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>			(grabbing Dodge)
		Easy, easy.

	Murphy holds on to Dodge as he will have none of it.

<b>				GREER
</b>		Gettin' a little hot under the collar, 
		I'd say.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Shut up.

<b>				GREER
</b>		Must be a little too the truth, eh 
		Dodge?

	Dodge jumps forward again, but Murphy hangs on.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		I said, shut the hell up.

	Murphy shoves Dodge back.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Both of you. I don't want to hear it 
		again.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT
</b>
	Dodge moves in the darkness, coming to the corner where the 
	stacked gold ingots rest. He looks on at them.

<b>				MURPHY (O.S.)
</b>		You shouldn't be down here alone.

	Dodge turns to see Murphy standing there.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		Just wanted to check on our little 
		baby.

	A beat as they look on at the gold.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		That oughta buy a man pretty much 
		anything he wants.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		If money can buy what he wants.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		I don't figure there's much I want

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Then you're a lucky man.

	Murphy tosses the shotgun to Dodge, who catches it.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. 
		You're up first.

</b>		Right.

	Murphy holds there a beat longer, then turns to go, as Dodge 
	looks after him.

	Epps scavenges for food in the semi-darkness of the large, 
	open galley, when a MOVEMENT CAN BE HEARD SOMEWHERE BEYOND 
	THE ENTRY separating the galley from the outer passageway.

	No one answers. She looks off across the stillness of the 
	galley. Nothing.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
</b>
	Epps steps into the passageway. Directly across is the entry 
	to the swimming pool. She walks on.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - DAY
</b>
	Epps steps in. Light falls in from the dirty port holes at 
	the ceiling, every movement echoing off the hard tile walls.  
	She holds there a beat, then turns to go when she sees a 
	GIRL of about 16 facing her on the other side of the pool.

	Epps holds there, as the girl only looks back. She is 
	porcelain white, flaxen hair drawn behind her head, her 
	clothing hanging loosely from a frail body.

<b>				GIRL
</b>		You must leave.

	A beat as Epps stands there.

<b>				EPPS
</b>			(finally)
		Who are you?

	From this distance and in the light it is hard to fully 
	discern the girl's features.

<b>				GIRL
</b>		There's great evil here, more than 
		you can know. Leave now or you may 
		never leave.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		But --

	A HATCH CLOSES SOMEWHERE IN THE SHIP. Epps turns to look.  
	When she turns back the girl is gone. A quiet "TICK" SOUND 
	ECHOES in the pool. She looks down to see that the pool is 
	now very, very deep, like a mine shaft falling away into the 
	depths. And, as she stands there, dark water is quickly rising 
	up from the bottom.

	She steps back as the water gradually fills the pool to the 
	top. It is very dark and the bottom is indiscernible, when 
	the water begins to churn, as from bubbles of air reaching 
	the surface. Epps steps closer, looking on as a faint red 
	glow can be seen deep in the water below the churning bubbles.

	As she watches, the red glow grows in intensity. The glow 
	spreads, illuminating a broad area until it becomes clear 
	that the water is not water at all but blood.

	And, as the light grows still brighter, a figure is 
	illuminated, well below the surface as it seems to rise up.  
	Epps looks on as the figure rises higher into the light. It 
	is a MAN, fighting desperately to reach the surface. The 
	bubbles that rise up are produced from his silent screams.

	Epps starts forward, but another figure rises to the same 
	point, a WOMAN, also struggling. Another MAN floats up, then 
	another, and another, people floating up, fighting desperately 
	to reach the surface, unable to do so, drowning in blood.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		My God....

	Epps reaches out over the edge, plunging her hand into the 
	blood, reaching for the man's hand, but they are too far 
	apart.

	She struggles desperately as the man fights to get to the 
	surface.

	The others are fighting for the surface too, as Epps reaches 
	out, near tears, helpless to do anything.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		No!!

	Everything suddenly stops. A beat as Epps only holds there.

	The blood is gone, as are the people. The pool is back to 
	its normal state as though nothing had happened, Epps looking 
	on in disbelief.

<b>				MURPHY (O.S.)
</b>		You okay?

	Epps looks up to see Murphy standing at the door.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Yeah.
			(looking back to the 
			pool)
		Yeah, fine.

	A beat as she holds there, looking on at the pool.

<b>	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREWARD DECK - NIGHT
</b>
	Greer, Murphy, Dodge, and Epps sit on deck around the fire.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		You'd think on a ship this size 
		there'd be something left to eat.

<b>				GREER
</b>		After fifty years there ain't nothin' 
		left but shoe leather.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find 
		some line and tackle. Use some of 
		those bodies below decks for bait.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		There's a charming thought.

<b>				GREER
</b>		We can always start shooting birds.

	Epps coaxes a hit out of her last cigarette.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		What say, Epps? You up for some 
		roasted albatross?

<b>				EPPS
</b>			(snuffing it out)
		Why not?

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - 1ST OFFICER'S STATEROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	The SOUND OF SOMEONE BREATHING HARD CAN BE HEARD in the dark 
	room. As the CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES INTO THE ROOM, we see that 
	it is Greer, lying on the bed. His body is tense and his 
	arms arch rigidly toward his chest. His jaw is clenched and 
	he expels harsh, guttural utterances, experiencing something 
	between a night terror and a seizure.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - WHEELHOUSE - DAY
</b>
	Sheets of rain come down on the deck in the grey light of 
	morning. Murphy stands on the bridge, looking off at it coming 
	down when Greer steps in.

<b>				GREER
</b>		Looks like we're in a strong current.
			(closing the door)
		Must be making almost five knots 
		full on ass backwards.

	Greer crosses to the window, stepping up.

<b>				GREER
</b>		Nasty little swell outa the north 
		west too.

	Murphy nods as he looks out.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Let's just hope somebody sees us 
		first out here.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - PURSERS OFFICE - DAY
</b>
	A file drawer comes open, revealing ticket receipts.

	Epps looks on at it. The receipts are labeled "FULL FARE 
	PASSAGES" and are divided by first, second, and third class.  
	She goes through them, coming to a section that says 
<b>	"ACCOMPANIED CHILDREN."
</b>
	She pulls out the folder, laying it on the counter, opening 
	it. The first page is a receipt for a single passage to 
	Halifax for a Tatterly, Stephen age: 14. She pulls it back 
	to reveal another, Wilson, Harold age: 4. Another, Vitti, 
	Angela age: 17.

	She pages through the stack, looking at the ages: 3, 15, 6, 
	11, 1, until coming across a 9. She looks to the name, Klein, 
	David, a boy. She continues paging through the receipts coming 
	to another 9. She stops, looking to the name, Nichols, 
	Katherine age: 16. A girl. She looks to the cabin assignment: 
	"400." She notes that it is the same cabin where Greer was 
	found, when a REVERBERANT CONCUSSION SOUNDS THROUGH THE SHIP.

<b>	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
	Dodge runs to the side to see a 15 feet wide by 40 feet tall 
	steel and concrete mid-ocean buoy bounce off the transom as 
	the ship drifts into it.

<b>	WITH GREER AND MURPHY
</b>
	They come to the side at the wheelhouse, seeing the bright 
	orange letters "NOAA" emblazoned on the buoy's float pod as 
	the ship drifts by.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		It's a Noaa buoy.

<b>				GREER
</b>		A what?

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Government weather. It's got a 
		transmitter aboard.

<b>	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
</b>
	Dodge quickly ties a loop in a coil of docking line as Greer, 
	Epps, and Murphy look on at the approaching buoy.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Let's go, let's go, let's go.

	Dodge finishes as Epps ties the other end off to a cleat.

<b>	ON THE BUOY
</b>
	As it drifts along the side of the Chimera. Murphy drops the 
	line down, the buoy bouncing on the swell.

<b>	BACK TO SCENE
</b>
	Murphy pulls the loop up as the buoy nears, aiming to hook 
	it on its wind gauge.

<b>	ON THE BUOY
</b>
	The buoy approaches, rising and falling with the swell.

<b>	BACK TO SCENE
</b>
	Murphy corrects.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Higher. You're gonna miss it.

	Murphy holds the loop steady.

<b>	ON THE BUOY
</b>
	The loop is too low. It's going to miss the mark as the buoy 
	drifts toward it, when the swell drops and the buoy goes 
	down.

<b>	BACK TO SCENE
</b>
	Murphy yanks on the line.

<b>	ON THE BUOY
</b>
	And the loop catches on the wind gauge.

<b>	BACK TO SCENE
</b>
	As the line goes taught he pulls his hands away just in time, 
	the line snapping hard against the rail. Below, the buoy 
	heels over as it's pulled.

<b>	ON THE BUOY
</b>
	It drops with the swell, the line stretching, then swinging 
	the giant concrete buoy float into the side of the hull with 
	a huge BOOMING CLANG.

<b>	BACK TO SCENE
</b>
	The line is smoking with the friction, the steel railing 
	bowing a little with the weight as they look on.

<b>				GREER
</b>		We're still drifting.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		The mooring hasn't come taught.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		It's not gonna hold us.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Doesn't matter.

<b>	ON THE BUOY
</b>
	As the buoy falls again with a swell and slams into the side 
	of the ship. The water returns, lifting it high.

	The ship is dragging it back and it begins to rise up as its 
	mooring comes taught. The line rises with it and soon the 
	buoy is at a steep angle as it comes out of the water.

<b>	BACK TO SCENE
</b>
	The buoy is held fast between the docking line and its own 
	mooring.

<b>	ON THE BUOY
</b>
	The buoy rises fully from the water, all three tons of it, 
	and as it does, the wind gauge's steel mount begins to bend.

<b>	BACK TO SCENE
</b>
	As they watch the buoy suspended over the water between the 
	creaking docking line and its own underwater mooring cable.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		No fucking way.

<b>	ON THE BUOY
</b>
	The gauge mount snaps and the docking line flails free, 
	sending the buoy hurtling back into the water in a curtain 
	of spray, whipping wildly from side to side.

<b>	BACK TO SCENE
</b>
	The buoy swings back and forth as it rights itself, rising 
	on a swell, passing beyond the bow of the Chimera.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Damn it.

	They look on in silence, the buoy slowly receding as the 
	ship drifts away.

<b>	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT
</b>
	Murphy stands watch by the fire as Epps joins him.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Hey.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Hey.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Couldn't sleep.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Wish I could say the same.

	They watch the fire in silence for a moment.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		What do you think happened on this 
		boat?

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		I guess that's the sixty four thousand 
		dollar question, isn't it?

<b>				EPPS
</b>		The what?

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Never mind. Before your time.
			(a beat)
		I think at least some of the crew 
		went a little nuts. The usual stuff 
		that happens when people stumble on 
		a fortune. Equal parts greed and 
		paranoia, usually resulting in 
		homicide. What happened after that 
		is anybody's guess. But, judging by 
		our Greek friends down below, it 
		doesn't look like the last time.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Are we smart enough to avoid that?

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		I don't know, are we?

	A beat as she looks back at him. She looks back to the fire, 
	watching it.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		When you found me yesterday, at the 
		pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Not our mystery guest again.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		No. Someone else. A girl.
			(hesitating, a beat)
		I'm not sure she was... real.

	She looks up to Murphy.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Not real?

	A beat as she only looks back.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		What, like some kind of ghost?

<b>				EPPS
</b>		I don't know what else you'd call 
		her. One second she was there, the 
		next she was gone.

	Another beat as he looks on at her.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		And I had a kind of hallucination.
			(a beat)
		There were others. I saw them in the 
		pool. Drowning.

	A beat as Murphy looks back, as she sees him.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Maybe hallucination is the wrong 
		word. It was more than that. As though 
		they were showing me.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Showing you what?

<b>				EPPS
</b>		What happened.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Maybe it was one of them did the 
		handy work on those Greeks.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		No. I think they are, were, just 
		passengers. Innocent victims.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Victims of what?

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Something bad happened here, Murphy.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		That much I think we've already 
		established.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		More than just a mutiny. More than 
		just the gold.

	A beat as he holds there.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		She said the ship was evil. That we 
		had to leave right away. That if we 
		didn't, we might never leave.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		What's that supposed to mean?

<b>				EPPS
</b>		I don't know.

	A beat as she looks back.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Why you? How come the rest of us 
		haven't seen these people?

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Just lucky I guess.

	Another beat as he holds on her.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Well. Getting off this ship's exactly 
		what we're trying to do.  Short of 
		that, I don't know what else to tell 
		you.

	She only looks back at him, then into the fire.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Do me a favor and wake up Dodge.  
		He's next on.

	She starts to get up.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		And Epps?

	She stands, looking back at him.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		You can tell the others about this.  
		But, for my money, I think it's best 
		you keep it to yourself.

	She holds there a beat longer, then turns, walking off.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - LATER - DAY
</b>
	Epps comes to the 2nd officer's door, knocks.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Dodge.
			(no answer, knocking 
			again)
		Dodge.

<b>				DODGE (O.S.)
</b>			(finally, from inside)
		What?

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Get up.

<b>				DODGE (O.S.)
</b>		Yeah, yeah.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - 4TH OFFICERS ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Epps sits down on the bed. She lies back, not sleepy. A beat 
	as she holds there in the darkness.

<b>	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT
</b>
	Murphy still sits by the fire as Dodge groggily approaches 
	from the officers quarters, carrying a blanket and a jug of 
	water.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		You're late.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		Sorry.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>			(handing him the 
			shotgun)
		Don't fall asleep.

<b>				DODGE
</b>			(laying out his blanket)
		Right.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - 1ST OFFICER'S STATEROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Greer lies asleep on the bed. But his sleep is fitful, 
	increasingly agitated, tormented. It is as if he tries to 
	speak, but cannot. As THE CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN, his words 
	are forced and garbled, speaking in the same nonsensical 
	language he spoke earlier, when he wakes with a start.

<b>	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT
</b>
	Dodge dozes, cradling the shotgun in his arms, when MUSIC 
	CAN BE HEARD VERY DISTANTLY. Dodge wakes. It is "Daisy" 
	playing on a music box somewhere in the ship.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
</b>
	Dodge moves along as the MUSIC BOX DISTANTLY CONTINUES.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
</b>
	Dodge moves cautiously down the stairway into another 
	passageway.

	He approaches from the other end. He passes the open doors 
	of stateroom after stateroom. The MUSIC BOX IS CLOSER HERE. 
	It stops.

	He holds there in the darkness. He turns, shining his light 
	back down the passageway. A beat. It is silent, when the 
<b>	CHANNEL OF HIS RADIO OPENS WITH A SHORT BURST.
</b>
	He raises his radio. But no one says anything, the CHANNEL 
	REMAINING OPEN, a discernible presence on the other end.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		Dodge.

<b>	SOMEONE'S POV - FROM THE FAR END
</b>
	SLOWLY MOVING TOWARD DODGE as he can be seen from the other 
	end of the passageway.

<b>	BACK TO SCENE
</b>
	He gets no response, then presses the talk button.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		This is Dodge. Over.

	He is answered by silence, the CHANNEL REMAINING OPEN, WHEN 
<b>	THE GRAVELLY DISTORTED VOICE THAT MURPHY HEARD COMES BACK ON 
</b><b>	THE RADIO:
</b>
<b>				VOICE
</b>		"Cock-a-doodle-doo," said the rooster 
		to the crow. "Where are you now? I 
		know but won't say so."

	Dodge hits the talk button.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		Who is this?

	The RADIO CHANNEL OPENS, but only silence comes back.

<b>				DODGE
</b>		Identify yourself, motherfucker!

<b>	SOMEONE'S POV - FROM THE FAR END
</b>
	SLOWLY MOVING TOWARD DODGE as he can be seen from the far 
	end of the passageway.

<b>	BACK TO SCENE
</b>
	Only silence returns on the radio as Dodge holds there, then:

<b>				VOICE
</b>		Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy.

	THE CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN ON DODGE as he listens.

<b>				VOICE
</b>		Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle toy --
<b>		.
</b>
	Dodge senses something behind him. He turns, and before he 
	can draw a breath to shout, SOMETHING HEAVY SLAMS INTO HIM 
	IN THE DARKNESS, his flashlight tumbling away in a squiggle 
	of light.

<b>	ON SHOTGUN
</b>
	As the shotgun clatters to the deck, the muzzle resting in 
	frame as the radio falls a few feet away. A beat. The shotgun 
	muzzle slides out of frame as some unseen person or thing 
	pulls it away.

<b>	EXT. CHIMERA - DAY
</b>
	A grey overcast stretches to the horizon.

<b>	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - DAY
</b>
	Murphy comes out onto the deck. Dodge is nowhere to be seen.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Dodge?

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY STORAGE COMPARTMENT - DAY
</b>
	Epps shines her light on something.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Check it out.

	Greer raises his light to reveal rows of canned goods. They 
	are industrial sized cans, from the 1950s. Greer takes one.

<b>				GREER
</b>		I don't even want to know what that's 
		gonna taste like now.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Better than starving to death.

	Epps' radio CRACKLES AWAKE.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Murphy to Epps.

<b>				EPPS
</b>			(raising the radio)
		Epps, over.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Either of you seen Dodge?

	She looks to Greer who shakes his head.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Nope.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		He's not on deck and I can't raise 
		him on the radio.

<b>	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - LATER - DAY
</b>
	Dodge's stuff is laid out under the shelter of a vent duct 
	as Greer, Epps, and Murphy stand over it. A blanket, a pillow 
	and a plastic jug of water are all that remain.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		He took the shotgun and a light.

<b>				GREER
</b>		Must've heard something below deck 
		and went down to check it out.

	A beat as they hold there.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Alright. We stay together. Nobody 
		goes any further than earshot.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - DAY
</b>
	Greer and Epps move along as Murphy raises his radio.

		Murphy to Dodge. Murphy to Dodge.  
		Over.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
	Dodge's radio lies in the detritus of the ship as Murphy's 
	voice can be heard on it.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Murphy to Dodge. Do you copy? Over.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - ENGINEERING - LATER - DAY
</b>
	Epps moves cautiously along in the darkness.

<b>				MURPHY (O.S.)
</b>		Epps? You there?

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Right here.

<b>	WITH MURPHY
</b>
	As he moves along as well, eyes open.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Greer?

<b>	WITH GREER
</b>
	As Greer moves along too.

<b>				GREER
</b>		Yeah, yeah.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - LATER - DAY
</b>
	Epps jumps down, shining her light over machinery and across 
	bulkheads when a WHISPERING CAN BE HEARD somewhere. She holds 
	there, listening. It is echoey, distant.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Murphy?

	No response as Epps holds there. The WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN, 
	far off, unintelligible. It stops.

	She moves on, shinning her light.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
</b>
	Epps moves along in the darkness, holding the flashlight 
	before her, when the WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN.

	Epps stops, holding there in the silence. She reaches for 
	her radio. The WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN. Epps turns to pinpoint 
	it, coming from somewhere in the cavernous space.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
</b>
	Epps passes under a catwalk. She moves on, passing a row of 
	standpipes. Epps stops, listening. Somewhere, the WHISPERING 
	CAN BE HEARD, then stops.

	It is absolutely silent. In the darkness behind her, the 
<b>	GIRL (KATIE) PULLS BACK INTO THE SHADOWS.
</b>
	Epps holds there a beat, then turns, running into Greer with 
	a start.

<b>				GREER
</b>		Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.

	She holds there a beat, looking around.

<b>				GREER
</b>		You okay?

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard 
		something is all.

<b>				GREER
</b>		What?

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Nothing. Let's get outa here.

	They start to leave, when Epps notices something. She stops.

	Beyond the standpipes, a faint glow can be seen in the 
	darkness. Epps steps forward, crossing to it. Greer follows.

<b>	MOVING WITH EPPS
</b>
	As Epps approaches, Greer behind her. The light is dim and 
	low to the deck. She stops.

<b>	WITH THE LIGHT
</b>
	As Epps starts toward it again. She and Greer come up to it, 
	stopping there. She kneels, the dim glow shining on her. She 
	reaches out toward it, pulling back Dodge's flashlight, still 
	on.

	She turns it off, standing. She shines her light into the 
	darkness and starts off, Greer following.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
</b>
	Epps and Greer move along, shining their lights as they go, 
	when something catches in the beam of Epps' flashlight.

	It is Dodge's radio. They stop over it. Epps picks it up, 
	inspecting it. She looks to Greer, when a single dark spot 
	appears on Epps' cheek. It begins to run, a crimson tear.

	She raises her hand to touch it, inspecting her finger to 
	see that it is blood.

	She looks to Greer. They both look up to see, hanging 
	suspended above them, Dodge's face staring back down at them 
	from the darkness.

	He has been imperfectly impaled, the sharp point of a high 
	pressure steam pipe protruding from his neck, head hanging 
	limp beside it.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - LATER - DAY
</b>
	Greer and Murphy lower Dodge's body on a rope as Epps guides 
	it to the deck. They stand looking on at it a moment.

<b>				GREER
</b>		Can't find the shotgun.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		So whoever did this now has our 
		shotgun.

<b>				GREER
</b>		Doesn't look like it much matters.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		What do we do with him?

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Leave him till we can get some help.
			(a beat)
		From now on, nobody comes down here.

<b>				GREER
</b>		What about the gold?

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Leave it.

<b>				GREER
</b>		Now hold up just a minute. Let's be 
		reasonable here.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		You think whoever did this is 
		reasonable?

<b>				GREER
</b>		All I'm saying is that gold's worth 
		a lot more to us now than it ever 
		was.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		I can't believe you. Dodge's dead 
		and all you can think about is cashing 
		in your share.

<b>				GREER
</b>		I didn't sign up to go home empty 
		handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll 
		over for the freaky motherfucker did 
		this.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Nobody's going anywhere with that 
		gold now. Anybody tries to board, 
		we'll know about it.
			(a beat)
		You can do what you want, Greer.  
		But neither of us is gonna risk saving 
		your ass down here if it comes to 
		that.

<b>				GREER
</b>		Fine with me.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - DAY
</b>
	Epps enters the dim passageway from the bright daylight. She 
	moves down the passage, coming finally to the stateroom where 
	Greer was found, room 400.

	She holds there a beat, then reaches for the door, hesitating. 
	She opens it.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
	The door comes open and Epps steps in. It is dark, though 
	spacious. It is divided into two rooms. Beyond the sitting 
	room in the front, is a bedroom.

	Epps steps in. A dressing table sits against the far wall.

	A large bed is unmade. Suitcases lie open on stands at the 
	foot of the bed, still half full as if they were in the 
	process of being unpacked.

	From one, she pulls back a woman's gown, a blouse. The other 
	contains shirts, trousers, socks, and underwear.

	Across the room a smaller suitcase can be seen lying open on 
	an Ottoman in the corner. Epps crosses to it. She finds a 
	few shirts, and a red print dress, some books. She takes one 
	of the books, opening it.

	Inscribed on the inside of the cover is: "This book belongs 
	to:" and then written in by hand: "Katie Nichols."

	A page is marked with a purple ribbon. She opens it to see a 
	children's poem "The Rooster and the Crow" and a drawing of 
	a rooster and a crow and a stanza of a poem: "'Cock-a-doodle 
	doo,' said the rooster to the crow. 'Where are you now? I 
	know, but won't say so.'" She puts it down. A tin penny 
	whistle sits on the table. She picks it up, examining it.

	She opens a small picture book, thumbing through to see photos 
	of a family, a young mother and father at the beach, the 
	mother and a girl of about 9 years, the girl and an older 
	girl of about 16, the girl she saw at the swimming pool, 
	KATIE. Epps holds on this picture, when A MUSIC BOX SOUNDS.  
	She looks up to the dressing table. On it a music box slowly 
	plays "Daisy."

<b>	AT THE TABLE
</b>
	Epps crosses to it, looking on at the music box as it slowly 
	winds down, then finally stops. A beat. She picks it up, 
	looking at it, when she looks up to see Greer standing there.  
	A beat.

	The dirty white light falling into the room through the 
	windows falls on him as he looks off at something we cannot 
	see. His expression is empty, hollow.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Greer?

	He does not hear her as he stands there. She approaches, 
	stepping up.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		You okay?

	Another beat, as he looks off, into the light, when he slowly 
	turns to see her.

	A long beat as she looks back. He holds there, the same empty 
	look about him, when he grabs her by the throat and squeezes 
	hard.

	She is stunned, breathless, but raises her hands to grip his 
	wrists, fighting him.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Greer!

	His grip tightens. He is much stronger and her efforts make 
	little difference.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Let go!

	She hangs on, starting to choke. She drops one hand, searching 
	with it.

<b>				GREER
</b>		Oragishlaoomnudrasadrafantoshviska 
		getofedobrodijotosiantosg.

	He speaks nonsense, his face distorted in an ugly grimace, 
	eyes bulging as Epps fumbles over the table, a tray of glass 
	and silver crashing to the floor as he pushes her back, still 
	choking her.

	He backs her to the wall, pushing in, closing her windpipe 
	the rest of the way.

	Her hand searches behind her, knocking over a small vase, a 
	basket, some books. It comes to a brass desk lamp. It falls, 
	a little out of reach.

	She is going to black out any second, as Greer strangles 
	her.

	Her hand comes to the desk lamp, grabbing it.

	She raises the lamp, swinging with all her might, connecting 
	with Greer's head.

	He stumbles back, a gash laid into his face, as Epps sucks 
	in air, gagging and coughing, her neck purple with finger 
	marks.  She fumbles her radio up.

<b>				EPPS
</b>			(into radio)
		Murphy! I'm on C deck, cabin 400!  
		Get down here now!!

	Blood is running down his face as Greer comes for her again.  
	She throws down the radio.

	A bed stands between them. She feints right, then left. He's 
	dazed and has blood in his eyes. She manages to slip by, but 
	he dives, taking her down.

	He drags her back along the floor, spinning her around. He 
	raises a fist to ram into her face when WHAM!

	Epps has shoved the butt of her flashlight into his crotch 
	and he comes up SCREAMING. He grabs her face, striking her 
	with his other hand.

	She swings the flashlight again and cracks him across the 
	head. He swings yet again and connects, knocking her across 
	the floor.

	She lies in a heap as Greer climbs to his feet, enraged and 
	bleeding.

	He unbuckles his belt as he approaches, pulling it from his 
	waist to do God knows what.

	Epps looks around to see him approaching. And we see that 
	she has unhinged her gill knife.

	As his foot steps near, she lets go and drives the knife 
	with all her might into his boot, plunging the blade through 
	his foot and into the floor. He SCREAMS.

	After a moment he stops, looks to her. He is a bloody, 
	wretched, enraged mess. He starts toward her as Murphy appears 
	in the doorway.

	Just as Greer is upon her, Murphy blind sides Greer from 
	behind at full speed, knocking him down.

	Greer and Murphy struggle as Epps climbs unsteadily to her 
	feet. She staggers to them and raises the flashlight over 
	Greer, bringing it down on his head.

	Greer tumbles down a sand bank in an empty aquarium. He stops 
	at the bottom, now starting to come to.

	Murphy slams the door shut as Epps looks on. She puts a steel 
	pipe across the hatch lever so that it cannot be opened.

	Greer sits in the tank, visible through a large piece of 
	armored aquarium glass, amidst the fake coral. He sits in 
	the sand hugging his legs to his chest, bobbing slightly as 
	he speaks in his nonsensical language.

<b>				MURPHY (V.O.)
</b>		Must've been him all along.

	Murphy and Epps look on from the outside in the promenade.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Smashed the radio. Scuttled the boat. 
		Killed Dodge. Would've killed you. 
		He's off his nut, no doubt there.

	They watch him in silence a moment as Greer mutters and bobs.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		What do you think?

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Could be a stroke. Who knows?
			(a beat)
		The general log said the crew were 
		fighting among themselves. "Like

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Over the gold.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Maybe it was more than that.

	Greer gets up, comes to the window, looking out at them. He 
	presses his face to the glass.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		They went crazy.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not 
		like him.

	A beat as Epps looks off. In the window Greer drags his 
	hideously distorted face over the glass, the blood from his 
	wounds smearing in broad red streaks.

	A beat as they look on at the rotting hull.

</b>		If the weather holds it might not be

	Epps has found a reel of wire and some metal braces, making 
	her way into the darkness, when her radio CRACKLES TO LIFE.  
	The channel remains silent a moment, then closes. She stops, 
	raises the radio.

<b>				EPPS
</b>			(holding down talk 
			button)
		Murphy?

	She waits, holding there as only silence comes back.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Murphy, this is Epps. Do you copy?

	Again, only silence comes back until, after a moment, the 
	channel opens again. No one speaks, though there is a palpable 
	presence on the other end.

<b>				EPPS
</b>			(raising the radio)
		Who is this?

	The channel opens again, only silence returning. The sound 
	of the MUSIC BOX CAN BE HEARD, "DAISY" COMING BACK OVER THE 
<b>	RADIO.
</b>
<b>	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
</b>
	Epps walks along in the darkness AS THE MUSIC BOX CONTINUES 
	TO PLAY OVER THE RADIO. She comes to the end of the corridor, 
	stopping there.

	At the other end the light falls from the door at room 400.

	The MUSIC FROM THE RADIO STOPS, leaving in its absence the 
<b>	MUSIC AS IT CAN BE HEARD COMING FROM THE ROOM AT THE END OF 
</b><b>	THE CORRIDOR.
</b>
<b>	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps approaches the other end, from where the MUSIC EMANATES, 
	coming to a stop at room 400. A beat as she holds there.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - ROOM 400 - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
	Epps steps in as THE MUSIC BOX PLAYS IN THE OTHER ROOM.

	The sitting room is dark as she holds there. After a moment, 
	she continues on, coming to the bedroom.

	Epps steps in. Across the room the MUSIC BOX IS PLAYING.

	She crosses, coming to it as it continues, when her radio 
	CRACKLES TO LIFE. The channel remains silent a moment, then:

<b>				VOICE
</b>		"Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster 
		to the crow. Where are you now? I 
		know but won't say so."

	She holds there a beat, then crosses to the table to find 
	the book of nursery rhymes. She opens it to the nursery rhyme 
	"The Rooster and the Crow," seeing the same words on the 
	page, when the radio CRACKLES AGAIN.

<b>				VOICE
</b>		Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy. Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy.

	On the table is the penny whistle she saw earlier. She takes 
	it, holding on it a moment. She raises it and THE CAMERA 
	SLOWLY PUSHES IN as she puts it to her lips and lightly blows 
	a C-SHARP WHICH BECOMES A C-SHARP FROM A PENNY WHISTLE across 
	the room.

<b>				MOTHER
</b>		"Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster 
		to the crow. Where are you now? I 
		know but won't say so."

	On the other side of the room, the younger girl from the 
	photo plays the penny whistle. She is sitting on the floor 
	with the MOTHER who reads from the book we saw earlier.

<b>				MOTHER
</b>		"Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster 
		to the crow. Where are you now? I 
		know but won't say so." Cassandra, 
		if you insist on playing that while 
		I read I'll just stop right now.

<b>				THE GIRL
</b>		Sorry.

	The room is warm with light, restored to its original 
	condition some fifty years ago as Epps stands there, unseen, 
	no longer holding the whistle.

	A man, the FATHER from the photos, steps from the bathroom 
	wearing a new coat.

<b>				FATHER
</b>		What do you think?

<b>				MOTHER
</b>		He certainly did shorten it, didn't 
		he?

<b>				FATHER
</b>		I thought this was all the rage.

<b>				KATIE
</b>		Maybe last year.

	Katie joins them from the outer room.

<b>				FATHER
</b>		What about this year?

<b>				KATIE
</b>		It's not your color anyway.

<b>				GIRL
</b>		I like it, daddy.

<b>				FATHER
</b>		Well thank you!

	Epps steps from room 400 into the passageway. It is lit with 
	sconces running its length and the elegant furnishings and 
	objets d'art stretching to the far end are all in their 
	original condition. DISTANT MUSIC FROM THE BALLROOM CAN BE 
	HEARD as Epps stands there. She moves along.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
</b>
	Epps walks in the passageway. Doors are open and she looks 
	in to see people doing various things, some packing and 
	putting their things in order.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
</b>
	Epps walks down the passage, rounding the corner to see three 
	STEWARDS fighting with a fourth MAN in a tuxedo. They lift 
	him up and carry him off down the stairs as he shouts and 
	protests. She moves on, through a pair of double doors, into

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - STORAGE COMPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
	Epps moves through the now lighted storage area off the 
	galley. A group of CREWMEN stand around at the other end 
	and, as Epps nears, she sees that four figures can be seen 
	among them. They are four men, OFFICERS, swaying gently from 
	the ship's movement as they hang from ropes around their 
	neck, dead. Epps keeps moving, through doors at the other 
	end.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
</b>
	A commotion can be heard at the other end of the passageway 
	as Epps keeps moving. A WOMAN SCREAMS, and is cut off when a 
	door slams shut.

	The DISTANT MUSIC HAS BEEN REPLACED WITH INDISCERNIBLE 
	SHOUTING, as of someone commandeering the microphone somewhere

	As she walks, she passes an open door where several CREWMEN 
	fight over a steamer trunk, which breaks open, scattering 
	the contents.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
</b>
	Epps walks along, coming to another door where a dead man 
	and woman are laying in the middle of the room as a STEWARD 
	takes money from a wallet. The steward looks up, reaches 
	over and slams the door shut. She continues on.

	Another door stands open as she comes to it, back at room 
	400. She stops. A REPETITIVE SOUND CAN BE HEARD, coming from 
	inside.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - ROOM 400 - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
	Epps steps in as the SOUND CONTINUES. She crosses the sitting 
	room, coming to the doorway of the bedroom to find several 
	MUTINEERS, some in stewards attire, others wearing ships 
	officers caps, obviously taken from their rightful owners.

	The repetitive sound comes from here, bed springs. And, from 
	between the men, a woman's bare legs hang over the end of 
	the bed as a pair of man's legs in boots lie between them, 
	the bed rocking, the others looking on.

	Epps turns to see the father. He is on his knees, hands tied 
	behind his back as he is forced to watch from the foot of 
	the bed.

<b>	EPPS LOOKS DOWN TO SEE
</b>
<b>	EPPS' POV
</b>
	a geometric pattern of a lotus on the Persian carpet at her 
	feet. When she looks up again she sees what the father sees.

	The mutineer finishes, climbing off the woman. Another of 
	the men pulls her up to reveal that she is no woman at all, 
	but Katie.

	The mother and sister lie in a bloody heap near-by as one of 
	the other mutineers steps up to Epps.

<b>				MUTINEER
</b>		You like that, daddy? I'll show you 
		something else now.

	The mutineer steps back to the bed. He sits Katie down so 
	that she faces us on the end of the bed. He raises an axe 
	over her, bringing it down as the world becomes a whirling 
	blur --

<b>				EPPS (V.O.)
</b><b>		NO!!!!
</b>
<b>	BACK TO SCENE
</b>
	The CAMERA STOPS ON KATIE standing on the other side of the 
	room, now empty of people, returned to its shabby, abandoned 
	state.

<b>				KATIE
</b>		It isn't real.

	Epps looks back at her from the other side of the room where 
	she stands.

<b>				KATIE
</b>		Many bad things have happened here.  
		But you mustn't allow the evil inside. 
		I tell you this because you can see 
		me. The others can't. But you must 
		leave. You must leave.

	A LOUD GUNSHOT SOUNDS SOMEWHERE IN THE SHIP. When Epps turns 
	back Katie is gone.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps moves quickly along, raising her radio.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Epps to Murphy.

	Only WHITE NOISE COMES BACK.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Epps to Murphy.

	Only WHITE NOISE COMES BACK as she rounds the corner out 
	onto the promenade. At the other end, the aquarium can be 
	seen.

	As she approaches she sees that the tank is empty. Greer is 
	nowhere to be seen and the skylight at the top is broken 
	out.

	A GREAT BOOMING SHUDDER rocks the ship. A LOUD SCREECHING OF 
	METAL follows it.

<b>	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
	The ship's hull being scraped at the waterline by a jagged 
	mid-ocean island no bigger than fifty or sixty feet across.

	Epps moves quickly along, coming to the stairway, moving up, 
	almost running into Murphy on his way down, carrying a canvas 
	duffle.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		What happened?

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		We hit land.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		What?

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		We're in an island chain. It's only

	Epps and Murphy move quickly along, when another HUGE BOOMING 
	shudders the ship and the SHRIEKING OF METAL follows.

	The ship bounces off another of the small, jagged islands as 
	it drifts past, buckling the steel plate of the hull 
	precariously.

	Murphy and Epps run toward the other end of the ship. As 
	they do, something can be seen lying in the middle of the 
	passage some distance down.

<b>	AT THE OTHER END
</b>
	Epps and Murphy slow to see that it is a body, lying face 
	down in the passage.

	They step up. Epps kneels as Murphy looks on. She rolls the 
	body over. It is Greer, dead.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		He's been shot.

	Murphy kneels too, looking on at Greer's lifeless eyes.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Let's get the hell out of here.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		It should be enough to get us to one

		wouldya?

	She joins him and they lift it off its stand, taking it to 
	the rail.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		Prop it here. We need to pull these 
		braces off. There's a hammer on the 
		stand. There.

	Epps crosses back to the stands.

<b>	AT THE STANDS
</b>
	Epps kneels. No hammer. She pulls back Murphy's canvas duffle, 
	folding back the flap to reveal a shotgun, the shotgun Dodge 
	had when he died.

	A beat as she holds there, when Murphy's hand grabs it.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		I'll take that.

	A beat as she looks to Murphy.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		It was you.

	He only looks back at her as she stands there.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		You killed them.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		It was only a matter of time before 
		somebody killed somebody.
			(a beat)
		You saw it coming as well as I did.  
		Dodge had his plans, starting with 
		scuttling the boat. And Greer too, 
		except he went nuts. Couldn't take 
		it, I guess. Could've happened in 
		the middle of downtown Anchorage.  
		But did it make him any less 
		dangerous? I don't think so.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		So you killed them?

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		The way I figure it, it was them or 
		me. I thought putting Dodge up on 
		that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a 
		little time. Made it look like whoever 
		killed those Greeks was still around. 
		But it's just us on this ship. Us 
		and your... spirit friends.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		And now you're gonna kill me, is 
		that it?

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		I didn't want it to turn out this 
		way.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		Murphy, don't you see what's 
		happening?

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		I think I see it pretty well.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		It's the ship. The ship's making you 
		think this way.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		I know a little bit about human nature 
		and what I've seen only confirms 
		that.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		It's a trap. There was no way we 
		were gonna get away with that gold.  
		Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. 
		This ship sucks people in and it 
		never lets them out.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		I think maybe you been on this boat 
		a little too long, with all that 
		supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's 
		nothing supernatural about greed.  
		And that's what it comes down to, 
		pure and simple.

<b>				EPPS
</b>		I don't give a damn about the gold.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		I wish I could believe that. Either 
		way, you know what I've done. I've 
		got no choice.

	He raises the shotgun.

<b>				MURPHY
</b>		I'm sorry.

	He prepares to fire, when a CONCUSSION ROCKS THE SHIP. Epps 
	ducks and Murphy fires, a spatter of buckshot shredding the 
	vent behind her. A SCREECHING OF METAL DEEP IN THE SHIP SOUNDS 
	as she gets up, diving for cover as Murphy shuttles the gun 
	again.

	Epps moves along on a metal catwalk in the darkness when 
	something can be heard ahead of her. She stops.

	FOOTSTEPS SOUND at the end of the passage. Epps pulls back 
	into the shadows, holding there.

	The footsteps sound as if they are coming down stairs at the 
	other end, when the FOOTSTEPS STOP.

	Epps holds there, listening intently in the silence when, at 
	the other end, THE SOUND OF CREAKING METAL, as from a hatch 
	slowly opening, can be heard. It stops. All is silent, WHEN 
	THE HATCH CREAKS AGAIN at the other end. She begins moving 
	toward it.

	As she approaches, she can see that the hatch is half open, 
	swaying slightly with the movement of the ship.

	A CREAKING SOUNDS behind her. She turns, just as Murphy steps 
	into view. She ducks as he fires and a spray of buckshot 
	ricochets off the metal around her.

	She scrambles on her belly as Murphy fires again. She swings 
	down from the catwalk, letting herself fall to the next deck.

</b>
	Epps stops where she is in the cavernous engine room, looking 
	on at the massive hull rising above her as the RUMBLING GROWS 
	IN INTENSITY. Though it seems to resonate throughout the 
	ship, it seems to originate from here, from directly below, 
	as though the hull were being dragged over a rocky bottom.

	She steps back as the sound grows still louder, until it 
	becomes absolutely deafening.

	The ship begins to shudder. The steel bulkheads visibly move 
	and the steel plates in the hull can be seen to bend back 
	and forth.

	Murphy slows and finally stops.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
	A few rivets pop in the hull. Then a few more, as the RUMBLING 
<b>	GROWS STILL LOUDER.
</b>
	Epps puts her hands to her ears and begins to back away, 
	when the RUMBLING REACHES A PINNACLE. The rivets are springing 
	out of the hull like machine gun fire when the steel plate 
	of the hull gives way, A MASSIVE CRAG OF ROCK SMASHING THROUGH 
<b>	WITH A TREMENDOUS BOOM AND A TORRENT OF SEAWATER.
</b>
	Epps ducks for cover as the crag tears a diagonal line through 
	the Chimera's hull like a jagged claw through paper in a 
<b>	HORRENDOUS TUMULT OF NOISE AND STEAM AND SPARKS.

	Epps comes up for air. A clatter of all manner of debris, 
	tools and general detritus hammers against the far bulkhead 
	as the ship eases over. A boiler breaks loose of its stays.

	Epps looks up to see it coming right for her. She ducks under 
	the water as the boiler slams into the bulkhead where she 
	was.

	Epps is forced down by the boiler, trapped between it and

	Epps struggles under the water to free herself, but she is

	The level of the water has now almost completely reached the 
	deck above, filling the ship almost entirely below decks.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO HOLD - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
	The water is threateningly high as Murphy pockets one last 
	ingot and makes his way for the exit.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
	Epps is trying to pull back the boiler stays, without luck.  
	She swims down lower, finding a pipe fitting she pries at 
	the stays, without luck, when a form drifts into view in the 
	murky water.

	Several more forms appear. They are human, suspended in the 
	water. As Epps looks, the several forms have become many.  
	They are the bodies of the dead she saw in the pool before.

	As they look on at her from where they are, one form emerges.  
	It is Katie.

	She reaches toward Epps, as if beckoning her to take her 
	hand from the other side. Epps raises her hand, taking it.

	The girl leads Epps down into the murky darkness where she 
	finds a way out. She takes her back further, coming to the 
	breech, leading her out and into a cool green void of water.

	Katie stops at the breach. Epps turns to her. She only looks 
	back at Epps. Epps turns away, swimming upward toward the 
	light of the surface.

<b>	EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
</b>
	Epps breaks through, gasping for air. She looks to see the 
	Chimera, listing heavily to one side, its bow decks fully 
	awash.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
	Murphy staggers through the flooded passage.

<b>	EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
	The Chimera is getting lower in the water, the bow submerged 
	and the stern beginning to rise.

	Epps sees another small island some distance off. She begins 
	swimming toward it.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
	Water runs down the stairway as Murphy struggles toward the 
	top.

<b>	EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
	Epps swims as the ship sinks in the distance.

<b>	INT. CHIMERA - PROMENADE - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
	A river of water rushes through as Murphy crosses with 
	difficulty.

<b>	EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
	Epps reaches the jagged rock of the island. She pulls herself 
	up.

<b>	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
	Water rushes in as Murphy wades out onto the Chimera's top 
	deck. He is heavily weighted down and periodically goes under 
	as he half wades half swims, the length of the ship's aft 
	portion rising above him as the bow sinks.

<b>	EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS -  DAY
</b>
	Epps collapses on the rocks.

<b>	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
	As the ship moves lower, Murphy pushes off. He bobs under 
	momentarily, then comes back up with difficulty. The forward 
	smoke stack has dipped under and is now taking on water, the 
	current from the rushing water pulling him toward it.

<b>	EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS -  DAY
</b>
	Epps looks on as the giant ship angles higher and higher.

<b>	EXT. CHIMERA - WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
	As the ship dips lower, the rushing water forms an eddy that 
	pulls at Murphy. Murphy struggles, too heavy to resist as he 
	is pulled closer and closer to the sucking maw that is the 
	smokestack's opening.

	The ship sinks further and Murphy is pulled to the edge of 
	the stack. He frantically grabs for something to hold on to, 
	without success, until he is finally pulled into the smoke 
	stack and sucked into the bowels of the ship by the rushing 
	water.

<b>	EXT. ISLAND - LATER - DAY
</b>
	Epps sits perched under a rock out of the wind, looking on 
	at the Chimera, her stern rising high above water as she 
	goes down, when the RUMBLE OF ENGINES CAN BE HEARD.

	She turns to see a Coastguard plane sweeping low over the 
	Chimera, then banking back and flying right over as she shouts 
	and waves her arms.

<b>	EXT. ISLAND - LATER - DAY
</b>
	The Coastguard plane flies by one more time, this time 
	dropping a survival pack.

	The Chimera's stern rises up out of the water, almost vertical 
	now, slipping further and further under.

	Epps looks on one last time, as the ship goes down.

<b>	EXT. OCEAN - WITH CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
	The afterdeck of the Chimera sinks slowly, slowly down, the 
	CAMERA PUSHING IN TO "CHIMERA" as the name comes to the water, 
	then slips slowly beneath the surface. And THE CAMERA FOLLOWS, 
	MOVING INTO THE WATER to reveal that, beneath the surface, 
	there is no ship at all, only the vast empty depths of the 
	ocean.

<b>	FADE TO BLACK
</b>
<b>			 THE END
