In a California forest, a group of alien botanists collect flora samples.
When government agents appear on the scene, the aliens flee in their spaceship, mistakenly leaving one of their own behind.
The scene shifts to a suburban home, where a 10-year-old boy named Elliott is trying to hang out with his 16-year-old brother Michael and his friends.
As he returns from picking up a pizza, Elliott discovers that something is hiding in their tool shed.
The creature promptly flees upon being discovered.
Despite his family's disbelief, Elliott lures the alien from the forest to his bedroom using a trail of Reese's Pieces.
Before he goes to sleep, Elliott realizes the alien is imitating his movements.
Elliott feigns illness the next morning to stay home from school and play with the alien.
Later that day, Michael and their five-year-old sister Gertie meet the alien.
They decide to keep him hidden from their mother.
When they ask it about its origin, the alien levitates several balls to represent its solar system and then demonstrates its powers by reviving a dead plant.

At school the next day, Elliott begins to experience a psychic connection with the alien, including exhibiting signs of intoxication due to the alien drinking beer, and he begins freeing all the frogs in a biology class.
As the alien watches John Wayne kiss Maureen O'Hara in The Quiet Man, Elliott kisses a girl he likes.
