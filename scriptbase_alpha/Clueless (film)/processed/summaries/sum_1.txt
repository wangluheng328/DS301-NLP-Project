Cher is rich, pretty, blonde, popular and knows how to talk anyone into doing just about anything.
When she can't get a teacher to give her a better grade, she and her friend Dion match him up with another teacher to make him happier... and maybe a but laxer on his expectations.
When a girl named Tai transfers to Cher's school, she and Dion give her a makeover and attempt to find her a boyfriend.
Cher soon realizes that she wants a boyfriend herself, but no one seems right.
She goes through a spiritual makeover and realizes that there's more to life than clothes and popularity before she finds the boy of her dreams.
