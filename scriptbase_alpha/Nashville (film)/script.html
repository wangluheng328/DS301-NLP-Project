<b>	FADE IN:
</b>
<b>A	TITLE SEQUENCE
</b>
	Still photos of twenty-four principal actors.

<b>1	CLOSE SHOT - SIGN
</b>
	Nashville Airport.

<b>2	EXT. NASHVILLE AIRPORT - DAY
</b>
	TRICYCLE MAN drives into parking lot and parks next to GREEN'S 
	old Chevy. TRICYCLE MAM: locks his machine and walks toward 
	coffee shop. GREEN gets out of his car, locks it, starts in the 
	same direction. NORMAN parks the limo, goes into main building.

<b>3	INT. AIRPORT - DAY
</b>
	NORMAN is attracted to large “CONNIE WHITE” display.

<b>4	INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
</b>
	At the entrance is another "CONNIE WHITE" display and from the 
	jukebox we hear one of her songs.

	The waitress, SUELEEN, drops a fork, then gets another from an 
	overflowing sink and hands it to her customer, TRICYCLE MAN.

	There are several people at the counter with him, including 
	GREEN, who has just walked in. Another man enters, DELBERT 
	REESE. SUELEEN waits on all of them.

	A small black man comes out of the kitchen, carrying a tray full 
	or dishes. This is WADE.

<b>					WADE
</b>				(to SUELEEN)
			You want a ride into town?

<b>					SUELEEN
</b>			You bet.

	REESE looks up, checking out SUELEEN, then WADE, then the 
	TRICYCLE MAN, then his breast pocket to see it his wallet and 
	checkbook are still there, then he buries himself in his 
	newspaper.

<b>					SUELEEN
</b>			Got me an audition tonight.

<b>					WADE
</b>			Well, you just remember, if you 
			can't kick front, kick back, 'cause 
			at least you're kicking... Ten 
			minutes, okay?

	She nods and talks to the TRICYCLE MAN. REESE keeps sneaking 
	looks at her.

<b>					SUELEEN
</b>			I've just been waiting for the 
			right spot to sing in... I'm so 
			nervous...

	She laughs and starts to rinse the dishes in the sink.

<b>					SUELEEN
</b>			I'm good, though. There ain't but 
			one Sueleen Gay -- I don't mean to 
			be conceited, but really it's true. 
			I've been taking special coaching 
			lessons from Zeke Willard -- he's 
			just wonderful. Teaches you how to 
			phrase; that's really important. 
			And breathing. Well, you know all 
			about that. Anyway, I wrote this 
			song.

	She looks down and then begins to half whisper, sing, and half do 
	all of the gestures for a song she has written as she wipes some 
	glasses. The jukebox continues to play CONNIE WHITE, and every 
	time someone walks by, Sueleen stops. She finally gets through 
	the song and discovers REESE has been watching, too. She looks 
	away from him to the TRICYCLE MAN, who smiles. Be has finished 
	his meal.

<b>					SUELEEN
</b>			Oh, listen, I really do go on. 
			Here's your check. Sure has been 
			nice talking to you.

	As she removes her apron, a HAVEN HAMILTON song comes on the 
	jukebox, "Keep on a goin'."  The TRICYCLE MAN leaves.

<b>	CUT TO:
</b>
<b>5	INT. CONTROL BOOTH - NASHVILLE STUDIO - DAY
</b>
	We hear the last chorus or "Keep on a goin'" as sung by HAVEN, 
	who is recording.

	He is always dressed in white. In the booth are BUD and LADY 
	PEARL. Also present are two engineers and a producer. HAVEN is 
	accompanied by a long haired piano player with a white sweater. 
	HAVEN is not too happy with him. 

<b>6	ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
	OPAL enters the booth, carrying a too-large English tape 
	recorder. HAVEN Stops singing, mad at OPAL'S interruption and 
	the piano player. Through the glass we see him pantomiming 
	instructions for her to leave. As she does, HAVEN starts over.

<b>7	INT. HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
	OPAL wanders to the next studio. BUD follows, apologizing.

<b>					BUD
</b>			Sorry. He sees a tape recorder and 
			gets upset.

	She looks at him.

<b>					BUD
</b>			He's my father.

<b>					OPAL
</b>			Haven Hamilton is your father? Can 
			you arrange an interview?

<b>8	INT. SECOND RECORDING BOOTH - DAY
</b>
	They have entered a different control tooth. In the recording 
	portion, LINNEA and an all-black, male CHOIR sings a gospel song. 
	OPAL asks BUD who this group is.

<b>9	INT. FIRST CONTROL BOOTH - DAY
</b>
	BUD returns. HAVEN has just exploded at the piano player and 
	starts to leave, yelling at the producer.

<b>					HAVEN
</b>			Who the hell is playing piano? Get 
			that hippie out of here... He's got 
			a tin ear. I asked for Pig, dammit. 
			I'm moving on 'cause I gotta get to 
			the airport. When you get my 
			backups straight, then we'll talk 
			about cutting this tune here.

	He heads for the hallway.

<b>10	INT. HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
	It is jammed with black singers from the CHOIR. HAVEN hates 
	being crushed and moves through the congestion like a white 
	knight. OPAL moves near.

<b>					OPAL
</b>			Excuse me, sir. I'm here putting 
			together a film. I would like to 
			ask some questions.

	She has to fumble with the bulky tape machine and transformer.

<b>					HAVEN
</b>			Foreigner?

<b>					OPAL
</b>			I'm from BBC television.

<b>					HAVEN
</b>			Where the hell is that?

	HAVEN nod a politely and leaves the crowded hallway with BUD and 
	PEARL. He spots LINNEA.

<b>					HAVEN
</b>			Linnea.

<b>					LINNEA
</b>			How you doing, Haven?

<b>					HAVEN
</b>			oh, fine. Couldn't be better.

<b>11	ANGLE T0WARD OUTSIDE
</b>
	They all say goodbye and HAVEN'S group gets into a new white jeep

<b>	CUT TO:
</b>
<b>12	EXT. AIRPORT - DAY
</b>
	Barbara Jean's plane taxis to a halt.

<b>13	INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
</b>
	REESE leaves a tip and exits the coffee shop to greet the plane.

	Page Missing

<b>14A	CONTINUED:
</b>
	TOM spots stews and goes to them

<b>					TOM
</b>			You ladies got room for a spare?

<b>					STEW
</b>			Sure.

<b>14B	NEW ANGLE
</b>
	L.A. JOAN is left in the dust.

<b>					L.A. JOAN
</b>			'Bye... nice talking to you.

	GREEN sees his niece and walks over.

<b>					GREEN
</b>			Joan?

	She turns.

<b>					L.A. JOAN
</b>			Did you see who that was?

<b>					GREEN
</b>			Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, 
			too.

<b>					L.A. JOAN 
</b>			He is just wonderful.

<b>					GREEN
</b>			I'1l get your bag.

<b>	CUT TO:
</b>
<b>15	EXT. LANDING AREA - AIRPORT - DAY
</b>
	GLENN has just deposited a postcard in a mailbox and approaches a 
	gathering cluster of people. NORMAN and TRICYCLE MAN are nearby. 
	Everybody is waiting for BARBARA JEAN to appear. GLENN steps 
	close to NORMAN.

<b>					GLENN
</b>			Am I late?

<b>					NORMAN
</b>			Late!  Oh, Jesus!

	He runs off.

<b>16	ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
	As NORMAN runs toward passenger loading, we see HAVEN'S jeep 
	arrive with HAVEN, BUD and PEARL. It parks and all climb out. 
	REESE and TRIPLETTE approach the 'Barbara Jean' plane. BARNETT 
	is already on the runway, making arrangements. HAVEN'S group all 
	shake hands.

<b>					HAVEN
</b>			Delbert, how are you?

<b>					REESE
</b>			I'm fine. This here is John 
			Triplette. Triplette, like you to 
			meet the Honorary Mayor, Haven 
			Hamilton.

<b>					HAVEN
</b>			Good to meet you.
				 (turns to BUD)
			Bud, have them move the horses.

<b>					TRIPLETTE
</b>			Pleasure 

<b>					REESE
</b>			Where is she?

<b>					HAVEN
</b>			Still inside the plane posing for 
			pictures and signing autographs. 
			She's got a new album cut again. 
			She'll be down in a minute. But 
			she'll be late for the Opera if she 
			doesn't hurry. Bud, get the plane on 
			the walkie-talkie.

	BUD fumbles on his walkie-talkie telephone, but can't seem to get 
	anything.

<b>					BUD
</b>			They don't seem to be answering. 
			The ambulance boys are here, though. 
			Barnett always expects them to get 
			there like a shot. That thing only 
			goes a hundred fall bore with the 
			sirens going.

<b>					HAVEN
</b>			Thank you, Bud.

	BUD nods like he has been complimented.

<b>17	ANGLE TOWARD PLANE
</b>
	A wave of noise begins from the fans. The band and majorettes 
	and horses and ropers go into a rendition of one of her hit tunes 
	as BARBARA JEAN appears. Everyone is breaking their neck to see, 
	especially GLENN. HAVEN and REESE give her the first round of 
	applause, then go back to talking. TRIPLETTE has never been 
	exposed to anything quite like this before and stands a little in 
	awe of the situation.

	When the twirling and tricking and music stop, BARBARA JEAN 
	descends the stairs.

<b>					HAVEN
</b>			Bud, tell them to move the horses. 
			Promised this strip would be spic 
			and span.

	He smiles and winks.

<b>					REESE
</b>			Listen, we'll go get the car and 
			come back. This'l1 be going on for 
			a while.

<b>					HAVEN
</b>			You bet. She's probably talking to 
			somebody about their sick child. You 
			know how she is.

	They wave goodbye and head in the direction of the loading zone. 
	Behind them, the horse people disperse and get into their cars 
	and horse trailers, preparing to return to Nashville.

<b>18	ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
	BARNETT comes over to REESE, TRIPLETTE, HAVEN, BUD and PEARL 
	while BARBARA JEAN continues to greet fans.

<b>19	EXT. AIRPORT NEAR PARKING LOT - DAY
</b>
	While the BARBARA JEAN arrival takes place on the runway NORMAN 
	finds BILL and MARY. NORMAN speaks softly and out of breath, 
	trying to pretend he's on time.

<b>					NORMAN
</b>			Hi.

	BILL slaps him on the back and engulfs him.

<b>					BILL
</b>			Hi, Norman.

	NORMAN looks relieved. BILL and MARY have been arguing.

<b>					NORMAN
</b>			Sure is nice to see you all again. 
			I never thought I'd see you again 
			after the last time.

<b>					BILL
</b>			Oh, Norman, you worry too much.

	MARY takes NORMAN'S hand.

<b>					MARY
</b>			Norman, how are you?

	She kisses him and he blushes. BILL and MARY are glad to talk to 
	someone else.

<b>					NORMAN
</b>			Fine. Just fine.

	As they walk to the limo, we see a car with loudspeakers on top 
	of it and clearly written door signs that read: "Replacement 
	Party" in red, white and blue. REESE and TILIPLETTE are walking 
	toward it, shaking hands with several people.

<b>					NORMAN
</b>			Sure have missed you all, though. 
			Oh, where's Tom?  Isn't he with you?

<b>					BILL
</b>			Don't worry about old Tom.

<b>20	ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
	TOM and the stews walk to a VW with a sun roof.

	Nearby REESE and TRIPLETTE get into their Cadillac, behind it the 
	Replacement Party car. Coming from the loudspeakers a tape-
	recorded VOICE:

<b>					VOICE
</b>			Have you thought about your future 
			and what America needs to examine...

	Behind the Replacement Party car is an airport bus with "Connie 
	White" posters on the side. GLENN is one or the passengers. He 
	cranes his neck to continue watching the runway and BARBARA JEAN.

<b>21	EXT. PARKING LOT
</b>
	NORMAN'S limo, with BILL and MARY, follows traffic as the 
	TRICYCLE MAN fires up his machine. WADE'S car with SUELEEN also 
	joins the procession.

<b>22	ANGLE TOWARD RUNWAY
</b>
	The orange ambulance has moved into the area near the plane and 
	there seems to be a great deal at activity.

	REESE and TRIPLETTE'S car stops, and they rush out and run into 
	HAVEN, who is shouting for people to get the hell out of the way.

<b>23	NEW ANGLE
</b>
	Two ambulance ATTENDANTS cut through the crowd. HAVEN, TRIPLETTE 
	and REESE rush near. BARNETT is on his knees over BARBARA JEAN, 
	who has collapsed. The ATTENDANTS lean over her with ammonia. 
	They test her reflexes, etc..

<b>					ATTENDANT
</b>			How long was she out?

<b>					BARNETT
</b>			Not too long. But she keeps 
			passing out.

	She comes to and looks at them all.

<b>					BARBARA JEAN
</b>				 (oblivious)
			Just give your manna that vitamin 
			E. Makes a world of difference.

	OPAL is on one of the house phones, talking to Paris. We can also 
	HEAR the HOUSE PHONE OPERATOR behind the switchboard desk. OPAL

	CONNIE WHITE and her group step into the lobby. The MC in the

</b>			You sing for people and that's what

</b>			She's fine.

</b>			Well, I just thought I'd call.

<b>					BARNETT
</b>			Well, you did and she's fine. 
			Thanks.

	He hangs up. The NURSE is reading the forms. BARBARA JEAN is 
	going through the flowers... She finds GLENN'S and reads the 
	note.

<b>					NURSE
</b>			Well, I don't know.

<b>					BARNETT
</b>			I have a nurse waiting for her in

<b>					BARBARA JEAN
</b>			Who brought these?

<b>					NURSE
</b>			I don't remember seeing those.

<b>					BARNETT
</b>			Somebody brought them. Come on,

	She puts them on the gurney with the others.

<b>					BARBARA JEAN
</b>			Well, thank you all so much. You 
			tell the other ladies thank you.

<b>					NURSE
</b>			Well all right.

	As they start out, DELBERT enters.

<b>					REESE
</b>			How is she?

<b>					BARNETT
</b>			A little slow, but she'll be fine.

<b>					REESE
</b>			Have you talked to Triplette?

<b>					BARNETT
</b>			Who the hell is he?

<b>					REESE
</b>			He's lining up talent for Hal 
			Phillip Walker.

<b>					BARNETT
</b>			Who the hell is he?

<b>					REESE
</b>			He's going to run for president.

<b>					BARNETT
</b>			Third party?

<b>					REESE
</b>			He has that sign with the tree.

<b>					BARNETT
</b>			What does he want?

<b>					REESE
</b>			Barbara Jean.

<b>					BARNETT
</b>			What!

<b>					REESE
</b>			That's what he wants.

<b>					BARNETT
</b>			You know better than that.

<b>					REESE
</b>			It's on National television, 
			Barnett.

<b>					BARNETT
</b>			I don't care. She's always been 
			neutral in politics and that's not 
			going to change.

	There is a pause. BARNETT and REESE have been talking away from 
<b>	BARBARA JEAN.
</b>
<b>					REESE
</b>			Well, how about the shopping 
			center?

<b>					BARNETT
</b>			Yes. She's pretty rested up.

<b>					REESE
</b>			Okay, then we'll see you there.

			You get her those Vitamin E right

			I got them right here.

	BARBARA JEAN feels BARNETT'S impatience to go.

<b>					BARBARA JEAN 
</b>			Well, Bye, Bye now. We have to go.

</b>			Bye, Bye.

	She goes on out the door as he walks to the desk.

</b>			Yes, ma'am. How are you today?

<b>					NURSE
</b>			Didn't you get?... How are you?

<b>					GREEN
</b>			I'm fine. Can I go up?

<b>					NURSE
</b>			Let me see if I can get the doctor 
			hold on one second.

	She makes several phone calls and can't locate anyone. She sighs 
	and hangs up.

<b>					GREEN
</b>			You want me to wait?

<b>					NURSE
</b>			No. Mr. Green, I don't know how to 
			tell you this -- your wire passed 
			away -- I thought they'd called you 
			at home.

	GREEN has and hasn't heard.

<b>					GREEN
</b>			What?

<b>					NURSE
</b>				 (louder)
			Your wire Ester - she passed away.

	He is stunned.

<b>					NURSE
</b>			If you'll wait Just a minute I'll 
			get everything from the business 
			office.

<b>146B	ANOTHER ANGLE

	He wanders to the waiting area. GLENN has been looking out the 
	window at BARBARA JEAN getting into the bus. He comes back and 
	begins to talk to GREEN so caught up in her he doesn't register 
	GREEN'S grief.

<b>					GLENN
</b>				 (loudly)
			My mamma used to know her... They 
			lived next door to each other... she 
			said she was always nursing the sick 
			animals.

	GREEN looks at him and nods. He's still got the vitamins in his 
	hand.

<b>					GLENN
</b>			I really learned all about her from 
			my Momma -- She's been saving this 
			scrap book about her since she got 
			to be famous.

	GREEN nods.

<b>					GLENN
</b>			The one thing she said to me when I 
			joined was "When you're doing your 
			travels you be sure you see Barbara 
			Jean. You don't have to say 
			anything about me but you be sure 
			you see her."  So that's what I've 
			been doing. Now I'm going to hitch 
			a ride so I can see her in Memphis.

	GREEN nods.

<b>					GLENN
</b>			You give my test to your wife1

	GREEN nods and puts the vitamins in his pocket as the NURSE calls 
	from the desk.

	She removes her coat and exposes a costume that looks like a

	TIRIPLETTE stares blatantly and REESE can hardly keep his hands

<b>					SUELEEN
</b>			You like it?  Listen, where is the

	She hands over a stack of music.

	They continue to walk past the many places. 

<b>					TRIPLETTE
</b>			Have you ever done this before?

	She shakes her head, "no" quite caught up in air.

<b>					TRIPLETTE
</b>			Well, it's not too hard. You'll 
			sing whatever it is you want to 
			sing. They'll applaud like crazy 
			'cause I can tell them that you're 
			really something and then the piano 
			and drum will give you a little 
			fanfare and you can sing and take 
			off your clothes or not sing. It 
			really doesn't make much difference, 
			really. But since you've never done 
			this before, singing might help.

	They are near three enormous beef legs waiting to go into the 
	oven. 

<b>					TRIPLETTE
</b>			Now this is to raise funds for 
			someone who can help people who are 
			less fortunate than yourself. The

	A large group of people starts out the door, among them TOM and 
	L.A. JOAN. TOM steers himself and JOAN to LINNEA'S table. BILL

	There is a group groan. BARNETT looks for some under-standing

</b>			No, you don't, so don't say you do. 
			Bunch of damn liars. What do you 
			get out or this?

<b>					TRIPLETTE
</b>			Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.

<b>					BARNETT
</b>			Your job, huh.

	He removes a pen and paper and writes down the following as he 
	speaks.

<b>					BARNETT
</b>			She will not appear on the stage or 
			support that Walker guy and you 
			can't have any of his signs up while 
			she sings. She'll be on first and 
			out of the park before he shows up. 
			There will be no pictures, no 
			questions, no answers or tying her 
			name up with his now or in the 
			future to come. Any money she makes 
			will go to the President of the 
			United States.

	He calls over his secretary and makes TRIPLETTE sign the 
	statement. Then the secretary signs.

<b>					BARNETT
</b>			We'll see you tomorrow. I'll send 
			her three songs over this afternoon. 
			She'll be done about ten minutes 
			after she starts and Walker better 
			not show up till she's through. Now, 
			get out of here.

	TRIPLETTE extends his hand expecting friendship. BARRETT ignores 
	it. As TRIPLETTE leaves, a MAN who has been after BARNETT'S 
	attention steps up. BARNETT turns to his secretary.

<b>					MAN
</b>			Barnett?

<b>					BARNETT
</b>				 (sharply)
			What?

<b>					MAN
</b>			Well, Barnett, I have this terrific 
			song I've been working on. It would 
			be a natural for Barbara Jean. Like 
			you to take a look at it.

	BARNETT looks at him suspiciously.

<b>					BARNETT
</b>			I'm very busy right now.
				 (to secretary) 
				 Get me Haven.

<b>					MAN
</b>			It'll just take a minute. Here, 
			I'll even hold it for you.

	BABNETT sighs and skims over the paper. Song stealing is the 
	same as horse stealing to BARNETT. He becomes enraged.

<b>					BARNETT
</b>			I don't know where you got this, 
			but something tells me you stole it 
			and I hate thieves.

	The MAN takes the paper back and tries to walk away from him -- 
	BARNETT yells after him.

<b>					BARNETT
</b>			Aren't you an engineer...?  I know 
			you -- Don't you work at one of 
			those cut a record places...? 
			Twenty-five bucks a shot, isn't it? 
			Usually their last twenty-five...

	The MAN backs up and BARNETT follows him. They have entered the 
	crowd. The MAB starts to run. BARNETT runs after him. When the 
	MAN gets into the car. BARNETT picks up a rock, throws it and 
	hits the windshield with it. The car MISFIRES but finally 
	starts.. As the MAN drives off, BARNETT stands watching until 
	he's out of sight.

<b>	CUT TO:
</b>
	((THE FOLLOWING Is INTERCUT WITH THE SHOPPING CENTER)

<b>186	EXT. FAIRGROUND - DAY
</b>
	We SEE a fairground, then a roller rink, and a wrestling ring, 
	and finally a small portable stage in the center of a circular 
	track. The grandstands are partially ruled and stock cars roar 
	from another part or the field;

	Around the stage -we SEE a sign that says, "Talent Show Tonight" 
	and we see the contestants and the MC, and NORMAN doing a routine 
	with an accordion player. After NORMAN finishes, the NC takes 
	the mike.

<b>					MC
</b>			Thank you, Mr. Berguan. And now we 
			bring you, 'Albuquerque.'

<b>187	NEW ANGLE
</b>
	ALBUQUERQUE walks to the mike. 

<b>					ALBUQUERQUE
</b>			Hello, everybody. My name is 
			Albuquerque.

	There are-a few nasty remarks.

<b>					ALBUQUERQUE
</b>			I'm going to sing a wonderful tune.

	She starts to sing, "You're an Old Smoothie," and as she does the 
	stock cars leave the pit and drive to the entrance of the track. 
	ALEBUQUERQUE, disturbed at first, sings louder. The cars are 
	waiting for the talent show to set off the track.

<b>188	NEW ANGLE
</b>
	Albuquerque starts to take off her clothes. The MC hasn't 
	noticed, but the grandstand has. People shout, "Take it off..."  
	ALBUQUERQUE loves it. Before ALBUQUERQUE can remove the last two 
	garments, the MC rushes over and grabs the mike.

<b>					MC
</b>			We'd 1ike~to announce the winner of 
			tonight's contest. Albuquerque, How 
			about some applause for a darling 
			little lady

<b>					ALBUQUERQUE
</b>			Oh, I'm not through.

<b>					MC
</b>			That's all, folks.

	The stands are calling to have her take it all off and her fellow 
	contestants are furious. RAVEN, BUD and PEARL are there and they 
	discuss her act.

<b>					MC
</b>			Here is the twenty dollars first 
			prize money and a seat in the 
			grandstands and now let's turn the 
			show over to Al Allen in the race 
			stand.

	He shuts oft the mike.

<b>189	NEW ANGLE - TRACK
</b>
	The stock cars start around the track and stop in front or the 
	race announcer.

<b>	AL
</b>			Congratulations to Albuquerque and 
			welcome, everyone, to the Memorial 
			Race for Billy Apple, who died a 
			week ago in a wreck at this very 
			track, and we want you to know his 
			last words were, 'Are the other 
			fellows all right?'

	A wave of applause and we SEE the talent show make its way across 
	the rack. The platform is already torn down and the MC is 
	helping ALBUQUERQUE dress. As she passes the drivers, they cheer 
	and she blows them a kiss and loses her first garment as she 
	does. More cheers.

<b>190	NEW ANGLE
</b>
	The cars are dented. On the side of one car it says, "Haven 
	Hamilton," and now we see him, BUD and PEARL in the stands. On 
	the side of another car it says, "Connie White."

<b>	AL
</b>	Want you all to save a dime every day and next Saturday we'll 
	take up a collection and give it all to Billy Apple's wife. 
	Share. Their four kids will sure miss their daddy. Want to 
	announce Bob Trilltree is out of the hospital now. Hope you'll 
	be back with us soon. All right, would you stand, please?

	The people stand to a scratchy record of the National Anthem. A 
	'74 Pontiac circles the track with a man holding a medium-sized 
	American flag which flaps as the convertible drive.. At the end 
	of the song the Pontiac drives off the track.

<b>	AL
</b>	This is for Billy Apple. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, let's pick 
	ourselves a winner.

<b>191	NEW ANGLE
</b>
	The drivers get into their cars and start up. The track man 
	waves a flag which starts them around the track in pairs. We 
	notice the TRICYCLE MAN, who has been there all the time. The 
	race starts and the SOUND is deafening. ALBUQUERQUE is thrilled 
	to death. Suddenly, STAR sneaks up on her as she whistles with 
	her fingers in her mouth.

<b>					STAR
</b>			Winifred.

<b>					ALBUQUERQUE
</b>			Hi! Star.

<b>					STAR
</b>			Winifred, the kids want you home 
			and so do I.

<b>					ALBUQUERQUE
</b>			I won first prize.

<b>					STAR
</b>			Come on.

	She has no choice but to follow him out. Several people 
	compliment her as she leaves the grandstand. She buys a bag of 
	peanuts on the way out.

<b>192	INT. TOM'S MOTEL ROOM
</b>
<b>	CUT TO:
</b>
	There is some lovemaking going on in Tom's bed.

<b>					TOM
</b>			You're really terrific, you know 
			what I mean --LINNEA rolls over and 
			faces him.

<b>					LINNEA
</b>			I have to go.

<b>					TOM
</b>			Wrong.

<b>					LINNEA
</b>			I have to go. He sighs.

<b>					TOM
</b>			I know.

	She makes a more to leave.

<b>					TOM
</b>			Stay.

<b>					LINNEA
</b>			I can't.

<b>					TOM
</b>			Car pool?

	She laughs and eases out of the bed.

<b>					TOM
</b>			When did you think it would happen?

<b>					LINNEA
</b>			I'm not sure.

<b>					TOM
</b>			I knew when I first met you.

<b>					LINNEA
</b>			Oh.

	She starts to go into the bathroom.

<b>					TOM
</b>			How old are you?

<b>					LINNEA
</b>			Older.

<b>					TOM
</b>			Thirty?

<b>					LINNEA
</b>			Well...

<b>					TOM
</b>			I'm twenty-eight

<b>					LINNEA
</b>			Oh.

<b>					TOM
</b>			Older than thirty?

	She nods.

<b>					TOM
</b>			Terrific!  Who was that black guy? 
			A friend of yours?

<b>					LINNEA
</b>			That's unkind.

<b>					TOM
</b>			Come on, you ever been attracted to 
			a black guy?

	She looks at him close, then goes into the bathroom and shuts the 
	door.

<b>193	INT. MOTEL BATHROOM - AFTERNOON
</b>
	We HEAR TOM making a phone call. LINNEA grabs a towel and wraps 
	it around her head and throws back the shower curtain, only to 
	find a huge black cockroach in the tub. TOM laughs as she shuts 
	the curtain in horror, then she proceeds to take a sponge bath. 
	She leaves the bathroom quickly.

<b>194	INT. MOTEL ROOM - AFTERNOON
</b>
	TOM is still on the phone. LINNEA dresses, but can't find her 
	slip. She finishes and heads for the door.

<b>					TOM
</b>				 (into phone)
			Just a minute.

	He steps to LINNEA and puts his arms around her. 

<b>					TOM
</b>			I'll talk to you tomorrow.

<b>					LINNEA
</b>			That's what you said before.

<b>					TOM
</b>			I know. Goodbye.

	He kisses her and walks back to the bed. As she gets to the 
	door, she is hit with something,  It is her slip.

<b>					TOM
</b>			Maybe you better keep that.

	He smiles and she walks out the door.

<b>195	EXT. TOM'S MOTEL ROOM - AFTERNOON
</b>
	Outside, LINNEA hangs the slip on the doorknob and leaves.

<b>	CUT TO:

<b>196	INT. GREEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	GREEN is in bed. KENNY takes away a tray of cookies and hot 
	chocolate.

	You okay?

<b>					GREEN
</b>			Sure... you're a fine boy, Ken, you 
			really are.

<b>					KENNY
</b>			Okay... you get to sleep. I'll see 
			you in the morning. Good night.

<b>					GREEN
</b>			Good night,

	KENNY turns out the light and calls the dog. GREEN settles into 
	his pillow.

<b>	END OF TUESDAY.
</b>
<b>	CUT TO:
</b>
<b>197	EXT. CEMETERY - MORNING
</b>
	A small, empty last rite for MRS. GREEN. KENNY and GREEN are at 
	the grave. In the distance, the TRICYCLE MAN watches.

<b>					GREEN
</b>			I guess she's not coming...

<b>	CUT TO:
</b>
<b>198	EXT. PATHENON - MORNING
</b>
	Preparation for the big televised rally.

<b>	CUT TO:
</b>
<b>199	EXT. PERCY WARNER PARK - DAY
</b>
	Outside the Parthenon, KENNY, with his violin case, waits for 
	some food at the barbecue. ALBUQUERQUE'S who has fled STAR 
	again, waits near him. BARNETT is talking to REESE.

<b>200	ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
	TRIPLETTE is at the stairs. GLENN is trying to get past a guard 
	and finally TRIPLETTE recognizing him from the shopping center, 
	helps him in. They enter the stair area, near all the TV cables 
	and equipment.

<b>201	NEW ANGLE
</b>
	They approach BARBARA JEAN, who is talking to musicians. BILL and 
	MARY are there with NORMAN, and LINNEA is singing on stage with 
	the black choir. TOMMY now steps up to talk to BARBARA JEAN.

<b>202	NEW ANGLE
</b>
	GLENN is lost in BARBARA JEAN'S magic. She smiles at him, but in 
	talking to HAVEN, BUD and PEARL and looking for BARNETT. 
	TRIPLETTE walks by GLENN.

<b>					GLENN
</b>			Listen, could you give her this for 
			me?

	TRIPLETTE takes a note from GLENN.

<b>					TRIPLETTE
</b>			Sure thing. 

<b>					GLENN
</b>			Thanks.

<b>					TRIPLETTE
</b>
	TRIPLETTE hands her the note as BARRETT angrily steps up. 
	Someone calls  "places."

<b>					BARNETT
</b>			They screwed up. You go on after 
			the choir.

	TOMMY BROWN joins LINNEA and the choir on stage. We SEE TOM 
	wandering and avoiding BILL, but catching MARY'S eye. OPAL is 
	near as is LA JOAN. BARBARA JEAN reads GLENN'S note: "If I die 
	tomorrow, I lived today."

<b>203	NEW ANGLE
</b>
	The applause builds.

<b>					ANNOUNCER
</b>			Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Barbara 
			Jean...

	The audience is swept away.

<b>204	NEW ANGLE
</b>
	In the audience we see KENNY and the TRICYCLE MAN and WADE. 
	SUELEEN is there, too.

<b>205	ANOTHER ANGLE -- STAGE AREA
</b>
	As BARBARA JEAN sings, GLENN stands next to BARNETT. She finishes 
	the song and looks in GLENN'S direction.

<b>206	ANGLE - BARBARA JEAN
</b>
	She is leaning on a stool.

<b>					BARBARA JEAN
</b>			I want to thank you for all your 
			good wishes. You are so important 
			to Barnett and me. Now I want to 
			sing a special song for all our 
			soldier boys.

	The orchestra starts. She calls for HAVEN to come out. The 
	applause swells and, they start a song together.

<b>207	EXT. FRONT OF PARK - DAY
</b>
	A long black limo is parked near two ambulances, the attendants 
	sitting on the ambulance fenders and joking.

<b>208	ANGLE - STAGE
</b>
	BARBARA JEAN and HAVEN have finished the soldier song. The choir 
	comes out to back her now. The audience picks up the song they 
	sing. After the song everyone claps loudly, and a large bouquet 
	of flowers gets handed up to BARBARA JEAN. They hug as someone 
	begins to unfurl a "HAL PHILIP WALKER" banner behind them. 
	Photographers crowd in. Suddenly there is a sharp jolt in 
	HAVEN'S body and BARBARA JEAN is down. There is brief confusion, 
	but the choir continues to sing and everyone thinks BARBARA JEAN 
	has fainted again.

<b>209	NEW ANGLE
</b>
	The confusion mounts as both HAVEN and BARBARA JEAN are down and 
	there are flowers lying all over the place

<b>					HAVEN
</b>			Barnett!  My God, Barnett  I'm 
			shot!

	TRIPLETTE runs up the stairs and the choir continues. BARNETT 
	yells for them to stop. He and BARNETT are over BARRARA JEAN, 
	while guards and BUD attend to HAVEN.

<b>					TRIPLETTE
</b>			She's... oh, my God... there's 
			blood here...
				 (taking mike)
			Ladies and gentlemen, I don't know 
			what to say.

<b>210	ANGLE - AUDIENCE
</b>
	There is a VOICE among the noise that shouts:

	I could have got that Walker bastard before. I've been closer, 
	closer than this, but my Nash broke down and somebody kept 
	stealing my things. I wanted to get him the day before, then Mr. 
	Green's wire died, so this was the right time. I love the 
	President of the United States. I love him.

	Guards grab the speaker, KENNY, in an instant. He shoots a 
	policeman's foot by accident. Men swallow him up. Someone 
	yells, "sing."

<b>211	ANGLE - STAGE
</b>
	The choir has no direction to go in. ALRUQUERQUE suddenly is 
	with microphone.. She starts to do "It Don't Worry Me."  The rest 
	of the singers join in.

<b>212	EXT. PERCY WALKER PARK - DAY
</b>
	BARNETT leads the stretcher to one or the ambulances. He doesn't 
	allow HAVEN to enter.

<b>					BARNETT
</b>			Have your friend Triplette take you 
			to the hospital.

	A man walks up from the limo. It is WALKER. TRIPLETTE is near.

<b>					 WALKER
</b>	What'd she do, faint again?  I'm getting tired of waiting in the 
	car.

	TRIPLETTE turns and belts him.

<b>	CUT TO:
</b>
<b>213	INT. AMBULANCE - DAY
</b>
	As it speeds to the hospital. BARNETT is calm. He knows none of 
	it matters anyway.

<b>214	EXT. STREETS - DAY
</b>
	The TRICYCLE MAN follows the ambulance, then heads off onto the 
	highway to Memphis. We SEE STAR'S truck going toward the 
	Parthenon.

<b>215	EXT. PARTHENON
</b>
	We SEE STAR'S truck arrive and park. He gets out, as the music 
	and chaos swell.
