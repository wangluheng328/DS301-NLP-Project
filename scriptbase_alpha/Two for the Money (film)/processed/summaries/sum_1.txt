In Vegas, after breaking the knee in a game, the former promising football player Brandon Lang has to work in a phone service foreseeing the results of the games due to the lack of professional options.
After many successful predictions, he is invited by Walter Abrams to move to Manhattan and work with him in his gambling advising business.
Brandon changes his name and personality, becomes famous advising clients and close to Walter's family, and a good friend of his wife, the owner of a hairdresser saloon Toni Morrow.
When the predictions of Brandon fail, he feels that it is time to return home.
