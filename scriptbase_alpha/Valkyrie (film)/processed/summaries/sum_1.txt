By 1944, many senior German officers knew they would lose the war and that honorable surrender was the only way out.
To do so however, they will have to eliminate their greatest obstacle - Adolf Hitler.
There had been several attempts on Hitler's life but all had failed.
The leaders of the conspiracy recruit the aristocratic Col. Claus von Stauffenberg, who had lost his left eye and right hand in action in North Africa, to lead their latest operation.
The plan has Stauffenberg placing a bomb in the Fuhrer's bunker, the Wolf's Lair, and then returning to Berlin to take charge of the operation, which will include rounding up the SS and Josef Goebbels.
When Hitler survives the blast, it all begins to fall apart.
Based on a true story.
