A young Carl Fredrickson meets a young adventure-spirited girl named Ellie.
They both dream of going to a lost land in South America.
70 years later, Ellie has died.
Carl remembers the promise he made to her.
Then, when he inadvertently hits a construction worker, he is forced to go to a retirement home.
But before they can take him, he and his house fly away.
However, he has a stowaway aboard: an 8-year-old boy named Russell, who's trying to get an Assisting the Elderly badge.
Together, they embark on an adventure, where they encounter talking dogs, an evil villain and a rare bird named Kevin.
