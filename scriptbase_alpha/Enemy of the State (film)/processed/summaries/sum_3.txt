When lawyer Robert Clayton Dean meets an old pal accidentally, he does not know the trouble that is going to hit him.
His pal, being pursued badly, slips him a disc without Robert reckoning - before being killed.
Soon, Robert is believed to have something that others want - but what?
Later, he stumbles across a setup that would render him the main suspect of a gruesome murder, hadn't he dropped by.
Being shown several bugs by Brill, a trustable contact of the victim, Robert learns quickly about the fire he's playing with - and decides to win instead of giving up.
The murder case of a staged suicide by a U.S. congressman may cause some heads to roll, if the disc containing the proof can be found in time and delivered to its destination - by the right party, that is.
