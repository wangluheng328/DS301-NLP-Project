During WWII, in Stalag (which is German for prison) 17, the prisoners are dumbfounded as to how the Germans know when someone's trying to escape.
Recently, two tried to escape and never made past just outside the camp.
Sefton, a hustler and wheeler dealer, said that they wouldn't.
And it also seems that Sefton doesn't mind that he has to trade with the Germans for some extra food or whatever and has no desire to escape.
When they lose some valuable materials like a radio, or when a Lieutenant Dunbar, who just arrived, and who also blew up an ammunition train, and who also has some (unpleasant) history with Sefton, is arrested, they assume that Sefton's an informant.
And while Sefton adamantly claims he is not, they don't turn their back on him or trust him, and would like nothing better than to tear him apart.
Can Sefton find out who the real informant is?
