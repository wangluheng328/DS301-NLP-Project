<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHILI
<br/></p><p id="dia">They don't want to deposit yours and have it bounce. That annoys them. So your dear friend Dick Allen's been calling, leaving messages on your machine, but you never get back to him. I happen to be in Vegas on another matter, and Dick asks me as a favor would I look you up. I follow you over here, see you in the window with this woman, looks a lot like that actress Karen Flores, was in Grotesque, except she's not blond anymore . . .

<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">HARRY
<br/></p><p id="dia">So, you want me to call you a cab? 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="act">Chili shakes his head, keeps staring at Harry, but with a different expression now, more thoughtful, curious. 
<br/>

<br/></p><p id="dia">You make movies, huh? 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">HARRY
<br/></p><p id="dia">I produce feature motion pictures, no TV. You mentioned Grotesque, that happened to be Grotesque Part II that Karen Flores was in. She starred in all three of my Slime Creatures releases you might have seen. 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="act">Chili nods, leans forward on the desk.

<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">HARRY
<br/></p><p id="dia">We're gonna make the picture. I've just got another project to do first, that's all. One I promised this guy years ago. 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="act">Chili shakes his head, he can't believe he's hearing this. Ronnie sits up straight.

<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">RONNIE
<br/></p><p id="dia">I want to see your books, Harry. Show me where it is, a two with five zeroes after it in black and white, man. I want to see your books and your bank statements.

<br/></p><p id="dia">Hey, Ronnie? Look at me.

<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHILI
<br/></p><p id="dia">You have a piece of a movie, that's all. You don't have a piece of Harry. He told you we're doing another movie first. And that's the way it's gonna be.

<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHILI

<br/></p><p id="dia">You can talk to me. 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHILI
<br/></p><p id="dia">That's what I thought. So let me put it this way 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="act">Now it's between them. The guy studies Chili, thinks about whether or not to make a move, when Harry steps in, reaches over the desk and picks up a script . . . 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">HARRY
<br/></p><p id="dia">This is the project, Mr. Lovejoy. I'm not trying to pull anything on you guys. This is it, right here. 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="act">Chili looks at Harry, wonders if there's a way to shut him up without punching him in the mouth. 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">RONNIE
<br/></p><p id="dia">Mr. Loveboy? What is it, Harry, a porno flick? 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="act">He reaches for the script. Harry backs away, holds the script to his chest. Bo Catlett notices this. 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">HARRY
<br/></p><p id="dia">It's nothing. It's fluff. Nothing you'd be interested in. 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="act">Bo Catlett eyes him a beat, then pushes out of his chair . . . 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">BO CATLETT
<br/></p><p id="dia">Harry, you think we go to see your movies? I've seen better film on teeth. Makes no difference to me which one our money's in. So how 'bout you take our twenty points out of Freaks and put 'em in this other one, Mr. Loverboy. 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">HARRY
<br/></p><p id="dia">I can't do it. 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">BO CATLETT
<br/></p><p id="dia">You positive about that? 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">HARRY
<br/></p><p id="dia">It's a different kind of deal. 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="act">Bo Catlett nods, gets up. 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">BO CATLETT
<br/></p><p id="dia">Okay. Then be good enough to hand us our money back, or you think about us coming in on this new one. 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">RONNIE
<br/></p><p id="dia">By Friday, man, or you're fuckin' dead as disco. 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="act">Ronnie opens his coat so that Harry can see a gun tucked in his belt . . . 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">RONNIE
<br/></p><p id="dia">You hear me? 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="act">Bo Catlett gives Ronnie a look. 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">BO CATLETT
<br/></p><p id="dia">Take your time, Harry.
<br/></p><p id="spkdir">(closes Ronnie's jacket)
<br/></p><p id="dia">We're not animals. Are we, Ronnie? 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="act">Bo Catlett glances once more at Chili then follows Ronnie out the door. Harry stares at the door a moment, senses Chili staring at him . . . 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">HARRY
<br/></p><p id="dia">What? 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHILI
<br/></p><p id="dia">I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought . . . I told you to keep your mouth shut. 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">HARRY
<br/></p><p id="dia">I had to tell 'em something. 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHILI
<br/></p><p id="dia">Never say anything unless you have to.

<br/></p><p></p><p id="act">Chili shakes his head as Harry sits down in one of the chairs, fumbles for his cigarettes. 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHILI
<br/></p><p id="dia">You tell me you want these guys off your back. Next thing I know, you're saying yeah, maybe they can have a piece of Mr. Lovejoy. I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears. 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">HARRY
<br/></p><p id="dia">I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing. 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHILI
<br/></p><p id="dia">That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink. 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">HARRY

<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">HARRY
<br/></p><p id="dia">What she did not say was, 'I just loved the way the director moved the camera so much it made me fuckin' seasick.' All she cared about was that look. All she remembered was that look. And why do we remember things in movies? Because we can see them.

<br/></p><p id="dia">You know how to write one of these? 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">BO CATLETT
<br/></p><p id="dia">There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words . . . although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done.

<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHILI

<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHILI
<br/></p><p id="dia">Martin, I'm not connected to those people anymore. Not since I walked out of a loan-shark Operation in Miami.

<br/></p><p id="dia">Oh, for Christ's sake -- 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">MARTIN
<br/></p><p id="dia">I know. I'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock. Okay, what's my motivation? The acquisition of money. To collect. Inflict pain if I have to. 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="act">Karen watches as Martin stares at Chili, his expression gradually becoming deadpan, sleepy . . . 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">MARTIN

<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="act">So is Karen, for that matter. 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHILI
<br/></p><p id="dia">No, I want you to look at me the way I'm looking at you. Put it in your eyes, 'You're mine, asshole,' without saying it. 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">MARTIN
<br/></p><p id="dia">Like this? 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHILI
<br/></p><p id="dia">What you're telling me, you're tired? You wanna go to bed?

<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHILI
<br/></p><p id="dia">Now you're squinting like you need glasses. 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="act">Karen looks away now, fighting a smile. 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHILI
<br/></p><p id="dia">Look at me. I'm thinking, You're mine. I fuckin' own you. What I'm not doing is feeling anything about it one way or the other. You understand? You're not a person to me, you're a name in my collection book, a guy owes me money, that's all. 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="act">Martin nods, gives Chili a nice dead-eyed look. Karen is thoroughly enjoying Chili's manipulation of Martin.

<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHILI

<br/></p><p></p><p id="act">Chili gets to his feet. Bones motions with the gun and he turns to face the painting over the sofa. Bones comes over and lifts his wallet from his back pocket. 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">BONES
<br/></p><p id="dia">You're the dumbest fucking guy I ever met in my life. Let's see what's in your pockets. 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="act">His face still to the wall, Chili shoves his hands in and pulls the side pockets out. Bones turns away. 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">BONES
<br/></p><p id="dia">What you should've done was told me about Leo Devoe as soon as you found out. 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="act">Chili looks over his shoulder to see Bones pulling his suitcoat from the back of the chair . . . 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHILI
<br/></p><p id="dia">Why would I do that? 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">BONES
<br/></p><p id="dia">'Cause the guy's a customer now, stupid. His ass belongs to me. 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="act">Bones lays the pistol on the conuter, holds the suitcoat with one hand and feels through it with the other expression changes, his eyes open wider. 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">BONES
<br/></p><p id="dia">What have we here? 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="act">His hand comes out of the suitcoat with the LOCKER KEY. Chili sits down on the sofa again; he can't believe how easy this is gonna be . . . 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHILI
<br/></p><p id="dia">Give me my cigarettes. They're in the inside pocket. 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="act">Bones throws him the coat. 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">BONES
<br/></p><p id="dia">Help yourself.

<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">BONES
<br/></p><p id="dia">I wonder what this's for, a locker? Yeah, but where is it? 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="act">Chili sits back to smoke his cigarette, lets it happen. 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHILI
<br/></p><p id="dia">I checked the bag at the airport, when I came. 
<br/>

<br/></p><p id="dia">Why haven't you left? 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHILI
<br/></p><p id="dia">I like it here. 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="act">Chili shrugs. Bones eyes the key a moment, then . . . 
<br/>
<br/></p><p></p><p id="speaker">BONES
<br/></p><p id="dia">Look, there's no reason you and I shouldn't get along. Forget all the bullshit from before -- I don't even remember how it started. You took a swing at me over some fuckin' thing, whatever it was -- forget it. You owe me some money, right? Forget that too. But, you don't say a fuckin' word about this to anybody. It's strictly between you and me, right?
