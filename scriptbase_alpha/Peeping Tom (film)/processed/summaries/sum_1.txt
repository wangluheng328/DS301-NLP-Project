In London, lonely photographer Mark Lewis works in a film studio and moonlights supplying cheesecake photos to a magazine store.
He lives in the huge house that he had inherited from his parents that is rented to tenants to help him pay the bills and keep the building.
Mark was the subject of bizarre experiments of effects of the fear conducted by his scientist father since he was a child and he has become a disturbed man obsessed by the face of frightened women in the moment of death.
He kills women filming their faces while he stabs them in the throat.
When Mark meets his neighbor and tenant Helen Stephens on the day of her birthday, he befriends her and soon he dates the young woman.
Mark has a crush on Helen and does not want to film her.
But Mark is one of the suspects and a detective is tracking him down.
